<p>This is <em>not</em> a strict single-point-of-departure fic -
there exists a primary point of departure, at some point in the
past, but also other alterations. The best term I've heard for this
fic is "parallel universe".</p>
<p>The text contains many clues: obvious clues, not-so-obvious
clues, truly obscure hints which I was shocked to see some readers
successfully decode, and massive evidence left out in plain sight.
This is a rationalist story; its mysteries are solvable, and meant
to be solved.</p>
<p>The pacing of the story is that of serial fiction, i.e., that of
a TV show running for a predetermined number of seasons, whose
episodes are individually plotted but with an overall arc building
to a final conclusion.</p>
<p>The story has been corrected to British English up to Ch. 17,
and further Britpicking is currently in progress (see the /HPMOR
subreddit).</p>
<p>All science mentioned is real science. But please keep in mind
that, beyond the realm of science, the views of the characters may
not be those of the author. Not everything the protagonist does is
a lesson in wisdom, and advice offered by darker characters may be
untrustworthy or dangerously double-edged.</p>

<p>Every inch of wall space is covered by a bookcase. Each bookcase
has six shelves, going almost to the ceiling. Some bookshelves are
stacked to the brim with hardback books: science, maths, history,
and everything else. Other shelves have two layers of paperback
science fiction, with the back layer of books propped up on old
tissue boxes or lengths of wood, so that you can see the back layer
of books above the books in front. And it still isn't enough. Books
are overflowing onto the tables and the sofas and making little
heaps under the windows.</p>
<p>This is the living-room of the house occupied by the eminent
Professor Michael Verres-Evans, and his wife, Mrs. Petunia
Evans-Verres, and their adopted son, Harry James
Potter-Evans-Verres.</p>
<p>There is a letter lying on the living-room table, and an
unstamped envelope of yellowish parchment, addressed to <em>Mr. H.
Potter</em> in emerald-green ink.</p>
<p>The Professor and his wife are speaking sharply at each other,
but they are not shouting. The Professor considers shouting to be
uncivilised.</p>
<p>"You're joking," Michael said to Petunia. His tone indicated
that he was very much afraid that she was serious.</p>
<p>"My sister was a witch," Petunia repeated. She looked
frightened, but stood her ground. "Her husband was a wizard."</p>
<p>"This is absurd!" Michael said sharply. "They were at our
wedding - they visited for Christmas -"</p>
<p>"I told them you weren't to know," Petunia whispered. "But it's
true. I've seen things -"</p>
<p>The Professor rolled his eyes. "Dear, I understand that you're
not familiar with the sceptical literature. You may not realise how
easy it is for a trained magician to fake the seemingly impossible.
Remember how I taught Harry to bend spoons? If it seemed like they
could always guess what you were thinking, that's called cold
reading -"</p>
<p>"It wasn't bending spoons -"</p>
<p>"What was it, then?"</p>
<p>Petunia bit her lip. "I can't just tell you. You'll think I'm -"
She swallowed. "Listen. Michael. I wasn't - always like this -" She
gestured at herself, as though to indicate her lithe form. "Lily
did this. Because I - because I <em>begged</em> her. For years, I
begged her. Lily had <em>always</em> been prettier than me, and
I'd... been mean to her, because of that, and then she got
<em>magic,</em> can you imagine how I felt? And I <em>begged</em>
her to use some of that magic on me so that I could be pretty too,
even if I couldn't have her magic, at least I could be pretty."</p>
<p>Tears were gathering in Petunia's eyes.</p>
<p>"And Lily would tell me no, and make up the most ridiculous
excuses, like the world would end if she were nice to her sister,
or a centaur told her not to - the most ridiculous things, and I
hated her for it. And when I had just graduated from university, I
was going out with this boy, Vernon Dursley, he was fat and he was
the only boy who would talk to me. And he said he wanted children,
and that his first son would be named Dudley. And I thought to
myself, <em>what kind of parent names their child Dudley
Dursley?</em> It was like I saw my whole future life stretching out
in front of me, and I couldn't stand it. And I wrote to my sister
and told her that if she didn't help me I'd rather just -"</p>
<p>Petunia stopped.</p>
<p>"Anyway," Petunia said, her voice small, "she gave in. She told
me it was dangerous, and I said I didn't care any more, and I drank
this potion and I was sick for weeks, but when I got better my skin
cleared up and I finally filled out and... I was beautiful, people
were <em>nice</em> to me," her voice broke, "and after that I
couldn't hate my sister any more, especially when I learned what
her magic brought her in the end -"</p>
<p>"Darling," Michael said gently, "you got sick, you gained some
weight while resting in bed, and your skin cleared up on its own.
Or being sick made you change your diet -"</p>
<p>"She was a witch," Petunia repeated. "I saw it."</p>
<p>"Petunia," Michael said. The annoyance was creeping into his
voice. "You <em>know</em> that can't be true. Do I really have to
explain why?"</p>
<p>Petunia wrung her hands. She seemed to be on the verge of tears.
"My love, I know I can't win arguments with you, but please, you
have to trust me on this -"</p>
<p>"<em>Dad! Mum!</em> "</p>
<p>The two of them stopped and looked at Harry as though they'd
forgotten there was a third person in the room.</p>
<p>Harry took a deep breath. "Mum, <em>your</em> parents didn't
have magic, did they?"</p>
<p>"No," Petunia said, looking puzzled.</p>
<p>"Then no one in your family knew about magic when Lily got her
letter. How did <em>they</em> get convinced?"</p>
<p>"Ah..." Petunia said. "They didn't just send a letter. They sent
a professor from Hogwarts. He -" Petunia's eyes flicked to Michael.
"He showed us some magic."</p>
<p>"Then you don't have to fight over this," Harry said firmly.
Hoping against hope that this time, just this once, they would
listen to him. "If it's true, we can just get a Hogwarts professor
here and see the magic for ourselves, and Dad will admit that it's
true. And if not, then Mum will admit that it's false. That's what
the experimental method is for, so that we don't have to resolve
things just by arguing."</p>
<p>The Professor turned and looked down at him, dismissive as
usual. "Oh, come now, Harry. Really, <em>magic?</em> I thought
<em>you'd</em> know better than to take this seriously, son, even
if you're only ten. Magic is just about the most unscientific thing
there is!"</p>
<p>Harry's mouth twisted bitterly. He was treated well, probably
better than most genetic fathers treated their own children. Harry
had been sent to the best primary schools - and when that didn't
work out, he was provided with tutors from the endless pool of
starving students. Always Harry had been encouraged to study
whatever caught his attention, bought all the books that caught his
fancy, sponsored in whatever maths or science competitions he
entered. He was given anything reasonable that he wanted, except,
maybe, the slightest shred of respect. A Doctor teaching
biochemistry at Oxford could hardly be expected to listen to the
advice of a little boy. You would listen to Show Interest, of
course; that's what a Good Parent would do, and so, if you
conceived of yourself as a Good Parent, you would do it. But take a
ten-year-old <em>seriously?</em> Hardly.</p>
<p>Sometimes Harry wanted to scream at his father.</p>
<p>"Mum," Harry said. "If you want to win this argument with Dad,
look in chapter two of the first book of the Feynman Lectures on
Physics. There's a quote there about how philosophers say a great
deal about what science absolutely requires, and it is all wrong,
because the only rule in science is that the final arbiter is
observation - that you just have to look at the world and report
what you see. Um... off the top of my head I can't think of where
to find something about how it's an ideal of science to settle
things by experiment instead of arguments -"</p>
<p>His mother looked down at him and smiled. "Thank you, Harry. But
-" her head rose back up to stare at her husband. "I don't want to
win an argument with your father. I want my husband to, to listen
to his wife who loves him, and trust her just this once -"</p>
<p>Harry closed his eyes briefly. <em>Hopeless.</em> Both of his
parents were just hopeless.</p>
<p>Now his parents were getting into one of <em>those</em>
arguments again, one where his mother tried to make his father feel
guilty, and his father tried to make his mother feel stupid.</p>
<p>"I'm going to go to my room," Harry announced. His voice
trembled a little. "Please try not to fight too much about this,
Mum, Dad, we'll know soon enough how it comes out, right?"</p>
<p>"Of course, Harry," said his father, and his mother gave him a
reassuring kiss, and then they went on fighting while Harry climbed
the stairs to his bedroom.</p>
<p>He shut the door behind him and tried to think.</p>
<p>The funny thing was, he <em>should</em> have agreed with Dad. No
one had ever seen any evidence of magic, and according to Mum,
there was a whole magical world out there. How could anyone keep
something like that a secret? More magic? That seemed like a rather
suspicious sort of excuse.</p>
<p>It should have been a clean case for Mum joking, lying or being
insane, in ascending order of awfulness. If Mum had sent the letter
herself, that would explain how it arrived at the letterbox without
a stamp. A little insanity was far, far less improbable than the
universe really working like that.</p>
<p>Except that some part of Harry was utterly convinced that magic
was real, and had been since the instant he saw the putative letter
from the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.</p>
<p>Harry rubbed his forehead, grimacing. <em>Don't believe
everything you think,</em> one of his books had said.</p>
<p>But this bizarre certainty... Harry was finding himself just
<em>expecting</em> that, yes, a Hogwarts professor would show up
and wave a wand and magic would come out. The strange certainty was
making no effort to guard itself against falsification - wasn't
making excuses in advance for why there wouldn't be a professor, or
the professor would only be able to bend spoons.</p>
<p><em>Where do you come from, strange little prediction?</em>
Harry directed the thought at his brain. <em>Why do I believe what
I believe?</em></p>
<p>Usually Harry was pretty good at answering that question, but in
this particular case, he had no <em>clue</em> what his brain was
thinking.</p>
<p>Harry mentally shrugged. A flat metal plate on a door affords
pushing, and a handle on a door affords pulling, and the thing to
do with a testable hypothesis is to go and test it.</p>
<p>He took a piece of lined paper from his desk, and started
writing.</p>
<p><em>Dear Deputy Headmistress</em></p>
<p>Harry paused, reflecting; then discarded the paper for another,
tapping another millimetre of graphite from his mechanical pencil.
This called for careful calligraphy.</p>
<p><em>Dear Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall,</em></p>
<p><em>Or Whomsoever It May Concern:</em></p>
<p><em>I recently received your letter of acceptance to Hogwarts,
addressed to Mr. H. Potter. You may not be aware that my genetic
parents, James Potter and Lily Potter (formerly Lily Evans) are
dead. I was adopted by Lily's sister, Petunia Evans-Verres, and her
husband, Michael Verres-Evans.</em></p>
<p><em>I am extremely interested in attending Hogwarts, conditional
on such a place actually existing. Only my mother Petunia says she
knows about magic, and she can't use it herself. My father is
highly sceptical. I myself am uncertain. I also don't know where to
obtain any of the books or equipment listed in your acceptance
letter.</em></p>
<p><em>Mother mentioned that you sent a Hogwarts representative to
Lily Potter (then Lily Evans) in order to demonstrate to her family
that magic was real, and, I presume, help Lily obtain her school
materials. If you could do this for my own family it would be
extremely helpful.</em></p>
<p><em>Sincerely,</em></p>
<p><em>Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres.</em></p>
<p>Harry added their current address, then folded up the letter and
put it in an envelope, which he addressed to Hogwarts. Further
consideration led him to obtain a candle and drip wax onto the flap
of the envelope, into which, using a penknife's tip, he impressed
the initials H.J.P.E.V. If he was going to descend into this
madness, he was going to do it with style.</p>
<p>Then he opened his door and went back downstairs. His father was
sitting in the living-room and reading a book of higher maths to
show how smart he was; and his mother was in the kitchen preparing
one of his father's favourite meals to show how loving she was. It
didn't look like they were talking to one another at all. As scary
as arguments could be, <em>not arguing</em> was somehow much
worse.</p>
<p>"Mum," Harry said into the unnerving silence, "I'm going to test
the hypothesis. According to your theory, how do I send an owl to
Hogwarts?"</p>
<p>His mother turned from the kitchen sink to stare at him, looking
shocked. "I - I don't know, I think you just have to own a magic
owl."</p>
<p>That should've sounded highly suspicious, <em>oh, so there's no
way to test your theory then,</em> but the peculiar certainty in
Harry seemed willing to stick its neck out even further.</p>
<p>"Well, the letter got here somehow," Harry said, "so I'll just
wave it around outside and call 'letter for Hogwarts!' and see if
an owl picks it up. Dad, do you want to come and watch?"</p>
<p>His father shook his head minutely and kept on reading. <em>Of
course,</em> Harry thought to himself. Magic was a disgraceful
thing that only stupid people believed in; if his father went so
far as to <em>test</em> the hypothesis, or even <em>watch</em> it
being tested, that would feel like <em>associating</em> himself
with that...</p>
<p>Only as Harry stumped out the back door, into the back garden,
did it occur to him that if an owl <em>did</em> come down and
snatch the letter, he was going to have some trouble telling Dad
about it.</p>
<p><em>But - well - that can't</em> really <em>happen, can it? No
matter what my brain seems to believe. If an owl really comes down
and grabs this envelope, I'm going to have worries a lot more
important than what Dad thinks.</em></p>
<p>Harry took a deep breath, and raised the envelope into the
air.</p>
<p>He swallowed.</p>
<p>Calling out <em>Letter for Hogwarts!</em> while holding an
envelope high in the air in the middle of your own back garden
was... actually pretty embarrassing, now that he thought about
it.</p>
<p><em>No. I'm better than Dad. I will use the scientific method
even if it makes me feel stupid.</em></p>
<p>"Letter -" Harry said, but it actually came out as more of a
whispered croak.</p>
<p>Harry steeled his will, and shouted into the empty sky,
"<em>Letter for Hogwarts! Can I get an owl?</em> "</p>
<p>"Harry?" asked a bemused woman's voice, one of the
neighbours.</p>
<p>Harry pulled down his hand like it was on fire and hid the
envelope behind his back like it was drug money. His whole face was
hot with shame.</p>
<p>An old woman's face peered out from above the neighbouring
fence, grizzled grey hair escaping from her hairnet. Mrs. Figg, the
occasional babysitter. "What are you doing, Harry?"</p>
<p>"Nothing," Harry said in a strangled voice. "Just - testing a
really silly theory -"</p>
<p>"Did you get your acceptance letter from Hogwarts?"</p>
<p>Harry froze in place<em>.</em></p>
<p>"Yes," Harry's lips said a little while later. "I got a letter
from Hogwarts. They say they want my owl by the 31st of July, but
-"</p>
<p>"But you don't <em>have</em> an owl. Poor dear! I can't imagine
<em>what</em> someone must have been thinking, sending you just the
standard letter."</p>
<p>A wrinkled arm stretched out over the fence, and opened an
expectant hand. Hardly even thinking at this point, Harry gave over
his envelope.</p>
<p>"Just leave it to me, dear," said Mrs. Figg, "and in a jiffy or
two I'll have someone over."</p>
<p>And her face disappeared from over the fence.</p>
<p>There was a long silence in the garden.</p>
<p>Then a boy's voice said, calmly and quietly, "What."</p>

<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 3: Comparing Reality To Its
Alternatives<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>If J. K. Rowling asks you about this story, you know
nothing.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>"But then the question is - who?"</em></p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"Good Lord," said the barman, peering at Harry, "is this - can
this be -?"</p>
<p>Harry leaned towards the bar of the Leaky Cauldron as best he
could, though it came up to somewhere around the tips of his
eyebrows. A question like <em>that</em> deserved his very best.</p>
<p>"Am I - could I be - maybe - you never know - if I'm
<em>not</em> - but then the question is - <em>who?</em> "</p>
<p>"Bless my soul," whispered the old barman. "Harry Potter... what
an honour."</p>
<p>Harry blinked, then rallied. "Well, yes, you're quite
perceptive; most people don't realise that so quickly -"</p>
<p>"That's enough," Professor McGonagall said. Her hand tightened
on Harry's shoulder. "Don't pester the boy, Tom, he's new to all
this."</p>
<p>"But it is him?" quavered an old woman. "It's Harry Potter?"
With a scraping sound, she got up from her chair.</p>
<p>"Doris -" McGonagall said warningly. The glare she shot around
the room should have been enough to intimidate anyone.</p>
<p>"I only want to shake his hand," the woman whispered. She bent
low and stuck out a wrinkled hand, which Harry, feeling confused
and more uncomfortable than he ever had in his life, carefully
shook. Tears fell from the woman's eyes onto their clasped hands.
"My granson was an Auror," she whispered to him. "Died in
seventy-nine. Thank you, Harry Potter. Thank heavens for you."</p>
<p>"You're welcome," Harry said automatically, and then he turned
his head and shot Professor McGonagall a frightened, pleading
look.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall slammed her foot down just as the general
rush was about to start. It made a noise that gave Harry a new
referent for the phrase "Crack of Doom", and everyone froze in
place.</p>
<p>"We're in a hurry," Professor McGonagall said in a voice that
sounded perfectly, utterly normal.</p>
<p>They left the bar without any trouble.</p>
<p>"Professor?" Harry said, once they were in the courtyard. He had
meant to ask what was going on, but oddly found himself asking an
entirely different question instead. "Who was that pale man, by the
corner? The man with the twitching eye?"</p>
<p>"Hm?" said Professor McGonagall, sounding a bit surprised;
perhaps she hadn't expected that question either. "That was
Professor Quirinus Quirrell. He'll be teaching Defence Against the
Dark Arts this year at Hogwarts."</p>
<p>"I had the strangest feeling that I knew him..." Harry rubbed
his forehead. "And that I shouldn't ought to shake his hand." Like
meeting someone who had been a friend, once, before something went
drastically wrong... that wasn't really it at all, but Harry
couldn't find words. "And what <em>was...</em> all of that?"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall was giving him an odd glance. "Mr.
Potter... do you know... how <em>much</em> have you been told...
about how your parents died?"</p>
<p>Harry returned a steady look. "My parents are alive and well,
and they always refused to talk about how my <em>genetic</em>
parents died. From which I infer that it wasn't good."</p>
<p>"An admirable loyalty," said Professor McGonagall. Her voice
went low. "Though it hurts a little to hear you say it like that.
Lily and James were friends of mine."</p>
<p>Harry looked away, suddenly ashamed. "I'm sorry," he said in a
small voice. "But I <em>have</em> a Mum and Dad. And I know that
I'd just make myself unhappy by comparing that reality to...
something perfect that I built up in my imagination."</p>
<p>"That is amazingly wise of you," Professor McGonagall said
quietly. "But your <em>genetic</em> parents died very well indeed,
protecting you."</p>
<p><em>Protecting me?</em></p>
<p>Something strange clutched at Harry's heart. "What...
<em>did</em> happen?"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall sighed. Her wand tapped Harry's forehead,
and his vision blurred for a moment. "Something of a disguise," she
said, "so that this doesn't happen again, not until you're ready."
Then her wand licked out again, and tapped three times on a brick
wall...</p>
<p>...which hollowed into a hole, and dilated and expanded and
shivered into a huge archway, revealing a long row of shops with
signs advertising cauldrons and dragon livers.</p>
<p>Harry didn't blink. It wasn't like anyone was turning into a
cat.</p>
<p>And they walked forwards, together, into the wizarding
world.</p>
<p>There were merchants hawking Bounce Boots ("Made with real
Flubber!") and "Knives +3! Forks +2! Spoons with a +4 bonus!" There
were goggles that would turn anything you looked at green, and a
lineup of comfy armchairs with ejection seats for emergencies.</p>
<p>Harry's head kept rotating, rotating like it was trying to wind
itself off his neck. It was like walking through the magical items
section of an <em>Advanced Dungeons and Dragons</em> rulebook (he
didn't play the game, but he did enjoy reading the rulebooks).
Harry desperately didn't want to miss a single item for sale, in
case it was one of the three you needed to complete the cycle of
infinite <em>wish</em> spells.</p>
<p>Then Harry spotted something that made him, entirely without
thinking, veer off from the Deputy Headmistress and start heading
straight into the shop, a front of blue bricks with bronze-metal
trim. He was brought back to reality only when Professor McGonagall
stepped right in front of him.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter?" she said.</p>
<p>Harry blinked, then realised what he'd just done. "I'm sorry! I
forgot for a moment that I was with you instead of my family."
Harry gestured at the shop window, which displayed fiery letters
that shone piercingly bright and yet remote, spelling out
<em>Bigbam's Brilliant Books</em>. "When you walk past a bookshop
you haven't visited before, you have to go in and look around.
That's the family rule."</p>
<p>"That is the most Ravenclaw thing I have ever heard."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Nothing. Mr. Potter, our first step is to visit Gringotts, the
bank of the wizarding world. Your <em>genetic</em> family vault is
there, with the inheritance your <em>genetic</em> parents left you,
and you'll need money for school supplies." She sighed. "And, I
suppose, a certain amount of spending money for books could be
excused as well. Though you might want to hold off for a time.
Hogwarts has quite a large library on magical subjects. And the
tower in which, I strongly suspect, you will be living, has a more
broad-ranging library of its own. Any book you bought now would
probably be a duplicate."</p>
<p>Harry nodded, and they walked on.</p>
<p>"Don't get me wrong, it's a <em>great</em> distraction," Harry
said as his head kept swivelling, "probably the best distraction
anyone has ever tried on me, but don't think I've forgotten about
our pending discussion."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall sighed. "Your parents - or your mother at
any rate - may have been very wise not to tell you."</p>
<p>"So you wish that I could continue in blissful ignorance? There
is a certain flaw in that plan, Professor McGonagall."</p>
<p>"I suppose it would be rather pointless," the witch said
tightly, "when anyone on the street could tell you the story. Very
well."</p>
<p>And she told him of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, the Dark Lord,
Voldemort.</p>
<p>"Voldemort?" Harry whispered. It should have been funny, but it
wasn't. The name burned with a cold feeling, ruthlessness, diamond
clarity, a hammer of pure titanium descending upon an anvil of
yielding flesh. A chill swept over Harry even as he pronounced the
word, and he resolved then and there to use safer terms like
You-Know-Who.</p>
<p>The Dark Lord had raged upon wizarding Britain like a wilding
wolf, tearing and rending at the fabric of their everyday lives.
Other countries had wrung their hands but hesitated to intervene,
whether out of apathetic selfishness or simple fear, for whichever
was first among them to oppose the Dark Lord, their peace would be
the next target of his terror.</p>
<p>(<em>The bystander effect,</em> thought Harry, thinking of
Latane and Darley's experiment which had shown that you were more
likely to get help if you had an epileptic fit in front of one
person than in front of three. <em>Diffusion of responsibility,
everyone hoping that someone else would go first.</em>)</p>
<p>The Death Eaters had followed in the Dark Lord's wake and in his
vanguard, carrion vultures to pick at wounds, or snakes to bite and
weaken. The Death Eaters were not as terrible as the Dark Lord, but
they were terrible, and they were many. And the Death Eaters
wielded more than wands; there was wealth within those masked
ranks, and political power, and secrets held in blackmail, to
paralyse a society trying to protect itself.</p>
<p>An old and respected journalist, Yermy Wibble, called for
increased taxes and conscription. He shouted that it was absurd for
the many to cower in fear of the few. His skin, only his skin, had
been found nailed to the newsroom wall that next morning, next to
the skins of his wife and two daughters. Everyone wished for
something more to be done, and no one dared take the lead to
propose it. Whoever stood out the most became the next example.</p>
<p>Until the names of James and Lily Potter rose to the top of that
list.</p>
<p>And those two might have died with their wands in their hands
and not regretted their choices, for they <em>were</em> heroes; but
for that they had an infant child, their son, Harry Potter.</p>
<p>Tears were coming into Harry's eyes. He wiped them away in anger
or maybe desperation, <em>I didn't know those people, not really,
they aren't my parents</em> now, <em>it would be pointless to feel
so sad for them -</em></p>
<p>When Harry was done sobbing into the witch's robes, he looked
up, and felt a little bit better to see tears in Professor
McGonagall's eyes as well.</p>
<p>"So what happened?" Harry said, his voice trembling.</p>
<p>"The Dark Lord came to Godric's Hollow," Professor McGonagall
said in a whisper. "You should have been hidden, but you were
betrayed. The Dark Lord killed James, and he killed Lily, and he
came in the end to you, to your cot. He cast the Killing Curse at
you, and that was where it ended. The Killing Curse is formed of
pure hate, and strikes directly at the soul, severing it from the
body. It cannot be blocked, and whomever it strikes, they die. But
you survived. You are the only person ever to survive. The Killing
Curse rebounded and struck the Dark Lord, leaving only the burnt
hulk of his body and a scar upon your forehead. That was the end of
the terror, and we were free. That, Harry Potter, is why people
want to see the scar on your forehead, and why they want to shake
your hand."</p>
<p>The storm of weeping that had washed through Harry had used up
all his tears; he could not cry again, he was done.</p>
<p>(And somewhere in the back of his mind was a small, small note
of confusion, a sense of something wrong about that story; and it
should have been a part of Harry's art to notice that tiny note,
but he was distracted. For it is a sad rule that whenever you are
most in need of your art as a rationalist, that is when you are
most likely to forget it.)</p>
<p>Harry detached himself from Professor McGonagall's side. "I'll -
have to think about this," he said, trying to keep his voice under
control. He stared at his shoes. "Um. You can go ahead and call
them my parents, if you want, you don't have to say 'genetic
parents' or anything. I guess there's no reason I can't have two
mothers and two fathers."</p>
<p>There was no sound from Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>And they walked together in silence, until they came before a
great white building with vast bronze doors, and carven words above
saying <em>Gringotts Bank.</em></p>

<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The Moke Shop was a quaint little shop (some might even say
cute) ensconced behind a vegetable stall that was behind a magical
glove shop that was on an alleyway off a side street of Diagon
Alley. Disappointingly, the shopkeeper was not a wizened ancient
crone; just a nervous-looking young woman wearing faded yellow
robes. Right now she was holding out a Moke Super Pouch QX31, whose
selling point was that it had a Widening Lip as well as an
Undetectable Extension Charm: you could actually fit big things in
it, though the total volume was still limited.</p>
<p>Harry had <em>insisted</em> on coming here straight away, first
thing - insisted as hard as he thought he could without making
Professor McGonagall suspicious. Harry had something he needed to
put into the pouch as soon as possible. It wasn't the bag of
Galleons that Professor McGonagall had allowed him to withdraw from
Gringotts. It was all the other Galleons that Harry had
surreptitiously shoved into his pocket after falling into a heap of
gold coins. That <em>had</em> been a real accident, but Harry was
never one to discard an opportunity... though it'd really been more
of a spur-of-the-moment thing. Ever since Harry had been awkwardly
carrying the allowed bag of Galleons next to his trouser pocket, so
that any jingling would seem to come from the right place.</p>
<p>This still left the question of how he was actually going to get
the <em>other</em> coins into the pouch without getting caught. The
golden coins might have been his, but they were still stolen -
self-stolen? Auto-thieved?</p>
<p>Harry looked up from the Moke Super Pouch QX31 on the counter in
front of him. "Can I try this for a bit? To make sure it works, um,
reliably?" He widened his eyes in an expression of boyish, playful
innocence.</p>
<p>Sure enough, after ten repetitions of putting the coin-bag into
the pouch, reaching in, whispering "bag of gold", and taking it
out, Professor McGonagall took a step away and began examining some
of the other items in the shop, and the shopkeeper turned her head
to watch.</p>
<p>Harry dropped the bag of gold into the mokeskin pouch with his
<em>left</em> hand; his <em>right</em> hand came out of his pocket
tightly holding some of the gold coins, reached into the mokeskin
pouch, dropped the loose Galleons, and (with a whisper of "bag of
gold") retrieved the original bag. Then the bag went back into his
<em>left</em> hand, to be dropped in again, and Harry's
<em>right</em> hand went back into his pocket...</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall looked back at him once, but Harry managed
to avoid freezing or flinching, and she didn't seem to notice
anything. Though you never <em>did</em> quite know, with the adults
that had a sense of humour. It took three iterations to get the job
done, and Harry guessed he'd managed to steal maybe thirty Galleons
from himself.</p>
<p>Harry reached up, wiped a bit of sweat from his forehead, and
exhaled. "I'd like this one, please."</p>
<p>Fifteen Galleons lighter (twice the price of a wizard's wand,
apparently) and one Moke Super Pouch QX31 heavier, Harry and
Professor McGonagall pushed their way out of the door. The door
formed a hand and waved goodbye to them as they left, extruding its
arm in a way that made Harry feel a bit queasy.</p>
<p>And then, unfortunately...</p>
<p>"Are you <em>really</em> Harry Potter?" whispered the old man,
one huge tear sliding down his cheek. "You wouldn't lie about that,
would you? Only I'd heard rumours that you didn't <em>really</em>
survive the Killing Curse and that's why no one ever heard from you
again."</p>
<p>...it seemed that Professor McGonagall's disguise spell was less
than perfectly effective against more experienced magical
practitioners.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall had laid a hand on Harry's shoulder and
yanked him into the nearest alleyway the moment she'd heard "Harry
Potter?" The old man had followed, but at least it looked like no
one else had heard.</p>
<p>Harry considered the question. <em>Was</em> he really Harry
Potter? "I only know what other people have told me," Harry said.
"It's not like I remember being born." His hand brushed his
forehead. "I've had this scar as long as I remember, and I've been
told my name was Harry Potter as long as I remember. But," Harry
said thoughtfully, "if there's already sufficient cause to
postulate a conspiracy, there's no reason why they wouldn't just
find another orphan and raise him to believe that <em>he</em> was
Harry Potter -"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall drew her hand over her face in
exasperation. "You look just about exactly like your father, James,
the year he first attended Hogwarts. And I can attest on the basis
of <em>personality alone</em> that you are related to the Scourge
of Gryffindor."</p>
<p>"<em>She</em> could be in on it too," Harry observed.</p>
<p>"No," quavered the old man. "She's right. You have your mother's
eyes."</p>
<p>"Hmm," Harry frowned. "I suppose <em>you</em> could be in on it
too -"</p>
<p>"Enough, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>The old man raised up a hand as if to touch Harry, but then let
it fall. "I'm just glad that you're alive," he murmured. "Thank
you, Harry Potter. Thank you for what you did... I'll leave you
alone now."</p>
<p>And his cane slowly tapped away, out the alley and down the main
street of Diagon Alley.</p>
<p>The Professor looked around, her expression tense and grim.
Harry automatically looked around himself. But the alley seemed
empty of all but old leaves, and from the mouth leading out into
Diagon Alley, only swiftly striding passersby could be seen.</p>
<p>Finally Professor McGonagall seemed to relax. "That was not well
done," she said in a low voice. "I know you're not used to this,
Mr. Potter, but people do care about you. Please be kind to
them."</p>
<p>Harry looked down at his shoes. "They shouldn't," he said with a
tinge of bitterness. "Care about me, I mean."</p>
<p>"You saved them from You-Know-Who," said Professor McGonagall.
"How should they not care?"</p>
<p>Harry looked up at the witch-lady's strict expression beneath
her pointed hat, and sighed. "I suppose there's no chance that if I
said <em>fundamental attribution error</em> you'd have any idea
what that meant."</p>
<p>"No," said the Professor in her precise Scottish accent, "but
please explain, Mr. Potter, if you would be so kind."</p>
<p>"Well..." Harry said, trying to figure out how to describe that
particular bit of Muggle science. "Suppose you come into work and
see your colleague kicking his desk. You think, 'what an angry
person he must be'. Your colleague is thinking about how someone
bumped him into a wall on the way to work and then shouted at him.
<em>Anyone</em> would be angry at that, he thinks. When we look at
others we see personality traits that explain their behaviour, but
when we look at ourselves we see circumstances that explain our
behaviour. People's stories make internal sense to them, from the
inside, but we don't see people's histories trailing behind them in
the air. We only see them in one situation, and we don't see what
they would be like in a different situation. So the fundamental
attribution error is that we explain by permanent, enduring traits
what would be better explained by circumstance and context." There
were some elegant experiments which confirmed this, but Harry
wasn't about to go into them.</p>
<p>The witch's eyebrows drew up beneath her hat's brim. "I think I
understand..." Professor McGonagall said slowly. "But what does
that have to do with you?"</p>
<p>Harry kicked the brick wall of the alley hard enough to make his
foot hurt. "People think that I saved them from You-Know-Who
because I'm some kind of great warrior of the Light."</p>
<p>"The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord..." murmured
the witch, a strange irony leavening her voice.</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said, annoyance and frustration warring in him,
"like I destroyed the Dark Lord because I have some kind of
permanent, enduring destroy-the-Dark-Lord trait. I was fifteen
months old at the time! I don't <em>know</em> what happened, but I
would <em>suppose</em> it had something to do with, as the saying
goes, contingent environmental circumstances. And certainly nothing
to do with my personality. People don't care about <em>me,</em>
they aren't even paying attention to <em>me,</em> they want to
shake hands with a <em>bad explanation</em>." Harry paused, and
looked at McGonagall. "Do <em>you</em> know what really
happened?"</p>
<p>"I <em>have</em> formed an idea..." said Professor McGonagall.
"After meeting you, that is."</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"You triumphed over the Dark Lord by being more awful than
<em>he</em> was, and survived the Killing Curse by being more
terrible than Death."</p>
<p>"Ha. Ha. Ha." Harry kicked the wall again.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall chuckled. "Let's get you to Madam Malkin's
next. I fear your Muggle clothing may be attracting attention."</p>
<p>They ran into two more well-wishers along the way.</p>
<p>Madam Malkin's Robes had a genuinely boring shopfront, red
ordinary brick, and glass windows showing plain black robes within.
Not robes that shone or changed or spun, or radiated strange rays
that seemed to go right through your shirt and tickle you. Just
plain black robes, that was all you could see through the window.
The door was propped wide open, as if to advertise that there were
no secrets here and nothing to hide.</p>
<p>"I'm going to go off for a few minutes while you get fitted for
your robes," said Professor McGonagall. "Will you be all right with
that, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>Harry nodded. He hated clothes shopping with a fiery passion and
couldn't blame the older witch for feeling the same way.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall's wand came out of her sleeve, tapped
Harry's head lightly. "And as you'll need to be clear to Madam
Malkin's senses, I am removing the Obfuscation."</p>
<p>"Uh..." Harry said. That did worry him a little; he still wasn't
used to the 'Harry Potter' thing.</p>
<p>"I went to Hogwarts with Madam Malkin," McGonagall said. "Even
then, she was one of the most <em>composed</em> people I knew. She
wouldn't turn a hair if You-Know-Who himself walked into her shop."
McGonagall's voice was reminiscent, and very approving. "Madam
Malkin won't bother you, and she won't let anyone else bother
you."</p>
<p>"Where <em>are</em> you going?" Harry inquired. "Just in case,
you know, something <em>does</em> happen."</p>
<p>McGonagall gave Harry a hard look. "I am going <em>there,</em>"
she said, pointing at a building across the street which showed the
sign of a wooden keg, "and buying a drink, which I desperately
need. <em>You</em> are to get fitted for your robes, <em>nothing
else</em>. I will come back to check up on you <em>shortly</em>,
and I <em>expect</em> to find Madam Malkin's shop still standing
and not in any way on fire."</p>
<p>Madam Malkin was a bustling old woman who didn't say a word
about Harry when she saw the scar on his forehead, and she shot a
sharp look at an assistant when that girl seemed about to say
something. Madam Malkin got out a set of animated, writhing bits of
cloth that seemed to serve as tape measures and set to work
examining the medium of her art.</p>
<p>Next to Harry, a pale young boy with a pointed face and
<em>awesomecool</em> blonde-white hair seemed to be going through
the final stages of a similar process. One of Malkin's two
assistants was examining the white-haired boy and the
chequerboard-gridded robe he was wearing; occasionally she would
tap a corner of the robe with her wand, and the robe would loosen
or tighten.</p>
<p>"Hello," said the boy. "Hogwarts, too?"</p>
<p>Harry could predict where this conversation was about to go, and
he decided in a split second of frustration that enough was
enough.</p>
<p>"Good heavens," whispered Harry, "it couldn't be." He let his
eyes widen. "Your... name, sir?"</p>
<p>"Draco Malfoy," said Draco Malfoy, looking slightly puzzled.</p>
<p>"It <em>is</em> you! Draco Malfoy. I - I never thought I'd be so
honoured, sir." Harry wished he could make tears come out of his
eyes. The others usually started crying at around this point.</p>
<p>"Oh," said Draco, sounding a little confused. Then his lips
stretched in a smug smile. "It's good to meet someone who knows his
place."</p>
<p>One of the assistants, the one who'd seemed to recognise Harry,
made a muffled choking sound.</p>
<p>Harry burbled on. "I'm delighted to meet you, Mr. Malfoy. Just
unutterably delighted. And to be attending Hogwarts in your very
year! It makes my heart swoon."</p>
<p>Oops. That last part might have sounded a little odd, like he
was flirting with Draco or something.</p>
<p>"And <em>I</em> am pleased to learn that I shall be treated with
the respect due to the family of Malfoy," the other boy lobbed
back, accompanied by a smile such as the highest of kings might
bestow upon the least of his subjects, if that subject were honest,
though poor.</p>
<p>Eh... Damn, Harry was having trouble thinking up his next line.
Well, everyone <em>did</em> want to shake the hand of Harry Potter,
so - "When my clothes are fitted, sir, might you deign to shake my
hand? I should wish nothing more to put the capper upon this day,
nay, this month, indeed, my whole lifetime."</p>
<p>The white-blonde-haired boy glared in return. "And what have
<em>you</em> done for the Malfoys that entitles you to such a
favour?"</p>
<p><em>Oh, I am so totally trying this routine on the next person
who wants to shake my hand.</em> Harry bowed his head. "No, no,
sir, I understand. I'm sorry for asking. I should be honoured to
clean your boots, rather."</p>
<p>"Indeed," snapped the other boy. His stern face lightened
somewhat. "Tell me, what House do you think you might be sorted
into? I'm bound for Slytherin House, of course, like my father
Lucius before me. And for you, I'd guess House Hufflepuff, or
possibly House Elf."</p>
<p>Harry grinned sheepishly. "Professor McGonagall says that I'm
the most Ravenclaw person she's ever seen or heard tell of in
legend, so much so that Rowena herself would tell me to get out
more, whatever <em>that</em> means, and that I'll undoubtedly end
up in Ravenclaw House if the hat isn't screaming too loudly for the
rest of us to make out any words, end quote."</p>
<p>"Wow," said Draco Malfoy, sounding slightly impressed. The boy
gave a sort of wistful sigh. "Your flattery was great, or I thought
so, anyway - you'd do well in Slytherin House, too. Usually it's
only my father who gets that sort of grovelling. I'm
<em>hoping</em> the other Slytherins will suck up to me now I'm at
Hogwarts... I guess this is a good sign, then."</p>
<p>Harry coughed. "Actually, sorry, I've got no idea who you are
really."</p>
<p>"<em>Oh come on!</em> " the boy said with fierce disappointment.
"Why'd you go and do that, then?" Draco's eyes widened with sudden
suspicion. "And how do you <em>not</em> know about the Malfoys? And
what are those <em>clothes</em> you're wearing? Are your parents
<em>Muggles?</em> "</p>
<p>"Two of my parents are dead," Harry said. His heart twinged.
When he put it that way - "My other two parents are Muggles, and
they're the ones that raised me."</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " said Draco. "Who <em>are</em> you?"</p>
<p>"Harry Potter, pleased to meet you."</p>
<p>"<em>Harry Potter?</em> " gasped Draco. "<em>The</em> Harry -"
and the boy cut off abruptly.</p>
<p>There was a brief silence.</p>
<p>Then, with bright enthusiasm, "Harry Potter? <em>The</em> Harry
Potter? Gosh, I've always wanted to meet you!"</p>
<p>Draco's attendant emitted a sound like she was strangling but
kept on with her work, lifting Draco's arms to carefully remove the
chequered robe.</p>
<p>"Shut up," Harry suggested.</p>
<p>"Can I have your autograph? No, wait, I want a picture with you
first!"</p>
<p>"Shut<em>up</em>shut<em>up</em>shut<em>up.</em>"</p>
<p>"I'm just so <em>delighted</em> to meet you!"</p>
<p>"Burst into flames and die."</p>
<p>"But you're Harry Potter, the glorious saviour of the wizarding
world! Everyone's hero, Harry Potter! I've always wanted to be just
like you when I grow up so I can -"</p>
<p>Draco cut off the words in mid-sentence, his face freezing in
absolute horror.</p>
<p>Tall, white-haired, coldly elegant in black robes of the finest
quality. One hand gripping a silver-handled cane which took on the
character of a deadly weapon just by being in that hand. His eyes
regarded the room with the dispassionate quality of an executioner,
a man to whom killing was not painful, or even deliciously
forbidden, but just a routine activity like breathing.</p>
<p>That was the man who had, just that moment, strolled in through
the open door.</p>
<p>"Draco," said the man, low and very angry, "<em>what</em> are
you <em>saying?</em> "</p>
<p>In one split second of sympathetic panic, Harry formulated a
rescue plan.</p>
<p>"Lucius Malfoy!" gasped Harry Potter. "<em>The</em> Lucius
Malfoy?"</p>
<p>One of Malkin's assistants had to turn away and face the
wall.</p>
<p>Coolly murderous eyes regarded him. "Harry Potter."</p>
<p>"I am so, so honoured to meet you!"</p>
<p>The dark eyes widened, shocked surprise replacing deadly
threat.</p>
<p>"Your son has been telling me <em>all</em> about you," Harry
gushed on, hardly even knowing what was coming out of his mouth but
just talking as fast as possible. "But of course I knew about you
all before then, everyone knows about you, the great Lucius Malfoy!
The most honoured laureate of all the House of Slytherin, I've been
thinking about trying to get into Slytherin House myself just
because I heard you were in it as a child -"</p>
<p>"<em>What are you saying, Mr. Potter?</em> " came a near-scream
from outside the shop, and Professor McGonagall burst in a second
later.</p>
<p>There was such pure horror on her face that Harry's mouth opened
automatically, and then blocked on nothing-to-say.</p>
<p>"Professor McGonagall!" cried Draco. "Is it really you? I've
heard so much about you from my father, I've been thinking of
trying to get Sorted into Gryffindor so I can -"</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " bellowed Lucius Malfoy and Professor
McGonagall in perfect unison, standing side-by-side. Their heads
swivelled to look at each other in duplicate motions, and then the
two recoiled from one another as though performing a synchronised
dance.</p>
<p>There was a sudden flurry of action as Lucius seized Draco and
dragged him out of the shop.</p>
<p>And then there was silence.</p>
<p>In Professor McGonagall's left hand lay a small drinking-glass,
tilted over to one side in the forgotten rush, now slowly dripping
drops of alcohol into the tiny puddle of red wine that had appeared
on the floor.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall strode forward into the shop until she was
opposite Madam Malkin.</p>
<p>"Madam Malkin," said Professor McGonagall, her voice calm. "What
has been happening here?"</p>
<p>Madam Malkin looked back silently for four seconds, and then
cracked up. She fell against the wall, wheezing out laughter, and
that set off both of her assistants, one of whom fell to her hands
and knees on the floor, giggling hysterically.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall slowly turned to look at Harry, her
expression chilly. "I leave you alone for six minutes. Six minutes,
Mr. Potter, by the very clock."</p>
<p>"I was only joking around," Harry protested, as the sounds of
hysterical laughter went on nearby.</p>
<p>"<em>Draco Malfoy said in front of his father that he wanted to
be sorted into Gryffindor!</em> Joking around <em>isn't enough</em>
to <em>do</em> that!" Professor McGonagall paused, visibly taking
breaths. "What part of 'get fitted for robes' sounded to you like
<em>please cast a Confundus Charm on the entire
universe!</em> "</p>
<p>"He was in a situational context where those actions made
internal sense -"</p>
<p>"No. Don't explain. I don't want to know what happened in here,
ever. Whatever dark power inhabits you, it is <em>contagious,</em>
and I don't want to end up like poor Draco Malfoy, poor Madam
Malkin and her two poor assistants."</p>
<p>Harry sighed. It was clear that Professor McGonagall wasn't in a
mood to listen to reasonable explanations. He looked at Madam
Malkin, who was still wheezing against the wall, and Malkin's two
assistants, who had now <em>both</em> fallen to their knees, and
finally down at his own tape-measure-draped body.</p>
<p>"I'm not quite done being fitted for clothes," Harry said
kindly. "Why don't you go back and have another drink?"</p>

Hypothesis<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>Disclaimer: J. K. Rowling is watching you from where she waits,
eternally in the void between worlds.</p>
<p>A/N: As others have noted, the novels seem inconsistent in the
apparent purchasing power of a Galleon; I'm picking a consistent
value and sticking with it. Five pounds sterling to the Galleon
doesn't square with seven Galleons for a wand and children using
hand-me-down wands.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"<em>World domination is such an ugly phrase. I prefer to call
it world optimisation.</em>"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Heaps of gold Galleons. Stacks of silver Sickles. Piles of
bronze Knuts.</p>
<p>Harry stood there, and stared with his mouth open at the family
vault. He had so many questions he didn't know <em>where</em> to
start.</p>
<p>From just outside the door of the vault, Professor McGonagall
watched him, seeming to lean casually against the wall, but her
eyes intent. Well, that made sense. Being plopped in front of a
giant heap of gold coins was a test of character so pure it was
archetypal.</p>
<p>"Are these coins the pure metal?" Harry said finally.</p>
<p>"What?" hissed the goblin Griphook, who was waiting near the
door. "Are you questioning the integrity of Gringotts, Mr.
Potter-Evans-Verres?"</p>
<p>"No," said Harry absently, "not at all, sorry if that came out
wrong, sir. I just have no idea at all how your financial system
works. I'm asking if Galleons in general are made of pure
gold."</p>
<p>"Of course," said Griphook.</p>
<p>"And can anyone coin them, or are they issued by a monopoly that
thereby collects seigniorage?"</p>
<p>"What?" said Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>Griphook grinned, showing sharp teeth. "Only a fool would trust
any but goblin coin!"</p>
<p>"In other words," Harry said, "the coins aren't supposed to be
worth any more than the metal making them up?"</p>
<p>Griphook stared at Harry. Professor McGonagall looked
bemused.</p>
<p>"I mean, suppose I came in here with a ton of silver. Could I
get a ton of Sickles made from it?"</p>
<p>"For a fee, Mr. Potter-Evans-Verres." The goblin watched him
with glittering eyes. "For a certain fee. Where would you find a
ton of silver, I wonder?"</p>
<p>"I was speaking hypothetically," Harry said. <em>For now, at any
rate.</em> "So... how much would you charge in fees, as a fraction
of the whole weight?"</p>
<p>Griphook's eyes were intent. "I would have to consult my
superiors..."</p>
<p>"Give me a wild guess. I won't hold Gringotts to it."</p>
<p>"A twentieth part of the metal would well pay for the
coining."</p>
<p>Harry nodded. "Thank you very much, Mr. Griphook."</p>
<p><em>So not only is the wizarding economy almost completely
decoupled from the Muggle economy, no one here has ever heard of
arbitrage.</em> The larger Muggle economy had a fluctuating trading
range of gold to silver, so every time the Muggle gold-to-silver
ratio got more than 5% away from the weight of seventeen Sickles to
one Galleon, either gold or silver should have drained from the
wizarding economy until it became impossible to maintain the
exchange rate. Bring in a ton of silver, change to Sickles (and pay
5%), change the Sickles for Galleons, take the gold to the Muggle
world, exchange it for more silver than you started with, and
repeat.</p>
<p>Wasn't the Muggle gold to silver ratio somewhere around fifty to
one? Harry didn't think it was seventeen, anyway. And it looked
like the silver coins were actually <em>smaller</em> than the gold
coins.</p>
<p>Then again, Harry was standing in a bank that <em>literally</em>
stored your money in vaults full of gold coins guarded by dragons,
where you had to go in and take coins out of your vault whenever
you wanted to spend money. The finer points of arbitraging away
market inefficiencies might well be lost on them. He'd been tempted
to make snide remarks about the crudity of their financial
system...</p>
<p><em>But the sad thing is, their way is probably better.</em></p>
<p>On the other hand, one competent hedge fundie could probably own
the whole wizarding world within a week. Harry filed away this
notion in case he ever ran out of money, or had a week free.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the giant heaps of gold coins within the Potter vault
ought to suit his near-term requirements.</p>
<p>Harry stumped forward, and began picking up gold coins with one
hand and dumping them into the other.</p>
<p>When he had reached twenty, Professor McGonagall coughed. "I
think that will be more than enough to pay for your school
supplies, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>"Hm?" Harry said, his mind elsewhere. "Hold on, I'm doing a
Fermi calculation."</p>
<p>"A <em>what?</em> " said Professor McGonagall, sounding somewhat
alarmed.</p>
<p>"It's a mathematical thing. Named after Enrico Fermi. A way of
getting rough numbers quickly in your head..."</p>
<p>Twenty gold Galleons weighed a tenth of a kilogram, maybe? And
gold was, what, ten thousand British pounds a kilogram? So a
Galleon would be worth about fifty pounds... The mounds of gold
coins looked to be about sixty coins high and twenty coins wide in
either dimension of the base, and a mound was pyramidal, so it
would be around one-third of the cube. Eight thousand Galleons per
mound, roughly, and there were around five mounds of that size, so
forty thousand Galleons or 2 million pounds sterling.</p>
<p>Not bad. Harry smiled with a certain grim satisfaction. It was
too bad that he was right in the middle of discovering the amazing
new world of magic, and couldn't take time out to explore the
amazing new world of being rich, which a quick Fermi estimate said
was roughly a billion times less interesting.</p>
<p><em>Still, that's the last time I ever mow a lawn for one lousy
pound.</em></p>
<p>Harry wheeled from the giant heap of money. "Pardon me for
asking, Professor McGonagall, but I understand that my parents were
in their twenties when they died. Is this a <em>usual</em> amount
of money for a young couple to have in their vault, in the
wizarding world?" If it was, a cup of tea probably cost five
thousand pounds. Rule one of economics: you can't eat money.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall shook her head. "Your father was the last
heir of an old family, Mr. Potter. It's also possible..." The witch
hesitated. "Some of this money may be from bounties placed on
You-Know-Who, payable to his ki- ah, to whoever might defeat him.
Or those bounties might not have been collected yet. I am not
sure."</p>
<p>"Interesting..." Harry said slowly. "So some of this really is,
in a sense, mine. That is, earned by me. Sort of. Possibly. Even if
I don't remember the occasion." Harry's fingers tapped against his
trouser-leg. "That makes me feel less guilty about spending <em>a
very tiny fraction of it! Don't panic, Professor
McGonagall!</em> "</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter! You are a minor, and as such, you will only be
allowed to make <em>reasonable</em> withdrawals from -"</p>
<p>"I am <em>all about</em> reasonable! I am totally on board with
fiscal prudence and impulse control! But I <em>did</em> see some
things on the way here which would constitute <em>sensible,
grown-up</em> purchases..."</p>
<p>Harry locked gazes with Professor McGonagall, engaging in a
silent staring contest.</p>
<p>"Like what?" Professor McGonagall said finally.</p>
<p>"Trunks whose insides hold more than their outsides?"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall's face grew stern. "Those are <em>very</em>
expensive, Mr. Potter!"</p>
<p>"Yes, but -" Harry pleaded. "I'm sure that when I'm an adult
I'll want one. And I <em>can</em> afford one. Logically, it would
make just as much sense to buy it now instead of later, and get the
use of it right away. It's the same money either way, right? I
mean, I <em>would</em> want a good one, with <em>lots</em> of room
inside, good enough that I wouldn't have to just get a better one
later..." Harry trailed off hopefully.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall's gaze didn't waver. "And just what would
you <em>keep</em> in a trunk like that, Mr. Potter -"</p>
<p>"Books."</p>
<p>"Of course," sighed Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>"You should have told me <em>much earlier</em> that sort of
magic item existed! And that I could afford one! Now my father and
I are going to have to spend the next two days <em>frantically</em>
hitting up all the secondhand bookshops for old textbooks, so I can
have a decent science library with me at Hogwarts - and maybe a
small science fiction collection, if I can assemble something
decent out of the bargain bins. Or better yet, I'll make the deal a
little sweeter for you, okay? Just let me buy -"</p>
<p>"<em>Mr. Potter!</em> You think you can <em>bribe</em> me?"</p>
<p>"What? <em>No!</em> Not like that! I'm saying, Hogwarts can keep
some of the books I bring, if you think that any of them would make
good additions to the library. I'm going to be getting them cheap,
and <em>I</em> just want to have them around somewhere or other.
It's okay to bribe people with <em>books,</em> right? That's a
-"</p>
<p>"Family tradition."</p>
<p>"Yes, exactly."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall's body seemed to slump, the shoulders
lowering within her black robes. "I cannot deny the sense of your
words, though I much wish I could. I will allow you to withdraw an
additional hundred Galleons, Mr. Potter." She sighed again. "I
<em>know</em> that I shall regret this, and I am doing it
anyway."</p>
<p>"That's the spirit! And does a 'mokeskin pouch' do what I think
it does?"</p>
<p>"It can't do as much as a trunk," the witch said with visible
reluctance, "but... a mokeskin pouch with a Retrieval Charm and
Undetectable Extension Charm can hold a number of items until they
are called forth by the one who emplaced them -"</p>
<p>"Yes! I definitely need one of those too! It would be like the
super beltpack of ultimate awesomeness! Batman's utility belt of
holding! Never mind my swiss army knife, I could carry a whole tool
set in there! Or <em>books!</em> I could have the top three books I
was reading on me at all times, and just pull one out anywhere!
I'll never have to waste another minute of my life! What do you
say, Professor McGonagall? It's for the sake of children's reading,
the best of all possible causes."</p>
<p>"...I suppose you may add another ten Galleons."</p>
<p>Griphook was favouring Harry with a gaze of frank respect,
possibly even outright admiration.</p>
<p>"And a little spending money, like you mentioned earlier. I
think I can remember seeing one or two other things I might want to
store in that pouch."</p>
<p>"<em>Don't push it, Mr. Potter.</em>"</p>
<p>"But oh, Professor McGonagall, why rain on my parade? Surely
this is a <em>happy</em> day, when I discover all things wizarding
for the first time! Why act the part of the grumpy grownup when
instead you could smile and remember your own innocent childhood,
watching the look of delight upon my young face as I buy a few toys
using an insignificant fraction of the wealth that I earned by
defeating the most terrible wizard Britain has ever known, not that
I'm accusing you of being ungrateful or anything, but still, what
are a few toys compared to that?"</p>
<p>"<em>You,</em>" growled Professor McGonagall. There was a look
on her face so fearsome and terrible that Harry squeaked and
stepped back, knocking over a pile of gold coins with a great
jingling noise and sprawling backwards into a heap of money.
Griphook sighed and put a palm over his face. "I would be doing a
great service to wizarding Britain, Mr. Potter, if I locked you in
this vault and left you here."</p>
<p>And they left without any more trouble.</p>

<p><em>"Of course it was my fault. There's no one else here who
could be responsible for anything."</em></p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"Now, just to be clear," Harry said, "if the professor does
levitate you, Dad, when you know you haven't been attached to any
wires, that's going to be sufficient evidence. You're not going to
turn around and say that it's a magician's trick. That wouldn't be
fair play. If you feel that way, you should say so <em>now</em>,
and we can figure out a different experiment instead."</p>
<p>Harry's father, Professor Michael Verres-Evans, rolled his eyes.
"Yes, Harry."</p>
<p>"And you, Mum, your theory says that the professor should be
able to do this, and if that doesn't happen, you'll admit you're
mistaken. Nothing about how magic doesn't work when people are
sceptical of it, or anything like that."</p>
<p>Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall was watching Harry with a
bemused expression. She looked quite witchy in her black robes and
pointed hat, but when she spoke she sounded formal and Scottish,
which didn't go together with the look at all. At first glance she
looked like someone who ought to cackle and put babies into
cauldrons, but the whole effect was ruined as soon as she opened
her mouth. "Is that sufficient, Mr. Potter?" she said. "Shall I go
ahead and demonstrate?"</p>
<p>"<em>Sufficient?</em> Probably not," Harry said. "But at least
it will <em>help.</em> Go ahead, Deputy Headmistress."</p>
<p>"Just Professor will do," said she, and then, "<em>Wingardium
Leviosa</em>."</p>
<p>Harry looked at his father.</p>
<p>"Huh," Harry said.</p>
<p>His father looked back at him. "Huh," his father echoed.</p>
<p>Then Professor Verres-Evans looked back at Professor McGonagall.
"All right, you can put me down now."</p>
<p>His father was lowered carefully to the ground.</p>
<p>Harry ruffled a hand through his own hair. Maybe it was just
that strange part of him which had <em>already</em> been convinced,
but... "That's a bit of an anticlimax," Harry said. "You'd think
there'd be some kind of more dramatic mental event associated with
updating on an observation of infinitesimal probability -" Harry
stopped himself. Mum, the witch, and even his Dad were giving him
<em>that look</em> again. "I mean, with finding out that everything
I believe is false."</p>
<p>Seriously, it should have been more dramatic. His brain ought to
have been flushing its entire current stock of hypotheses about the
universe, none of which allowed this to happen. But instead his
brain just seemed to be going, <em>All right, I saw the Hogwarts
Professor wave her wand and make your father rise into the air, now
what?</em></p>
<p>The witch-lady was smiling benevolently upon them, looking quite
amused. "Would you like a further demonstration, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>"You don't have to," Harry said. "We've performed a definitive
experiment. But..." Harry hesitated. He couldn't help himself.
Actually, under the circumstances, he <em>shouldn't</em> be helping
himself. It was right and proper to be curious. "What else
<em>can</em> you do?"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall turned into a cat.</p>
<p>Harry scrambled back unthinkingly, backpedalling so fast that he
tripped over a stray stack of books and landed hard on his bottom
with a <em>thwack.</em> His hands came down to catch himself
without quite reaching properly, and there was a warning twinge in
his shoulder as the weight came down unbraced.</p>
<p>At once the small tabby cat morphed back up into a robed woman.
"I'm sorry, Mr. Potter," said the witch, sounding sincere, though
the corners of her lips were twitching upwards. "I should have
warned you."</p>
<p>Harry was breathing in short gasps. His voice came out choked.
<em>"You can't DO that!"</em></p>
<p>"It's only a Transfiguration," said Professor McGonagall. "An
Animagus transformation, to be exact."</p>
<p>"You turned into a cat! A <em>SMALL</em> cat! You violated
Conservation of Energy! That's not just an arbitrary rule, it's
implied by the form of the quantum Hamiltonian! Rejecting it
destroys unitarity and then you get FTL signalling! And cats are
<em>COMPLICATED!</em> A human mind can't just visualise a whole
cat's anatomy and, and all the cat biochemistry, and what about the
<em>neurology?</em> How can you go on <em>thinking</em> using a
cat-sized brain?"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall's lips were twitching harder now.
"Magic."</p>
<p>"Magic <em>isn't enough</em> to do that! You'd have to be a
god!"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall blinked. "That's the first time I've ever
been called <em>that.</em>"</p>
<p>A blur was coming over Harry's vision, as his brain started to
comprehend what had just broken. The whole idea of a unified
universe with mathematically regular laws, that was what had been
flushed down the toilet; the whole notion of <em>physics</em>.
Three thousand years of resolving big complicated things into
smaller pieces, discovering that the music of the planets was the
same tune as a falling apple, finding that the true laws were
perfectly universal and had no exceptions anywhere and took the
form of simple maths governing the smallest parts, <em>not to
mention</em> that the mind was the brain and the brain was made of
neurons, a brain was what a person <em>was</em> -</p>
<p>And then a woman turned into a cat, so much for all that.</p>
<p>A hundred questions fought for priority over Harry's lips and
the winner poured out: "And, and what kind of incantation is
<em>Wingardium Leviosa?</em> Who invents the words to these spells,
nursery schoolers?"</p>
<p>"That will do, Mr. Potter," Professor McGonagall said crisply,
though her eyes shone with suppressed amusement. "If you wish to
learn about magic, I suggest that we finalise the paperwork so that
you can go to Hogwarts."</p>
<p>"Right," Harry said, somewhat dazed. He pulled his thoughts
together. The March of Reason would just have to start over, that
was all; they still had the experimental method and that was the
important thing. "How do I get to Hogwarts, then?"</p>
<p>A choked laugh escaped Professor McGonagall, as if extracted
from her by tweezers.</p>
<p>"Hold on a moment, Harry," his father said. "Remember why you
haven't been going to school up until now? What about your
condition?"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall spun to face Michael. "His condition?
What's this?"</p>
<p>"I don't sleep right," Harry said. He waved his hands
helplessly. "My sleep cycle is twenty-six hours long, I always go
to sleep two hours later, every day. I can't fall asleep any
earlier than that, and then the next day I go to sleep two hours
later than <em>that.</em> 10PM, 12AM, 2AM, 4AM, until it goes
around the clock. Even if I try to wake up early, it makes no
difference and I'm a wreck that whole day. That's why I haven't
been going to a normal school up until now."</p>
<p>"One of the reasons," said his mother. Harry shot her a
glare.</p>
<p>McGonagall gave a long <em>hmmmmm.</em> "I can't recall hearing
about such a condition before..." she said slowly. "I'll check with
Madam Pomfrey to see if she knows any remedies." Then her face
brightened. "No, I'm sure this won't be a problem - I'll find a
solution in time. Now," and her gaze sharpened again, "what are
these <em>other</em> reasons?"</p>
<p>Harry sent his parents a glare. "I am a conscientious objector
to child conscription, on grounds that I should not have to suffer
for a disintegrating school system's failure to provide teachers or
study materials of even minimally adequate quality."</p>
<p>Both of Harry's parents howled with laughter at that, like they
thought it was all a big joke. "Oh," said Harry's father, eyes
bright, "is <em>that</em> why you bit a maths teacher in third
year."</p>
<p>"<em>She didn't know what a logarithm was!</em> "</p>
<p>"Of course," seconded Harry's mother. "Biting her was a very
mature response to that."</p>
<p>Harry's father nodded. "A well-considered policy for addressing
the problem of teachers who don't understand logarithms."</p>
<p>"I was <em>seven years old!</em> How long are you going to keep
on bringing that up?"</p>
<p>"I know," said his mother sympathetically, "you bite
<em>one</em> maths teacher and they never let you forget it, do
they?"</p>
<p>Harry turned to Professor McGonagall. "There! You see what I
have to deal with?"</p>
<p>"Excuse me," said Petunia, and fled through the backdoor into
the garden, from which her screams of laughter were clearly
audible.</p>
<p>"There, ah, there," Professor McGonagall seemed to be having
trouble speaking for some reason, "there is to be no biting of
teachers at Hogwarts, is that quite clear, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>Harry scowled at her. "Fine, I won't bite anyone who doesn't
bite me first."</p>
<p>Professor Michael Verres-Evans also had to leave the room
briefly upon hearing that.</p>
<p>"Well," Professor McGonagall sighed, after Harry's parents had
composed themselves and returned. "Well. I think, under the
circumstances, that I should avoid taking you to purchase your
study materials until a day or two before school begins."</p>
<p>"What? Why? The other children already know magic, don't they? I
have to start catching up right away!"</p>
<p>"Rest assured, Mr. Potter," replied Professor McGonagall,
"Hogwarts is quite capable of teaching the basics. And I suspect,
Mr. Potter, that if I leave you alone for two months with your
schoolbooks, even without a wand, I will return to this house only
to find a crater billowing purple smoke, a depopulated city
surrounding it and a plague of flaming zebras terrorising what
remains of England."</p>
<p>Harry's mother and father nodded in perfect unison.</p>

<p><em>"Your dad is almost as awesome as my dad."</em></p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Petunia Evans-Verres's lips were trembling and her eyes were
tearing up as Harry hugged her midsection on Platform Nine of the
King's Cross Station. "Are you sure you don't want me to come with
you, Harry?"</p>
<p>Harry glanced over to his father Michael Verres-Evans, who was
looking stereotypically stern-but-proud, and then back to his
mother, who really did look rather... uncomposed. "Mum, I know you
don't like the wizarding world very much. You don't have to come
with. I mean it."</p>
<p>Petunia winced. "Harry, you shouldn't worry about me, I'm your
mother and if you need someone with you -"</p>
<p>"Mum, I'm going to be on my own at Hogwarts for <em>months</em>
and <em>months.</em> If I can't manage a train platform alone,
better to find out sooner rather than later so we can abort." He
lowered his voice to a whisper. "Besides, Mum, they all love me
over there. If I have any problems, all I need to do is take off my
sweatband," Harry tapped the exercise band covering his scar, "and
I'll have <em>way</em> more help than I can handle."</p>
<p>"Oh, Harry," Petunia whispered. She knelt down and hugged him
hard, face to face, their cheeks resting against each other. Harry
could feel her ragged breathing, and then he heard a muffled sob
escape. "Oh, Harry, I do love you, always remember that."</p>
<p><em>It's like she's afraid she'll never see me again,</em> the
thought popped into Harry's head. He knew the thought was true but
he didn't know why Mum was so afraid.</p>
<p>So he made a guess. "Mum, you know that I'm not going to turn
into your sister just because I'm learning magic, right? I'll do
any magic you ask for - if I can, I mean - or if you want me
<em>not</em> to use any magic around the house, I'll do that too, I
promise I'll never let magic come between us -"</p>
<p>A tight hug cut off his words. "You have a good heart," his
mother whispered into his ear. "A very good heart, my son."</p>
<p>Harry choked up himself a little, then.</p>
<p>His mother released him, and stood up. She took a handkerchief
out of her handbag, and with a trembling hand dabbed at the running
makeup around her eyes.</p>
<p>There were no questions about his father accompanying him to the
magical side of King's Cross Station. Dad had trouble just looking
at Harry's trunk directly. Magic ran in families, and Michael
Verres-Evans couldn't even walk.</p>
<p>So instead his father just cleared his throat. "Good luck at
school, Harry," he said. "Do you think I bought you enough
books?"</p>
<p>Harry had explained to his father about how he thought this
might be his big chance to do something really revolutionary and
important, and Professor Verres-Evans had nodded and dumped his
extremely busy schedule for two solid days in order to go on the
Greatest Secondhand Bookshop Raid Ever, which had covered four
cities and produced <em>thirty</em> boxes of science books now
sitting in the cavern level of Harry's trunk. Most of the books had
gone for a pound or two, but some of them definitely
<em>hadn't,</em> like the very latest <em>Handbook of Chemistry and
Physics</em> or the complete 1972 set of the <em>Encyclopaedia
Britannica.</em> His father had tried to block Harry off from
seeing the till displays but Harry figured his father must have
spent <em>at least</em> a thousand pounds. Harry had said to his
father that he would pay him back as soon as he figured out how to
convert wizarding gold into Muggle money, and his father had told
him to go jump in a lake.</p>
<p>And then his father had asked him: <em>Do you think I bought you
enough books?</em> It was quite clear what answer Dad wanted to
hear.</p>
<p>Harry's throat was hoarse, for some reason. "You can never have
enough books," he recited the Verres family motto, and his father
knelt down and gave him a quick, firm embrace. "But you
<em>certainly</em> tried," Harry said, and felt himself choking up
again. "It was a really, really, <em>really</em> good try."</p>
<p>His Dad straightened. "So..." he said. "Do <em>you</em> see a
Platform Nine and Three-Quarters?"</p>
<p>King's Cross Station was huge and busy, with walls and floors
paved with ordinary dirt-stained tiles. It was full of ordinary
people hurrying about their ordinary business, having ordinary
conversations which generated lots and lots of ordinary noise.
King's Cross Station had a Platform Nine (which they were standing
on) and a Platform Ten (right nearby) but there was nothing between
Platform Nine and Platform Ten except a thin, unpromising barrier
wall. A great skylight overhead let in plenty of light to
illuminate the total lack whatsoever of any Platform Nine and
Three-Quarters.</p>
<p>Harry stared around until his eyes watered, thinking, <em>come
on, mage-sight, come on, mage-sight</em>, but absolutely nothing
appeared to him. He thought about taking out his wand and waving
it, but Professor McGonagall had warned him against using his wand.
Plus if there was another shower of multicoloured sparks that might
lead to being arrested for setting off fireworks inside a train
station. And that was assuming his wand didn't decide to do
something else, like blowing up all of King's Cross. Harry had only
lightly skimmed his schoolbooks (though that skim was quite bizarre
enough) in a very quick effort to determine what sort of science
books to buy over the next 48 hours.</p>
<p>Well, he had - Harry glanced at his watch - one whole hour to
figure it out, since he was supposed to be on the train at eleven.
Maybe this was the equivalent of an IQ test and the stupid kids
couldn't become wizards. (And the amount of extra time you gave
yourself would determine your Conscientiousness, which was the
second most important factor in scholarly success.)</p>
<p>"I'll figure it out," Harry said to his waiting parents. "It's
probably some sort of test thingy."</p>
<p>His father frowned. "Hm... maybe look for a trail of mixed
footprints on the ground, leading somewhere that doesn't seem to
make sense -"</p>
<p>"<em>Dad!</em> " Harry said. "Stop that! I haven't even
<em>tried</em> to figure it out on my own!" It was a very good
suggestion, too, which was worse.</p>
<p>"Sorry," his father apologised.</p>
<p>"Ah..." Harry's mother said. "I don't think they would do that
to a student, do you? Are you sure Professor McGonagall didn't tell
you anything?"</p>
<p>"Maybe she was distracted," Harry said without thinking.</p>
<p>"<em>Harry!</em> " hissed his father and mother in unison.
"<em>What did you do?</em> "</p>
<p>"I, um -" Harry swallowed. "Look, we don't have time for this
now -"</p>
<p>"<em>Harry!</em> "</p>
<p>"I mean it! We don't have time for this now! Because it's a
really long story and I've got to figure out how to get to
school!"</p>
<p>His mother had a hand over her face. "How bad was it?"</p>
<p>"I, ah," <em>I can't talk about that for reasons of National
Security,</em> "about half as bad as the Incident with the Science
Project?"</p>
<p>"<em>Harry!</em> "</p>
<p>"I, er, oh look there are some people with an owl I'll go ask
them how to get in!" and Harry ran away from his parents towards
the family of fiery redheads, his trunk automatically slithering
behind him.</p>
<p>The plump woman looked to him as he arrived. "Hello, dear. First
time at Hogwarts? Ron's new, too -" and then she peered closely at
him. "<em>Harry Potter?</em> "</p>
<p>Four boys and a red-headed girl and an owl all swung around and
then froze in place.</p>
<p>"Oh, <em>come on!</em> " Harry protested. He'd been planning to
go as Harry Verres at least until he got to Hogwarts. "I bought a
sweatband and everything! How come you know who I am?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry's father said, coming up behind him with long easy
strides, "how <em>do</em> you know who he is?" His voice indicated
a certain dread.</p>
<p>"Your picture was in the newspapers," said one of two
identical-looking twins.</p>
<p>"<em>HARRY!</em> "</p>
<p>"<em>Dad!</em> It's not like that! It's 'cause I defeated the
Dark Lord You-Know-Who when I was one year old!"</p>
<p>"<em>WHAT?</em> "</p>
<p>"Mum can explain."</p>
<p>"<em>WHAT?</em> "</p>
<p>"Ah... Michael dear, there are certain things I thought it would
be best not to bother you with until now -"</p>
<p>"Excuse me," Harry said to the redheaded family who were all
staring at him, "but it would be quite extremely helpful if you
could tell me how to get to Platform Nine and Three Quarters
<em>right now</em>."</p>
<p>"Ah..." said the woman. She raised a hand and pointed at the
wall between platforms. "Just walk straight at the barrier between
platforms nine and ten. Don't stop and don't be scared you'll crash
into it, that's very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if
you're nervous."</p>
<p>"And whatever you do, don't think of an elephant."</p>
<p>"<em>George!</em> Ignore him, Harry dear, there's no reason not
to think of an elephant."</p>
<p>"I'm Fred, Mum, not George -"</p>
<p>"Thanks!" Harry said and took off at a run towards the barrier
-</p>
<p>Wait a minute, it wouldn't work <em>unless he believed in
it?</em></p>
<p>It was at times like this that Harry hated his mind for actually
working fast enough to realise that this was a case where "resonant
doubt" applied, that is, if he'd started out thinking that he would
go through the barrier he'd have been fine, only now he was worried
about whether he sufficiently <em>believed</em> he'd go through the
barrier, which meant that he actually <em>was</em> worried about
crashing into it -</p>
<p>"<em>Harry! Get back here, you have some explaining to
do!</em> " That was his Dad.</p>
<p>Harry shut his eyes and ignored everything he knew about
justified credibility and just tried to believe <em>really
hard</em> that he'd go through the barrier and -</p>
<p>- the sounds around him changed.</p>
<p>Harry opened his eyes and stumbled to a halt, feeling vaguely
dirtied by having made a deliberate effort to believe
something.</p>
<p>He was standing in a bright, open-air platform next to a single
huge train, fourteen long carriages headed up by a massive
scarlet-metal steam engine with a tall chimney that promised death
to air quality. The platform was already lightly crowded (even
though Harry was a full hour early); dozens of children and their
parents swarmed around benches, tables, and various hawkers and
stalls.</p>
<p>It went entirely without saying that there was no such place in
King's Cross Station and no room to hide it.</p>
<p><em>Okay, so either (a) I just teleported somewhere else
entirely (b) they can fold space like no one's business or (c) they
are simply ignoring all the rules.</em></p>
<p>There was a slithering sound behind him, and Harry turned around
to observe that his trunk had indeed followed him on its small
clawed tentacles. Apparently, for magical purposes, his luggage had
also managed to believe with sufficient strength to pass through
the barrier. That was actually a little disturbing when Harry
started thinking about it.</p>
<p>A moment later, the youngest-looking red-haired boy came through
the iron archway (iron archway?) at a run, pulling his trunk behind
him on a lead and nearly crashing into Harry. Harry, feeling stupid
for having stayed around, quickly began moving away from the
landing area, and the red-haired boy followed him, yanking hard on
his trunk's lead in order to keep up. A moment later, a white owl
fluttered through the archway and came to rest on the boy's
shoulder.</p>
<p>"Cor," said the red-haired boy, "are you <em>really</em> Harry
Potter?"</p>
<p><em>Not this again.</em> "I have no logical way of knowing that
for certain. My parents raised me to <em>believe</em> that my name
was Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, and many people here have told
me that I <em>look</em> like my parents, I mean my other parents,
but," Harry frowned, realising, "for all <em>I</em> know, there
could easily be spells to polymorph a child into a specified
appearance -"</p>
<p>"Er, what, mate?"</p>
<p><em>Not headed for Ravenclaw, I take it.</em> "Yes, I'm Harry
Potter."</p>
<p>"I'm Ron Weasley," said the tall skinny freckled long-nosed kid,
and stuck out a hand, which Harry politely shook as they walked.
The owl gave Harry an oddly measured and courteous hoot (actually
more of an eehhhhh sound, which surprised Harry).</p>
<p>At this point Harry realised the potential for imminent
catastrophe. "Just a second," he said to Ron, and opened one of the
drawers of his trunk, the one that if he recalled correctly was for
Winter Clothes - it was - and then he found the lightest scarf he
owned, underneath his winter coat. Harry took off his sweatband,
and just as quickly unfolded the scarf and tied it around his face.
It was a little hot, especially in the summer, but Harry could live
with that.</p>
<p>Then he shut that drawer and pulled out another drawer and drew
forth black wizarding robes, which he shrugged over his head, now
that he was out of Muggle territory.</p>
<p>"There," Harry said. The sound came out slightly muffled through
the scarf over his face. He turned to Ron. "How do I look? Stupid,
I know, but am I identifiable as Harry Potter?"</p>
<p>"Er," Ron said. He closed his mouth, which had been open. "Not
really, Harry."</p>
<p>"Very good," Harry said. "However, so as not to obviate the
point of the whole exercise, you will henceforth address me as,"
Verres might not work anymore, "Mr. Spoo."</p>
<p>"Okay, Harry," Ron said uncertainly.</p>
<p><em>The Force is not particularly strong in this one.</em>
"Call... me... Mister... Spoo."</p>
<p>"Okay, Mister Spoo -" Ron stopped. "I can't do that, it makes me
feel stupid."</p>
<p><em>That's not just a feeling.</em> "Okay. <em>You</em> pick a
name."</p>
<p>"Mr. Cannon," Ron said at once. "For the Chudley Cannons."</p>
<p>"Ah..." Harry knew he was going to terribly regret asking this.
"Who or what are the Chudley Cannons?"</p>
<p>"<em>Who're the Chudley Cannons?</em> Only the most brilliant
team in the whole history of Quidditch! Sure, they finished at the
bottom of the league last year, but -"</p>
<p>"What's Quidditch?"</p>
<p>Asking this was also a mistake.</p>
<p>"So let me get this straight," Harry said as it seemed that
Ron's explanation (with associated hand gestures) was winding down.
"Catching the Snitch is worth <em>one hundred and fifty
points?</em> "</p>
<p>"Yeah -"</p>
<p>"How many ten-point goals does one side usually score
<em>not</em> counting the Snitch?"</p>
<p>"Um, maybe fifteen or twenty in professional games -"</p>
<p>"That's just wrong. That violates every possible rule of game
design. Look, the rest of this game sounds like it might make
sense, sort of, for a sport I mean, but you're basically saying
that catching the Snitch overwhelms almost any ordinary point
spread. The two Seekers are up there flying around looking for the
Snitch and usually not interacting with anyone else, spotting the
Snitch first is going to be mostly luck -"</p>
<p>"It's not luck!" protested Ron. "You've got to keep your eyes
moving in the right pattern -"</p>
<p>"That's not <em>interactive,</em> there's no back-and-forth with
the other player and how much fun is it to watch someone incredibly
good at moving their eyes? And then whichever Seeker gets lucky
swoops in and grabs the Snitch and makes everyone else's work moot.
It's like someone took a real game and grafted on this pointless
extra position so that you could be the Most Important Player
without needing to really get involved or learn the rest of it. Who
was the first Seeker, the King's idiot son who wanted to play
Quidditch but couldn't understand the rules?" Actually, now that
Harry thought about it, that seemed like a surprisingly good
hypothesis. Put him on a broomstick and tell him to catch the shiny
thing...</p>
<p>Ron's face pulled into a scowl. "If you don't like Quidditch,
you don't have to make fun of it!"</p>
<p>"If you can't criticise, you can't optimise. I'm suggesting how
to <em>improve the game.</em> And it's very simple. Get rid of the
Snitch."</p>
<p>"They won't change the game just 'cause <em>you</em> say
so!"</p>
<p>"I <em>am</em> the Boy-Who-Lived, you know. People will listen
to me. And maybe if I can persuade them to change the game at
Hogwarts, the innovation will spread."</p>
<p>A look of absolute horror was spreading over Ron's face. "But,
but if you get rid of the Snitch, how will anyone know when the
game ends?"</p>
<p>"<em>Buy... a... clock.</em> It would be a lot fairer than
having the game sometimes end after ten minutes and sometimes not
end for hours, and the schedule would be a lot more predictable for
the spectators, too." Harry sighed. "Oh, stop giving me that look
of absolute horror, I probably won't <em>actually</em> take the
time to destroy this pathetic excuse for a national sport and
remake it stronger and smarter in my own image. I've got way, way,
<em>way</em> more important stuff to worry about." Harry looked
thoughtful. "Then again, it wouldn't <em>take</em> much time to
write up the Ninety-Five Theses of the Snitchless Reformation and
nail it to a church door -"</p>
<p>"Potter," drawled a young boy's voice, "<em>what</em> is that on
your face and <em>what</em> is standing next to you?"</p>
<p>Ron's look of horror was replaced by utter hatred.
"<em>You!</em> "</p>
<p>Harry turned his head; and indeed it was Draco Malfoy, who might
have been forced to wear standard school robes, but was making up
for that with a trunk looking at least as magical and far more
elegant than Harry's own, decorated in silver and emeralds and
bearing what Harry guessed to be the Malfoy family crest, a
beautiful fanged serpent over crossed ivory wands.</p>
<p>"Draco!" Harry said. "Er, or Malfoy if you prefer, though that
kind of sounds like Lucius to me. I'm glad to see you're doing so
well after, um, our last meeting. This is Ron Weasley. And I'm
trying to go incognito, so call me, eh," Harry looked down at his
robes, "Mister Black."</p>
<p>"<em>Harry!</em> " hissed Ron. "You can't use <em>that</em>
name!"</p>
<p>Harry blinked. "Why not?" It <em>sounded</em> nicely dark, like
an international man of mystery -</p>
<p>"I'd say it's a <em>fine</em> name," said Draco, "but it belongs
to the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black. I'll call you Mr.
Silver."</p>
<p>"<em>You</em> get away from... from Mr. Gold," Ron said coldly,
and took a forward step. "He doesn't need to talk to the likes of
you!"</p>
<p>Harry raised a placating hand. "I'll go by Mr. Bronze, thanks
for the naming schema. And, Ron, um," Harry struggled to find a way
to say this, "I'm glad you're so... enthusiastic about protecting
me, but I don't particularly mind talking to Draco -"</p>
<p>This was apparently the last straw for Ron, who spun on Harry
with eyes now aflame with outrage. "<em>What?</em> Do you
<em>know</em> who this is?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Ron," Harry said, "you may remember that I called him
Draco without him needing to introduce himself."</p>
<p>Draco sniggered. Then his eyes lit on the white owl on Ron's
shoulder. "Oh, what's <em>this?</em> " Draco said in a drawl rich
with malice. "Where's the famous Weasley family rat?"</p>
<p>"Buried in the backyard," Ron said coldly.</p>
<p>"Aw, how sad. Pot... ah, Mr. Bronze, I should mention that the
Weasley family is widely agreed to have <em>the best pet story
ever</em>. Want to tell it, Weasley?"</p>
<p>Ron's face contorted. "You wouldn't think it was funny if it
happened to <em>your</em> family!"</p>
<p>"Oh," Draco purred, "but it wouldn't ever <em>happen</em> to the
Malfoys."</p>
<p>Ron's hands clenched into fists -</p>
<p>"That's enough," Harry said, putting as much quiet authority
into the voice as he could manage. It was clear that whatever this
was about, it was a painful memory for the red-haired kid. "If Ron
doesn't want to talk about it, he doesn't have to talk about it,
and I'd ask that you not talk about it either."</p>
<p>Draco turned a surprised look on Harry, and Ron nodded. "That's
right, Harry! I mean Mr. Bronze! You see what kind of person he is?
Now tell him to go away!"</p>
<p>Harry counted to ten inside his head, which for him was a very
quick <em>12345678910</em> - an odd habit left over from the age of
five when his mother had first instructed him to do it, and Harry
had reasoned that his way was faster and ought to be just as
effective. "I'm not telling him to go away," Harry said calmly.
"He's welcome to talk to me if he wants."</p>
<p>"Well, I don't intend to hang around with anyone who hangs
around with Draco Malfoy," Ron announced coldly.</p>
<p>Harry shrugged. "That's up to you. <em>I</em> don't intend to
let anyone say who I can and can't hang around with." Silently
chanting, <em>please go away, please go away...</em></p>
<p>Ron's face went blank with surprise, like he'd actually expected
that line to work. Then Ron spun about, yanked his luggage's lead
and stormed off down the platform.</p>
<p>"If you didn't like him," Draco said curiously, "why didn't you
just walk away?"</p>
<p>"Um... his mother helped me figure out how to get to this
platform from the King's Cross Station, so it was kind of hard to
tell him to get lost. And it's not that I <em>hate</em> this Ron
guy," Harry said, "I just, just..." Harry searched for words.</p>
<p>"Don't see any reason for him to exist?" offered Draco.</p>
<p>"Pretty much."</p>
<p>"Anyway, Potter... if you really were raised by Muggles -" Draco
paused here, as if waiting for a denial, but Harry didn't say
anything "- then you mightn't know what it's like to be famous.
People want to take up <em>all</em> of our time. You <em>have</em>
to learn to say no."</p>
<p>Harry nodded, putting a thoughtful look on his face. "That
sounds like good advice."</p>
<p>"If you try to be nice, you just end up spending the most time
with the pushiest ones. Decide who you <em>want</em> to spend time
with and make everyone else leave. You're just getting here,
Potter, so everyone's going to judge you by who they see you with,
and you don't want to be seen with the likes of Ron Weasley."</p>
<p>Harry nodded again. "If you don't mind my asking, how did you
recognise me?"</p>
<p>"<em>Mister Bronze</em>," Draco drawled, "I <em>have</em> met
you, remember. I saw someone going around with a scarf wrapped
around his head, looking absolutely ridiculous. So I took a
<em>guess.</em>"</p>
<p>Harry bowed his head, accepting the compliment. "I'm
<em>terribly</em> sorry about that," Harry said. "Our first
meeting, I mean. I didn't mean to embarrass you in front of
Lucius."</p>
<p>Draco waved it off while giving Harry an odd look. "I just wish
Father could have come in while <em>you</em> were flattering
<em>me</em> -" Draco laughed. "But thank <em>you</em> for what you
said to Father. If not for that, I might've had a harder time
explaining."</p>
<p>Harry swept a deeper bow. "And thank <em>you</em> for
reciprocating with what you said to Professor McGonagall."</p>
<p>"You're welcome. Though one of the assistants must've sworn her
closest friend to absolute secrecy, because Father says there're
<em>weird rumors</em> going around, like you and I got in a fight
or something."</p>
<p>"Ouch," Harry said, wincing. "I'm <em>really</em> sorry -"</p>
<p>"No, we're used to it, Merlin knows there's lots of rumors about
the Malfoy family already."</p>
<p>Harry nodded. "I'm glad to hear you're not in trouble."</p>
<p>Draco smirked. "Father has, um, a <em>refined</em> sense of
humor, but he <em>does</em> understand making friends. He
understands it <em>very</em> well. He made me repeat that before I
went to bed every night for the last month, 'I will make friends at
Hogwarts.' When I explained everything to him and he saw that's
what I was doing, he bought me an ice-cream."</p>
<p>Harry's jaw dropped. "<em>You managed to spin that into an
ice-cream?</em> "</p>
<p>Draco nodded, looking every bit as smug as the feat deserved.
"Well, father <em>knew</em> what I was doing, of course, but he's
the one who taught me <em>how</em> to do it, and if I grin the
right way <em>while</em> I'm doing it, that makes it a father-son
thing and then he <em>has</em> to buy me an ice-cream or I'll give
him this sort of sad look, like I think I must have disappointed
him."</p>
<p>Harry eyed Draco calculatingly, sensing the presence of another
master. "You've had <em>lessons</em> on how to manipulate
people?"</p>
<p>"Of course," Draco said proudly. "I'm a <em>Malfoy.</em> Father
bought me tutors."</p>
<p>"Wow," Harry said. Reading Robert Cialdini's <em>Influence:
Science and Practice</em> probably didn't stack up very high
compared to that (though it was still one heck of a book). "Your
dad is almost as awesome as my dad."</p>
<p>Draco's eyebrows rose loftily. "Oh? And what does <em>your</em>
father do?"</p>
<p>"He buys me books."</p>
<p>Draco considered this. "That doesn't sound very impressive."</p>
<p>"You had to be there. Anyway, I'm glad to hear all that. The way
Lucius was looking at you, I thought he was going to c-crucify
you."</p>
<p>"My father really loves me," Draco said firmly. "He wouldn't
ever do that."</p>
<p>"Um..." Harry said. He remembered the black-robed, white-haired
figure of elegance that had stormed through Madam Malkin's,
wielding that beautiful, deadly silver-handled cane. It wasn't easy
to visualise him as a doting father. "Don't take this the wrong
way, but how do you <em>know</em> that?"</p>
<p>"Huh?" It was clear that this was a question Draco did not
commonly ask himself.</p>
<p>"I ask the fundamental question of rationality: Why do you
believe what you believe? What do you think you know and how do you
think you know it? What makes you think Lucius wouldn't sacrifice
you the same way he'd sacrifice anything else for power?"</p>
<p>Draco shot Harry another odd look. "Just what do <em>you</em>
know about Father?"</p>
<p>"Um... seat on the Wizengamot, seat on Hogwarts' Board of
Governors, incredibly wealthy, has the ear of Minister Fudge, has
the confidence of Minister Fudge, probably has some highly
embarrassing photos of Minister Fudge, most prominent blood purist
now that the Dark Lord's gone, former Death Eater who was found to
have the Dark Mark but got off by claiming to be under the Imperius
Curse, which was ridiculously implausible and pretty much everyone
knew it... evil with a capital 'E' and a born killer... I think
that's it."</p>
<p>Draco's eyes had narrowed to slits. "McGonagall told you that,
did she."</p>
<p>"No, she wouldn't say <em>anything</em> to me about Lucius
afterwards, except to stay away from him. So during the Incident at
the Potions Shop, while Professor McGonagall was busy yelling at
the shopkeeper and trying to get everything under control, I
grabbed one of the customers and asked <em>them</em> about
Lucius."</p>
<p>Draco's eyes were wide again. "Did you <em>really?</em> "</p>
<p>Harry gave Draco a puzzled look. "If I lied the first time, I'm
not going to tell you the truth just because you ask twice."</p>
<p>There was a certain pause as Draco absorbed this.</p>
<p>"You're so completely going to be in Slytherin."</p>
<p>"I'm so completely going to be in Ravenclaw, thank you very
much. I only want power so I can get books."</p>
<p>Draco giggled. "Yeah, right. Anyway... to answer what you
asked..." Draco took a deep breath, and his face turned serious.
"Father once missed a Wizengamot vote for me. I was on a broom and
I fell off and broke a lot of ribs. It really hurt. I'd never hurt
that much before and I thought I was going to die. So Father missed
this really important vote, because he was there by my bed at St.
Mungo's, holding my hands and promising me that I was going to be
okay."</p>
<p>Harry glanced away uncomfortably, then, with an effort, forced
himself to look back at Draco. "Why are you telling me
<em>that?</em> It seems sort of... private..."</p>
<p>Draco gave Harry a serious look. "One of my tutors once said
that people form close friendships by knowing private things about
each other, and the reason most people don't make close friends is
because they're too embarrassed to share anything really important
about themselves." Draco turned his palms out invitingly. "Your
turn?"</p>
<p>Knowing that Draco's hopeful face had probably been drilled into
him by months of practice did not make it any less effective, Harry
observed. Actually it <em>did</em> make it <em>less</em> effective,
but unfortunately not <em>ineffective.</em> The same could be said
of Draco's clever use of reciprocation pressure for an unsolicited
gift, a technique which Harry had read about in his social
psychology books (one experiment had shown that an unconditional
gift of $5 was twice as effective as a conditional offer of $50 in
getting people to fill out surveys). Draco had made an unsolicited
gift of a confidence, and now invited Harry to offer a confidence
in return... and the thing was, Harry <em>did</em> feel pressured.
Refusal, Harry was certain, would be met with a look of sad
disappointment, and maybe a small amount of contempt indicating
that Harry had lost points.</p>
<p>"Draco," Harry said, "just so you know, I recognise exactly what
you're doing right now. My own books called it
<em>reciprocation</em> and they talk about how giving someone a
straight gift of two Sickles was found to be twice as effective as
offering them twenty Sickles in getting them to do what you
want..." Harry trailed off.</p>
<p>Draco was looking sad and disappointed. "It's not meant as a
trick, Harry. It's a real way of becoming friends."</p>
<p>Harry held up a hand. "I didn't say I wasn't going to respond. I
just need time to pick something that's private but just as
non-damaging. Let's say... I wanted you to know that I can't be
rushed into things." A pause to reflect could go a long way in
defusing the power of a lot of compliance techniques, once you
learned to recognise them for what they were.</p>
<p>"All right," Draco said. "I'll wait while you come up with
something. Oh, and please take off the scarf while you say it."</p>
<p><em>Simple but effective.</em></p>
<p>And Harry couldn't help but notice how clumsy, awkward,
graceless his attempt at resisting manipulation / saving face /
showing off had appeared compared to Draco. <em>I need those
tutors.</em></p>
<p>"All right," Harry said after a time. "Here's mine." He glanced
around and then rolled the scarf back up over his face, exposing
everything but the scar. "Um... it sounds like you can really rely
on your father. I mean... if you talk to him seriously, he'll
always listen to you and take you seriously."</p>
<p>Draco nodded.</p>
<p>"Sometimes," Harry said, and swallowed. This was surprisingly
hard, but then it was meant to be. "Sometimes I wish my own Dad was
like yours." Harry's eyes flinched away from Draco's face, more or
less automatically, and then Harry forced himself to look back at
Draco.</p>
<p>Then it hit Harry <em>what on Earth he'd just said</em>, and
Harry hastily added, "Not that I wish my Dad was a flawless
instrument of death like Lucius, I only mean taking me seriously
-"</p>
<p>"I understand," Draco said with a smile. "There... now doesn't
it feel like we're a little closer to being friends?"</p>
<p>Harry nodded. "Yeah. It does, actually. Um... no offence, but
I'm going to put on my disguise again, I <em>really</em> don't want
to deal with -"</p>
<p>"I understand."</p>
<p>Harry rolled the scarf back down over his face.</p>
<p>"My father takes all his friends seriously," Draco said. "That's
why he has lots of friends. You should meet him."</p>
<p>"I'll think about it," Harry said in a neutral voice. He shook
his head in wonder. "So you really are his one weak point.
Huh."</p>
<p>Now Draco was giving Harry a <em>really</em> odd look. "You want
to go get something to drink and find somewhere to sit down?"</p>
<p>Harry realised he had been standing in one place for too long,
and stretched himself, trying to crick his back. "Sure."</p>
<p>The platform was starting to fill up now, but there was still a
quieter area on the far side away from the red steam engine. Along
the way they passed a stall containing a bald, bearded man offering
newspapers and comic books and stacked neon-green cans.</p>
<p>The stallholder was, in fact, leaning back and drinking out of
one of the neon-green cans at the exact point when he spotted the
refined and elegant Draco Malfoy approaching along with a
mysterious boy looking incredibly stupid with a scarf tied over his
face, causing the stallholder to experience a sudden coughing fit
in mid-drink and dribble a large amount of neon-green liquid onto
his beard.</p>
<p>"'Scuse me," Harry said, "but what <em>is</em> that stuff,
exactly?"</p>
<p>"Comed-Tea," said the stallholder. "If you drink it, something
surprising is bound to happen which makes you spill it on yourself
or someone else. But it's charmed to vanish just a few seconds
later -" Indeed the stain on his beard was already
disappearing.</p>
<p>"How droll," said Draco. "How very, very droll. Come, Mr.
Bronze, let's go find another -"</p>
<p>"Hold on," Harry said.</p>
<p>"<em>Oh come on!</em> That's just, just <em>juvenile!</em> "</p>
<p>"No, I'm sorry Draco, I <em>have</em> to investigate this. What
happens if I drink Comed-Tea while doing my best to keep the
conversation completely serious?"</p>
<p>The stallholder smiled mysteriously. "Who knows? A friend walks
by in a frog costume? Something unexpected is bound to happen
-"</p>
<p>"No. I'm sorry. I just don't believe it. That violates my
much-abused suspension of disbelief on so many levels I don't even
have the language to describe it. There is, there is just <em>no
way</em> a bloody <em>drink</em> can manipulate reality to produce
<em>comedy setups</em>, or I'm going to give up and retire to the
Bahamas -"</p>
<p>Draco groaned. "Are we <em>really</em> going to do this?"</p>
<p>"You don't have to drink it but I <em>have</em> to investigate.
<em>Have</em> to. How much?"</p>
<p>"Five Knuts the can," the stallholder said.</p>
<p>"<em>Five Knuts?</em> You can sell reality-manipulating fizzy
drinks for <em>five Knuts the can?"</em> Harry reached into his
pouch, said "four Sickles, four Knuts", and slapped them down on
the counter. "Two dozen cans please."</p>
<p>"I'll also take one," Draco sighed, and started to reach for his
pockets.</p>
<p>Harry shook his head rapidly. "No, I've got this, doesn't count
as a favor either, I want to see if it works for you too." He took
a can from the stack now placed on the counter and tossed it to
Draco, then started feeding his pouch. The pouch's Widening Lip ate
the cans accompanied by small burping noises, which wasn't exactly
helping to restore Harry's faith that he would someday discover a
reasonable explanation for all this.</p>
<p>Twenty-two burps later, Harry had the last purchased can in his
hand, Draco was looking at him expectantly, and the two of them
pulled the ring at the same time.</p>
<p>Harry rolled up his scarf to expose his mouth, and they tilted
their heads back and drank the Comed-Tea.</p>
<p>It somehow <em>tasted</em> bright green - extra-fizzy and limer
than lime.</p>
<p>Aside from that, nothing else happened.</p>
<p>Harry looked at the stallholder, who was watching them
benevolently.</p>
<p><em>All right, if this guy just took advantage of a natural
accident to sell me twenty-four cans of nothing</em><em>, I'm going
to applaud his creative entrepreneurial spirit and then kill
him.</em></p>
<p>"It doesn't always happen immediately," the stallholder said.
"But it's guaranteed to happen once per can, or your money
back."</p>
<p>Harry took another long drink.</p>
<p>Once again, nothing happened.</p>
<p><em>Maybe I should just chug the whole thing as fast as
possible... and hope my stomach doesn't explode from all the carbon
dioxide, or that I don't burp while drinking it...</em></p>
<p>No, he could afford to be a <em>little</em> patient. But
honestly, Harry didn't see how this was going to work. You couldn't
go up to someone and say "Now I'm going to surprise you" or "And
now I'm going to tell you the punchline of the joke, and it'll be
really funny." It ruined the shock value. In Harry's state of
mental preparedness, Lucius Malfoy could have walked past in a
ballerina outfit and it wouldn't have made him do a proper
spit-take. Just what sort of wacky shenanigan was the universe
supposed to cough up <em>now?</em></p>
<p>"Anyway, let's sit down," Harry said. He prepared to swig
another drink and started towards the distant seating area, which
put him at the right angle to glance back and see the portion of
the stall's newspaper stand that was devoted to a newspaper called
<em>The Quibbler</em>, which was showing the following
headline:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>BOY-WHO-LIVED GETS<br>
DRACO MALFOY PREGNANT</em></p>
<p>"<em>Gah!</em> " screamed Draco as bright green liquid sprayed
all over him from Harry's direction. Draco turned to Harry with
fire in his eyes and grabbed his own can. "You son of a mudblood!
Let's see how <em>you</em> like being spat upon!" Draco took a
deliberate swig from the can just as his own eyes caught sight of
the headline.</p>
<p>In sheer reflex action, Harry tried to block his face as the
spray of liquid flew in his direction. Unfortunately he blocked
using the hand containing the Comed-Tea, sending the rest of the
green liquid to splash out over his shoulder.</p>
<p>Harry stared at the can in his hand even as he went on choking
and spluttering and the green colour started to vanish from Draco's
robes.</p>
<p>Then he looked up and stared at the newspaper headline.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>BOY-WHO-LIVED GETS<br>
DRACO MALFOY PREGNANT</em></p>
<p>Harry's lips opened and said, "buh-bluh-buh-buh..."</p>
<p>Too many competing objections, that was the problem. Every time
Harry tried to say "But we're only eleven!" the objection "But men
can't get pregnant!" demanded first priority and was then run over
by "But there's nothing between us, really!"</p>
<p>Then Harry looked down at the can in his hand again.</p>
<p>He was feeling a deep-seated desire to run away screaming at the
top of his lungs until he dropped from lack of oxygen, and the only
thing stopping him was that he had once read that outright panic
was the sign of a <em>truly</em> important scientific problem.</p>
<p>Harry snarled, threw the can violently into a nearby rubbish
bin, and stalked back over to the stall. "One copy of <em>The
Quibbler,</em> please." Harry paid over four more Knuts, retrieved
another can of Comed-Tea from his pouch, and then stalked over to
the picnic area with the blond-haired boy, who was staring at his
own can with an expression of frank admiration.</p>
<p>"I take it back," Draco said, "that was pretty good."</p>
<p>"Hey, Draco, you know what I bet is even better for becoming
friends than exchanging secrets? Committing murder."</p>
<p>"I have a tutor who says that," Draco allowed. He reached inside
his robes and scratched himself with an easy, natural motion.
"Who've you got in mind?"</p>
<p>Harry slammed <em>The Quibbler</em> down hard on the picnic
table. "The guy who came up with this headline."</p>
<p>Draco groaned. "Not a guy. A girl. A <em>ten-year-old</em> girl,
can you believe it? She went nuts after her mother died and her
father, who owns this newspaper, is <em>convinced</em> that she's a
seer, so when he doesn't know he asks Luna Lovegood and believes
<em>anything</em> she says."</p>
<p>Not really thinking about it, Harry pulled the ring on his next
can of Comed-Tea and prepared to drink. "Are you kidding me? That's
even worse than Muggle journalism, which I would have thought was
physically impossible."</p>
<p>Draco snarled. "She has some sort of perverse obsession about
the Malfoys, too, and her father is politically opposed to us so he
prints every word. As soon as I'm old enough I'm going to rape
her."</p>
<p>Green liquid spurted out of Harry's nostrils, soaking into the
scarf still covering that area. Comed-Tea and lungs did not mix,
and Harry spent the next few seconds frantically coughing.</p>
<p>Draco looked at him sharply. "Something wrong?"</p>
<p>It was at this point that Harry came to the sudden realisation
that (a) the sounds coming from the rest of the train platform had
turned into more of a blurred white noise at around the same time
Draco had reached inside his robes, and (b) when he had discussed
committing murder as a bonding method, there had been exactly one
person in the conversation who'd thought they were joking.</p>
<p><em>Right. Because he</em> seemed <em>like such a normal kid.
And he</em> is <em>a normal kid, he is just what you'd</em> expect
<em>a baseline male child to be like if Darth Vader were his doting
father.</em></p>
<p>"Yes, well," Harry coughed, oh god how was he going to get out
of this conversational wedge, "I was just surprised at how you were
willing to discuss it so openly, you didn't seem worried about
getting caught or anything."</p>
<p>Draco snorted. "Are you joking? <em>Luna Lovegood's</em> word
against mine?"</p>
<p>Holy crap on a holy stick. "There's no such thing as magical
truth detection, I take it?" <em>Or DNA testing... yet.</em></p>
<p>Draco looked around. His eyes narrowed. "That's right, you don't
know anything. Look, I'll explain things to you, I mean the way it
really works, just like you were already in Slytherin and asked me
the same question. But you've got to swear not to say anything
about it."</p>
<p>"I swear," Harry said.</p>
<p>"The courts use Veritaserum, but it's a joke really, you just
get yourself Obliviated before you testify and then claim the other
person was Memory-Charmed with a fake memory. Of course if you're
just some normal person, the courts presume in favor of
Obliviation, not False Memory Charms. But the court has discretion,
and if <em>I'm</em> involved then it impinges on the honor of a
Noble House, so it goes to the Wizengamot, where Father has the
votes. After I'm found not guilty the Lovegood family has to pay
reparations for tarnishing my honor. And they know from the start
that's how it'll go, so they'll just keep their mouths shut."</p>
<p>A cold chill was coming over Harry, a chill that came with
instructions to keep his voice and face normal. <em>Note to self:
Overthrow government of magical Britain at earliest
convenience.</em></p>
<p>Harry coughed again to clear his throat. "Draco, please please
<em>please</em> don't take this the wrong way, my word is my bond,
but like you said I could be in Slytherin and I really want to ask
for informational purposes, so what would happen <em>theoretically
speaking</em> if I <em>did</em> testify that I'd heard you plan
it?"</p>
<p>"Then if I was anyone other than a Malfoy, I'd be in trouble,"
Draco answered smugly. "Since I <em>am</em> a Malfoy... Father has
the votes. And afterwards he'd crush you... well, I guess not
easily, since you <em>are</em> the Boy-Who-Lived, but Father is
pretty good at that sort of thing." Draco frowned. "'Sides,
<em>you</em> talked about murdering her, why weren't you worried
about <em>me</em> testifying after she turns up dead?"</p>
<p><em>How, oh how did my day go this wrong?</em> Harry's mouth was
already moving faster than he could think. "That's when I thought
she was <em>older!</em> I don't know how it works <em>here</em>,
but in Muggle Britain the courts would get a lot more upset about
someone killing a child -"</p>
<p>"That makes sense," Draco said, still looking a bit suspicious.
"But anyway, it's always smarter if it doesn't go to the Aurors at
all. If we're careful only to do things that Healing Charms can
fix, we can just Obliviate her afterwards and then do it all again
next week." Then the blonde-haired boy giggled, a youthful
high-pitched sound. "Though just imagine her saying she'd been done
by Draco Malfoy <em>and</em> the Boy-Who-Lived, not even
<em>Dumbledore</em> would believe her."</p>
<p><em>I am going to tear apart your pathetic little magical
remnant of the Dark Ages into pieces smaller than its constituent
atoms. "</em>Actually, can we hold off on that? After I found out
that headline came from a girl a year younger than me, I had a
different thought for my revenge."</p>
<p>"Huh? Do tell," Draco said, and started to take another swig of
his Comed-Tea.</p>
<p>Harry didn't know if the enchantment worked more than once per
can, but he <em>did</em> know he could avoid the blame, so he was
careful to time it exactly right:</p>
<p>"I was thinking <em>someday I'm going to marry that
woman.</em>"</p>
<p>Draco made a horrid ker-splutching sound and leaked green fluid
out the corners of his mouth like a broken car radiator. "<em>Are
you nuts?</em> "</p>
<p>"Quite the opposite, I'm so sane it burns like ice."</p>
<p>"You've got weirder taste than a Lestrange," Draco said,
sounding half-admiring about it. "And I suppose you want her all to
yourself, huh?"</p>
<p>"Yep. I can owe you a favor for it -"</p>
<p>Draco waved it off. "Nah, this one's free."</p>
<p>Harry stared down at the can in his hand, the coldness settling
into his blood. Charming, happy, generous with his favors to his
friends, Draco wasn't a psychopath. That was the sad and awful
part, knowing human psychology well enough to <em>know</em> that
Draco <em>wasn't</em> a monster. There had been ten thousand
societies over the history of the world where this conversation
could have happened. No, the world would have been a very different
place indeed, if it took an <em>evil</em> <em>mutant</em> to say
what Draco had said. It was very simple, very human, it was the
default if nothing else intervened. To Draco, his enemies weren't
people.</p>
<p>And in the slowed time of this slowed country, here and now as
in the darkness-before-dawn prior to the Age of Reason, the son of
a sufficiently powerful noble would simply take for granted that he
was above the law, at least when it came to some peasant girl.
There were places in Muggle-land where it was still the same way,
countries where that sort of nobility still existed and still
thought like that, or even grimmer lands where it wasn't just the
nobility. It was like that in every place and time that didn't
descend directly from the Enlightenment. A line of descent, it
seemed, which didn't quite include magical Britain, for all that
there had been cross-cultural contamination of things like
ring-pull drinks cans.</p>
<p><em>And if Draco doesn't change his mind about wanting revenge,
and I don't throw away my own chance at happiness in life to marry
some poor crazy girl, then all I've just bought is time, and not
too much of it...</em></p>
<p>For one girl. Not for others.</p>
<p><em>I wonder how difficult it would be to just make a list of
all the top blood purists and kill them.</em></p>
<p>They'd tried exactly that during the French Revolution, more or
less - make a list of all the enemies of Progress and remove
everything above the neck - and it hadn't worked out well from what
Harry recalled. Maybe he needed to dust off some of those history
books his father had bought him, and see if what had gone wrong
with the French Revolution was something easy to fix.</p>
<p>Harry gazed up at the sky, and at the pale shape of the Moon,
visible this morning through the cloudless air.</p>
<p><em>So the world is broken and flawed and insane, and cruel and
bloody and dark. This is news? You always knew that,
anyway...</em></p>
<p>"You're looking all serious," Draco said. "Let me guess, your
Muggle parents told you that this sort of thing was bad."</p>
<p>Harry nodded, not quite trusting his voice.</p>
<p>"Well, like Father says, there may be four houses, but in the
end everyone belongs to either Slytherin or Hufflepuff. And
frankly, you're not on the Hufflepuff end. If you decide to side
with the Malfoys under the table... our power and your
reputation... you could get away with things even <em>I</em> can't
do. Want to <em>try</em> it for a while? See what it's like?"</p>
<p><em>Aren't we a clever little serpent. Eleven years old and
already coaxing your prey from hiding...</em></p>
<p>Harry thought, considered, chose his weapon. "Draco, you want to
explain the whole blood purity thing to me? I'm sort of new."</p>
<p>A wide smile crossed Draco's face. "You really should meet
Father and ask <em>him</em>, you know, he's our leader."</p>
<p>"Give me the thirty-second version."</p>
<p>"Okay," Draco said. He drew in a deep breath, and his voice grew
slightly lower, and took on a cadence. "Our powers have grown
weaker, generation by generation, as the mudblood taint increases.
Where Salazar and Godric and Rowena and Helga once raised Hogwarts
by their power, creating the Locket and the Sword and the Diadem
and the Cup, no wizard of these faded days has risen to rival them.
We are fading, all fading into Muggles as we interbreed with their
spawn and allow our Squibs to live. If the taint is not checked,
soon our wands will break and all our arts cease, the line of
Merlin will end and the blood of Atlantis fail. Our children will
be left scratching at the dirt to survive like the mere Muggles,
and darkness will cover all the world for ever." Draco took another
swig from his drinks can, looking satisfied; that seemed to be the
whole argument as far as he was concerned.</p>
<p>"Persuasive," Harry said, meaning it descriptively rather than
normatively. It was a standard pattern: The Fall from Grace, the
need to guard what purity remained against contamination, the past
sloping upwards and the future sloping only down. And that pattern
also had its <em>counter</em>... "I have to correct you on one
point of fact, though. Your information about the Muggles is a bit
out of date. We aren't exactly scratching at the dirt anymore."</p>
<p>Draco's head snapped around. "<em>What?</em> What do you mean,
<em>we?</em> "</p>
<p>"We. The scientists. The line of Francis Bacon and the blood of
the Enlightenment. Muggles didn't just sit around crying about not
having wands, we have our <em>own</em> powers now, with or without
magic. If all your powers fail then we will all have lost something
very precious, because your magic is the only hint we have as to
how the universe must <em>really</em> work - but you won't be left
scratching at the ground. Your houses will still be cool in summer
and warm in winter, there will still be doctors and medicine.
Science can keep you alive if magic fails. It'd be a tragedy, but
not literally the end of all the light in the world. Just
saying."</p>
<p>Draco had backed up several feet and his face was full of mixed
fear and disbelief. "<em>What in the name of Merlin are you talking
about, Potter?</em> "</p>
<p>"Hey, I listened to <em>your</em> story, won't you listen to
mine?" <em>Clumsy,</em> Harry chided himself, but Draco actually
did stop backing off and seem to listen.</p>
<p>"Anyway," Harry said, "I'm saying that you don't seem to have
been paying much attention to what goes on in the Muggle world."
Probably because the whole wizarding world seemed to regard the
rest of Earth as a slum, deserving around as much news coverage as
the <em>Financial Times</em> awarded to the routine agonies of
Burundi. "All right. Quick check. Have wizards ever been to the
Moon? You know, that thing?" Harry pointed up to that huge and
distant globe.</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " Draco said. It was pretty clear the thought
had never occured to the boy. "<em>Go</em> to the - it's just a -"
His finger pointed at the little pale thingy in the sky. "You can't
Apparate to somewhere you've never <em>been</em> and how would
anyone get to the Moon in the <em>first</em> place?"</p>
<p>"Hold on," Harry said to Draco, "I'd like to show you a book I
brought with me, I think I remember what box it's in." And Harry
stood up and kneeled down and yanked out the stairs to the cavern
level of his trunk, then tore down the stairs and heaved a box off
another box, coming perilously close to treating his books with
disrespect, and snatched off the box cover and quickly but
carefully pried out a stack of books -</p>
<p>(Harry had inherited the nigh-magical Verres ability to remember
where all his books were, even after seeing them just once, which
was rather mysterious considering the lack of any genetic
connection.)</p>
<p>And Harry raced back up the stairs and shoved the staircase back
into the trunk with his heel, and, panting, turned the pages of the
book until he found the picture he wanted to show to Draco.</p>
<p>The one with the white, dry, cratered land, and the suited
people, and the blue-white globe hanging over it all.</p>
<p>That picture.</p>
<p><em>The</em> picture, if only one picture in all the world were
to survive.</p>
<p>"<em>That</em>," Harry said, his voice trembling because he
couldn't quite keep the pride out, "is what the Earth looks like
from the Moon."</p>
<p>Draco slowly leaned over. There was a strange expression on his
young face. "If that's a <em>real</em> picture, why isn't it
moving?"</p>
<p><em>Moving?</em> Oh. "Muggles can do moving pictures but they
need a bigger box to show it, they can't fit them onto single book
pages yet."</p>
<p>Draco's finger moved to one of the suits. "What are those?" His
voice starting to waver.</p>
<p>"Those are human beings. They are wearing suits that cover their
whole bodies to give them air, because there is no air on the
Moon."</p>
<p>"That's impossible," Draco whispered. There was terror in his
eyes, and utter confusion. "No Muggle could ever do that.
<em>How...</em>"</p>
<p>Harry took back the book, flipped the pages until he found what
he saw. "This is a rocket going up. The fire pushes it higher and
higher, until it gets to the Moon." Flipped pages again. "This is a
rocket on the ground. That tiny speck next to it is a person."
Draco gasped. "Going to the Moon cost the equivalent of... probably
around a thousand million Galleons." Draco choked. "And it took the
efforts of... probably more people than live in all of magical
Britain." <em>And when they arrived, they left a plaque that said,
'We came in peace, for all mankind.' Though you're not yet ready to
hear those words, Draco Malfoy...</em></p>
<p>"You're telling the truth," Draco said slowly. "You wouldn't
fake a whole book just for this - and I can hear it in your voice.
But... but..."</p>
<p>"How, without wands or magic? It's a long story, Draco. Science
doesn't work by waving wands and chanting spells, it works by
knowing how the universe works on such a deep level that you know
exactly what to do in order to make the universe do what you want.
If magic is like casting <em>Imperio</em> on someone to make them
do what you want, then science is like knowing them so well that
you can convince them it was their own idea all along. It's a lot
more difficult than waving a wand, but it works when wands fail,
just like if the <em>Imperius</em> failed you could still try
persuading a person. And Science builds from generation to
generation. You have to really <em>know</em> what you're doing to
do science - and when you really understand something, you can
explain it to someone else. The greatest scientists of one century
ago, the brightest names that are still spoken with reverence,
their powers are as <em>nothing</em> to the greatest scientists of
today. There is no equivalent in science of your lost arts that
raised Hogwarts. In science our powers wax by the year. And we are
beginning to understand and unravel the secrets of life and
inheritance. We'll be able to look at the very blood of which you
spoke, and see what makes you a wizard, and in one or two more
generations, we'll be able to persuade that blood to make all your
children powerful wizards too. So you see, your problem isn't
nearly as bad as it looks, because in a few more decades, science
will be able to solve it for you."</p>
<p>"But..." Draco said. His voice was trembling. "If
<em>Muggles</em> have that kind of power... then... what are
<em>we?</em> "</p>
<p>"No, Draco, that's not it, don't you see? Science taps the power
of human understanding to look at the world and figure out how it
works. It can't fail without humanity itself failing. Your magic
could turn off, and you would hate that, but you would still be
<em>you</em>. You would still be alive to regret it. But because
science rests upon my human intelligence, it is the power that
cannot be removed from me without removing <em>me.</em> Even if the
laws of the universe change on me, so that all my knowledge is
void, I'll just figure out the new laws, as has been done before.
It's not a <em>Muggle</em> thing, it's a <em>human</em> thing, it
just refines and trains the power you use every time you look at
something you don't understand and ask 'Why?' You're of Slytherin,
Draco, don't you see the implication?"</p>
<p>Draco looked up from the book to Harry. His face showed dawning
understanding. "Wizards can learn to use this power."</p>
<p>Very carefully, now... the bait is set, now the hook... "If you
can learn to think of yourself as a <em>human</em> instead of a
<em>wizard</em> then you can train and refine your powers as a
human."</p>
<p>And if <em>that</em> instruction wasn't in <em>every</em>
science curriculum, Draco didn't need to know it, did he?</p>
<p>Draco's eyes were now thoughtful. "You've... already done
this?"</p>
<p>"To some extent," Harry allowed. "My training isn't complete.
Not at eleven. But - my father <em>also</em> bought me tutors, you
see." Sure, they'd been starving grad students, and it had only
been because Harry slept on a 26-hour cycle, but leave all that
aside for now...</p>
<p>Slowly, Draco nodded. "You think you can master <em>both</em>
arts, add the powers together, and..." Draco stared at Harry. "Make
yourself Lord of the two worlds?"</p>
<p>Harry gave an evil laugh, it just seemed to come naturally at
that point. "You have to realise, Draco, that the whole world you
know, all of magical Britain, is just one square on a much larger
gameboard. The gameboard that includes places like the Moon, and
the stars in the night sky, which are lights just like the Sun only
unimaginably far away, and things like galaxies that are vastly
huger than the Earth and Sun, things so large that only scientists
can see them and you don't even know they exist. But I really
<em>am</em> Ravenclaw, you know, not Slytherin. I don't want to
rule the universe. I just think it could be more sensibly
organised."</p>
<p>There was awe on Draco's face. "Why are you telling <em>me</em>
this?"</p>
<p>"Oh... there aren't many people who know how to do <em>true</em>
science - understanding something for the very first time, even if
it confuses the hell out of you. Help would be helpful."</p>
<p>Draco stared at Harry with his mouth open.</p>
<p>"But make no mistake, Draco, true science really <em>isn't</em>
like magic, you can't just do it and walk away unchanged like
learning how to say the words of a new spell. The power comes with
a cost, a cost so high that most people refuse to pay it."</p>
<p>Draco nodded at this as though, finally, he'd heard something he
could understand. "And that cost?"</p>
<p>"Learning to admit you're wrong."</p>
<p>"Um," Draco said after the dramatic pause had stretched on for a
while. "You going to explain that?"</p>
<p>"Trying to figure out how something works on that deep level,
the first ninety-nine explanations you come up with are wrong. The
hundredth is right. So you have to learn how to admit you're wrong,
over and over and over again. It doesn't sound like much, but it's
so hard that most people can't do science. Always questioning
yourself, always taking another look at things you've always taken
for granted," like having a Snitch in Quidditch, "and every time
you change your mind, you change yourself. But I'm getting way
ahead of myself here. Way ahead of myself. I just want you to
know... I'm offering to share some of my knowledge. If you want.
There's just one condition."</p>
<p>"Uh huh," Draco said. "You know, Father says that when someone
says that to you, it is never a good sign, ever."</p>
<p>Harry nodded. "Now, don't mistake me and think that I'm trying
to drive a wedge between you and your father. It's not about that.
It's just about me wanting to deal with someone my own age, rather
than having this be between me and Lucius. I think your father
would be okay with that too, he knows you have to grow up sometime.
But your moves in our game have to be your own. That's my condition
- that I'm dealing with you, Draco, not your father."</p>
<p>"I've got to go," Draco said. He stood up. "I've got to go off
and think about this."</p>
<p>"Take your time," Harry said.</p>
<p>The sounds of the train platform changed from blurs into murmurs
as Draco wandered off.</p>
<p>Harry slowly exhaled the air he'd been holding in without quite
realising it, and then looked at the watch on his wrist, a simple
mechanical model that his father had bought him in hope it would
work in magic's presence. The second-hand was still ticking, and if
the minute hand was right, then it wasn't quite eleven just yet. He
probably ought to get on the train soon and start looking for
whatsherface, but it seemed worth taking a few minutes first to do
some breathing exercises and see if his blood warmed up again.</p>
<p>But when Harry looked up from his watch, he saw two figures
approaching, looking utterly ridiculous with their faces cloaked by
winter scarves.</p>
<p>"Hello, Mr. Bronze," said one of the masked figures. "Can we
interest you in joining the Order of Chaos?"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Aftermath:</em></p>
<p>Not too long after that, when all that day's fuss had finally
subsided, Draco was bent over a desk with quill in hand. He had a
private room in the Slytherin dungeons, with its own desk and its
own fire - sadly not even <em>he</em> rated a connection to the
Floo system, but at least Slytherin didn't buy into that utter
nonsense about making <em>everyone</em> sleep in dorms. There
weren't many private rooms, you had to be the <em>very</em> best
within the House of the better sort, but that could be taken for
granted with the House of Malfoy.</p>
<p><em>Dear Father,</em> Draco wrote.</p>
<p>And then he stopped.</p>
<p>Ink slowly dripped from his quill, staining the parchment near
the words.</p>
<p>Draco wasn't stupid. He was young, but his tutors had trained
him well. Draco knew that Potter probably felt a lot more sympathy
towards Dumbledore's faction than Potter was letting on... though
Draco did think Potter could be tempted. But it was crystal clear
that Potter was trying to tempt Draco just as Draco was trying to
tempt him.</p>
<p>And it was also clear that Potter was brilliant, and a whole lot
more than just slightly mad, and playing a vast game that Potter
himself mostly didn't understand, improvised at top speed with the
subtlety of a rampaging nundu. But Potter had managed to choose a
tactic that Draco couldn't just walk away from. He had offered
Draco a part of his own power, gambling that Draco couldn't use it
without becoming more like him. His father had called this an
advanced technique, and had warned Draco that it often didn't
work.</p>
<p>Draco knew he hadn't understood everything that had happened...
but Potter had offered <em>him</em> the chance to play and right
now it was <em>his.</em> And if he blurted the whole thing out, it
would become Father's.</p>
<p>In the end it was as simple as that. The lesser techniques
require the unawareness of the target, or at least their
uncertainty. Flattery has to be plausibly disguised as admiration.
("You should have been in Slytherin" is an old classic, highly
effective on a certain type of person who isn't expecting it, and
if it works you can repeat it.) But when you find someone's
ultimate lever it doesn't matter if they know you know. Potter, in
his mad rush, had guessed a key to Draco's soul. And if Draco knew
that Potter knew it - even if it had been an obvious sort of guess
- that didn't change anything.</p>
<p>So now, for the first time in his life, he had real secrets to
keep. He was playing his own game. There was an obscure pain to it,
but he knew that Father would be proud, and that made it all
right.</p>
<p>Leaving the ink drippings in place - there was a message there,
and one that his father would understand, for they had played the
game of subtleties more than once - Draco wrote out the one
question that really had gnawed at him about the whole affair, the
part that it seemed he <em>ought</em> to understand, but he didn't,
not at all.</p>
<p><em>Dear Father:</em></p>
<p><em>Suppose I told you that I met a student at Hogwarts, not
already part of our circle of acquaintances, who called you a
'flawless instrument of death' and said that I was your 'one weak
point'. What would you say about him?</em></p>
<p>It didn't take long after that for the family owl to bring the
reply.</p>
<p><em>My beloved son:</em></p>
<p><em>I would say that you had been so fortunate as to meet
someone who enjoys the intimate confidence of our friend and
valuable ally, Severus Snape.</em></p>
<p>Draco stared at the letter for a while, and finally threw it
into the fire.</p>

<p>No one had asked for help, that was the problem. They'd just
gone around talking, eating, or staring into the air while their
parents exchanged gossip. For whatever odd reason, no one had been
sitting down reading a book, which meant she couldn't just sit down
next to them and take out her own book. And even when she'd boldly
taken the initiative by sitting down and continuing her third
read-through of <em>Hogwarts: A History,</em> no one had seemed
inclined to sit down next to her.</p>
<p>Aside from helping people with their homework, or anything else
they needed, she really didn't know how to meet people. She didn't
<em>feel</em> like she was a shy person. She thought of herself as
a take-charge sort of girl. And yet, somehow, if there wasn't some
request along the lines of "I can't remember how to do long
division" then it was just too <em>awkward</em> to go up to someone
and say... what? She'd never been able to figure out what. And
there didn't seem to be a standard information sheet, which was
ridiculous. The whole business of meeting people had never seemed
sensible to her. Why did <em>she</em> have to take all the
responsibility herself when there were two people involved? Why
didn't adults ever help? She wished some other girl would just walk
up to <em>her</em> and say, "Hermione, the teacher told me to be
friends with you."</p>
<p>But let it be quite clear that Hermione Granger, sitting alone
on the first day of school in one of the few compartments that had
been empty, in the last carriage of the train, with the compartment
door left open just in case anyone for any reason wanted to talk to
her, was <em>not</em> sad, lonely, gloomy, depressed, despairing,
or obsessing about her problems. She was, rather, rereading
<em>Hogwarts: A History</em> for the third time and quite enjoying
it, with only a faint tinge of annoyance in the back of her mind at
the general unreasonableness of the world.</p>
<p>There was the sound of an inter-train door opening, and then
footsteps and an odd slithering sound coming down the hallway of
the train. Hermione laid aside <em>Hogwarts: A History</em> and
stood up and stuck her head outside - just in case someone needed
help - and saw a young boy in a wizard's dress robes, probably
first or second year going by his height, and looking quite silly
with a scarf wrapped around his head. A small trunk stood on the
floor next to him. Even as she saw him, he knocked on the door of
another, closed compartment, and he said in a voice only slightly
muffled by the scarf, "Excuse me, can I ask a quick question?"</p>
<p>She didn't hear the answer from inside the compartment, but
after the boy opened the door, she did think she heard him say -
unless she'd somehow misheard - "Does anyone here know the six
quarks or where I can find a first-year girl named Hermione
Granger?"</p>
<p>After the boy had closed that compartment door, Hermione said,
"Can I help you with something?"</p>
<p>The scarfed face turned to look at her, and the voice said, "Not
unless you can name the six quarks or tell me where to find
Hermione Granger."</p>
<p>"Up, down, strange, charm, truth, beauty, and why are you
looking for her?"</p>
<p>It was hard to tell from this distance, but she thought she saw
the boy grin widely under his scarf. "Ah, so <em>you're</em> a
first-year girl named Hermione Granger," said that young, muffled
voice. "On the train to Hogwarts, no less." The boy started to walk
towards her and her compartment, and his trunk slithered along
after him. "Technically, all I needed to do was <em>look</em> for
you, but it seems likely that I'm meant to talk to you or invite
you to join my party or get a key magical item from you or find out
that Hogwarts was built over the ruins of an ancient temple or
something. PC or NPC, that is the question?"</p>
<p>Hermione opened her mouth to reply to this, but then she
couldn't think of any <em>possible</em> reply to...
<em>whatever</em> it was she'd just heard, even as the boy walked
over to her, looked inside the compartment, nodded with
satisfaction, and sat down on the bench across from her own. His
trunk scurried in after him, grew to three times its former
diameter and snuggled up next to her own in an oddly disturbing
fashion.</p>
<p>"Please, have a seat," said the boy, "and do please close the
door behind you, if you would. Don't worry, I don't bite anyone who
doesn't bite me first." He was already unwinding the scarf from
around his head.</p>
<p>The imputation that this boy thought she was <em>scared</em> of
him made her hand send the door sliding shut, jamming it into the
wall with unnecessary force. She spun around and saw a young face
with bright, laughing green eyes, and an angry red-dark scar set
into his forehead that reminded her of something in the back of her
mind but right now she had more important things to think about. "I
didn't say I was Hermione Granger!"</p>
<p>"<em>I</em> didn't say you <em>said</em> you were Hermione
Granger, I just said you were Hermione Granger. If you're asking
how I know, it's because I know everything. Good evening ladies and
gentlemen, my name is Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres or Harry
Potter for short, I know that probably doesn't mean anything to
<em>you</em> for a change -"</p>
<p>Hermione's mind finally made the connection. The scar on his
forehead, the shape of a lightning bolt. "Harry Potter! You're in
<em>Modern Magical History</em> and <em>The Rise and Fall of the
Dark Arts</em> and <em>Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth
Century.</em>" It was actually the very first time in her whole
life that she'd <em>met</em> someone from inside a <em>book,</em>
and it was a rather odd feeling.</p>
<p>The boy blinked three times. "I'm in <em>books</em>? Wait, of
course I'm in books... what a strange thought."</p>
<p>"Goodness, didn't you know?" said Hermione. "I'd have found out
everything I could if it was me."</p>
<p>The boy spoke rather dryly. "Miss Granger, it has been less than
72 hours since I went to Diagon Alley and discovered my claim to
fame. I have spent the last two days buying science books.
<em>Believe me,</em> I intend to find out everything I can." The
boy hesitated. "What <em>do</em> the books say about me?"</p>
<p>Hermione Granger's mind flashed back, she hadn't realised she
would be tested on <em>those</em> books so she'd read them only
once, but it was just a month ago so the material was still fresh
in her mind. "You're the only one who's survived the Killing Curse
so you're called the Boy-Who-Lived. You were born to James Potter
and Lily Potter formerly Lily Evans on the 31st of July 1980. On
the 31st of October 1981 the Dark Lord He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
though I don't know why not attacked your home. You were found
alive with the scar on your forehead in the ruins of your parents'
house near the burnt remains of You-Know-Who's body. Chief Warlock
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore sent you off somewhere, no
one knows where. <em>The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts</em> claims
that you survived because of your mother's love and that your scar
contains all of the Dark Lord's magical power and that the centaurs
fear you, but <em>Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth
Century</em> doesn't mention anything like that and <em>Modern
Magical History</em> warns that there are lots of crackpot theories
about you."</p>
<p>The boy's mouth was hanging open. "Were you told to wait for
Harry Potter on the train to Hogwarts, or something like that?"</p>
<p>"No," Hermione said. "Who told you about <em>me?</em> "</p>
<p>"Professor McGonagall and I believe I see why. Do you have an
eidetic memory, Hermione?"</p>
<p>Hermione shook her head. "It's not photographic, I've always
wished it was but I had to read my school books five times over to
memorize them all."</p>
<p>"Really," the boy said in a slightly strangled voice. "I hope
you don't mind if I test that - it's not that I don't believe you,
but as the saying goes, 'Trust, but verify'. No point in wondering
when I can just do the experiment."</p>
<p>Hermione smiled, rather smugly. She so loved tests. "Go
ahead."</p>
<p>The boy stuck a hand into a pouch at his side and said "Magical
Drafts and Potions by Arsenius Jigger". When he withdrew his hand
it was holding the book he'd named.</p>
<p>Instantly Hermione wanted one of those pouches more than she'd
ever wanted anything.</p>
<p>The boy opened the book to somewhere in the middle and looked
down. "If you were making <em>oil of sharpness</em> -"</p>
<p>"I can <em>see</em> that page from here, you know!"</p>
<p>The boy tilted the book so that she couldn't see it any more,
and flipped the pages again. "If you were brewing a <em>potion of
spider climbing,</em> what would be the next ingredient you added
after the Acromantula silk?"</p>
<p>"After dropping in the silk, wait until the potion has turned
exactly the shade of the cloudless dawn sky, 8 degrees from the
horizon and 8 minutes before the tip of the sun first becomes
visible. Stir eight times widdershins and once deasil, and then add
eight drams of unicorn bogies."</p>
<p>The boy shut the book with a sharp snap and put the book back
into his pouch, which swallowed it with a small burping noise.
"Well well well <em>well</em> well well. I should like to make you
a proposition, Miss Granger."</p>
<p>"A proposition?" Hermione said suspiciously. Girls weren't
supposed to listen to those.</p>
<p>It was also at this point that Hermione realised the other thing
- well, one of the things - which was odd about the boy. Apparently
people who were <em>in</em> books actually <em>sounded</em> like a
book when they talked. This was quite the surprising discovery.</p>
<p>The boy reached into his pouch and said, "can of pop",
retrieving a bright green cylinder. He held it out to her and said,
"Can I offer you something to drink?"</p>
<p>Hermione politely accepted the fizzy drink. In fact she
<em>was</em> feeling sort of thirsty by now. "Thank you very much,"
Hermione said as she popped the top. "Was that your
proposition?"</p>
<p>The boy coughed. "No," he said. Just as Hermione started to
drink, he said, "I'd like you to help me take over the
universe."</p>
<p>Hermione finished her drink and lowered the can. "No thank you,
I'm not evil."</p>
<p>The boy looked at her in surprise, as though he'd been expecting
some other answer. "Well, I was speaking a bit rhetorically," he
said. "In the sense of the Baconian project, you know, not
political power. 'The effecting of all things possible' and so on.
I want to conduct experimental studies of spells, figure out the
underlying laws, bring magic into the domain of science, merge the
wizarding and Muggle worlds, raise the entire planet's standard of
living, move humanity centuries ahead, discover the secret of
immortality, colonize the Solar System, explore the galaxy, and
most importantly, figure out what the heck is really going on here
because all of this is blatantly impossible."</p>
<p>That sounded a bit more interesting. "And?"</p>
<p>The boy stared at her incredulously. "<em>And?</em> That's not
<em>enough?</em> "</p>
<p>"And what do you want from me?" said Hermione.</p>
<p>"I want you to help me do the research, of course. With your
encyclopedic memory added to my intelligence and rationality, we'll
have the Baconian project finished in no time, where by 'no time' I
mean probably at least thirty-five years."</p>
<p>Hermione was beginning to find this boy annoying. "I haven't
seen you do anything intelligent. Maybe I'll let <em>you</em> help
me with <em>my</em> research."</p>
<p>There was a certain silence in the compartment.</p>
<p>"So you're asking me to demonstrate my intelligence, then," said
the boy after a long pause.</p>
<p>Hermione nodded.</p>
<p>"I warn you that challenging my ingenuity is a dangerous
project, and tends to make your life a lot more surreal."</p>
<p>"I'm not impressed yet," Hermione said. Unnoticed, the green
drink once again rose to her lips.</p>
<p>"Well, maybe <em>this</em> will impress you," the boy said. He
leaned forward and looked at her intensely. "I've already done a
bit of experimenting and I found out that I don't need the wand, I
can make anything I want happen just by snapping my fingers."</p>
<p>It came just as Hermione was in the middle of swallowing, and
she choked and coughed and expelled the bright green fluid.</p>
<p>Onto her brand new, never-worn witch's robes, on the very first
day of school.</p>
<p>Hermione actually screamed. It was a high-pitched sound that
sounded like an air raid siren in the closed compartment. "<em>Eek!
My clothes!</em> "</p>
<p>"Don't panic!" said the boy. "I can fix it for you. Just watch!"
He raised a hand and snapped his fingers.</p>
<p>"You'll -" Then she looked down at herself.</p>
<p>The green fluid was still there, but even as she watched, it
started to vanish and fade and within just a few moments, it was
like she'd never spilled anything at herself.</p>
<p>Hermione stared at the boy, who was wearing a rather smug sort
of smile.</p>
<p>Wordless wandless magic! At <em>his</em> age? When he'd only
gotten the schoolbooks <em>three days</em> ago?</p>
<p>Then she remembered what she'd read, and she gasped and flinched
back from him. <em>All the Dark Lord's magical power! In his
scar!</em></p>
<p>She rose hastily to her feet. "I, I, I need to go the toilet,
wait here all right -" she had to find a grownup she had to tell
them -</p>
<p>The boy's smile faded. "It was just a trick, Hermione. I'm
sorry, I didn't mean to scare you."</p>
<p>Her hand halted on the door handle. "A <em>trick?</em> "</p>
<p>"Yes," said the boy. "You asked me to demonstrate my
intelligence. So I did something apparently impossible, which is
always a good way to show off. I can't <em>really</em> do anything
just by snapping my fingers." The boy paused. "At least I don't
<em>think</em> I can, I've never actually tested it
experimentally." The boy raised his hand and snapped his fingers
again. "Nope, no banana."</p>
<p>Hermione was as confused as she'd ever been in her life.</p>
<p>The boy was now smiling again at the look on her face. "I did
<em>warn</em> you that challenging my ingenuity tends to make your
life surreal. Do remember this the next time I warn you about
something."</p>
<p>"But, but," Hermione stammered. "What did you <em>do,</em>
then?"</p>
<p>The boy's gaze took on a measuring, weighing quality that she'd
never seen before from someone her own age. "You think you have
what it takes to be a scientist in your own right, with or without
my help? Then let's see how <em>you</em> investigate a confusing
phenomenon."</p>
<p>"I..." Hermione's mind went blank for a moment. She loved tests
but she'd never had a test like <em>this</em> before. Frantically,
she tried to cast back for anything she'd read about what
scientists were supposed to do. Her mind skipped gears, ground
against itself, and spat back the instructions for doing a science
investigation project:</p>
<p><em>Step 1: Form a hypothesis.<br>
Step 2: Do an experiment to test your hypothesis.<br>
Step 3: Measure the results.</em><em><br>
Step 4: Make a cardboard poster.</em></p>
<p>Step 1 was to form a hypothesis. That meant, try to think of
something that <em>could</em> have happened just now. "All right.
My hypothesis is that you cast a Charm on my robes to make anything
spilled on it vanish."</p>
<p>"All right," said the boy, "is that your answer?"</p>
<p>The shock was wearing off, and Hermione's mind was starting to
work properly. "Wait, that can't be right. I didn't see you touch
your wand or say any spells so how could you have cast a
Charm?"</p>
<p>The boy waited, his face neutral.</p>
<p>"But suppose all the robes come from the store with a Charm
<em>already</em> on them to keep them clean, which would be a
useful sort of Charm for them to have. You found that out by
spilling something on <em>yourself</em> earlier."</p>
<p>Now the boy's eyebrows lifted. "Is <em>that</em> your
answer?"</p>
<p>"No, I haven't done Step 2, 'Do an experiment to test your
hypothesis.'"</p>
<p>The boy closed his mouth again, and began to smile.</p>
<p>Hermione looked at the drinks can, which she'd automatically put
into the cupholder at the window. She took it up and peered inside,
and found that it was around one-third full.</p>
<p>"Well," said Hermione, "the experiment I want to do is to pour
it on my robes and see what happens, and my prediction is that the
stain will disappear. Only if it <em>doesn't</em> work, my robes
will be stained, and I don't want that."</p>
<p>"Do it to mine," said the boy, "that way you don't have to worry
about your robes getting stained."</p>
<p>"But -" Hermione said. There was something <em>wrong</em> with
that thinking but she didn't know how to say it exactly.</p>
<p>"I have spare robes in my trunk," said the boy.</p>
<p>"But there's nowhere for you to change," Hermione objected. Then
she thought better of it. "Though I suppose I could leave and close
the door -"</p>
<p>"I have somewhere to change in my trunk, too."</p>
<p>Hermione looked at his trunk, which, she was beginning to
suspect, was rather more special than her own.</p>
<p>"All right," Hermione said, "since you say so," and she rather
gingerly poured a bit of green pop onto a corner of the boy's
robes. Then she stared at it, trying to remember how long the
original fluid had taken to disappear...</p>
<p>And the green stain vanished!</p>
<p>Hermione let out a sigh of relief, not least because this meant
she wasn't dealing with all of the Dark Lord's magical power.</p>
<p>Well, Step 3 was measuring the results, but in this case that
was just seeing that the stain had vanished. And she supposed she
could probably skip Step 4, about the cardboard poster. "My answer
is that the robes are Charmed to keep themselves clean."</p>
<p>"Not quite," said the boy.</p>
<p>Hermione felt a stab of disappointment. She really wished she
<em>wouldn't</em> have felt that way, the boy wasn't a teacher, but
it was still a test and she'd gotten a question wrong and that
always felt like a little punch in the stomach.</p>
<p>(It said almost everything you needed to know about Hermione
Granger that she had never let that stop her, or even let it
interfere with her love of being tested.)</p>
<p>"The sad thing is," said the boy, "you probably did everything
the book told you to do. You made a prediction that would
distinguish between the robe being charmed and not charmed, and you
tested it, and rejected the null hypothesis that the robe was not
charmed. But unless you read the very, very best sort of books,
they won't quite teach you how to do science <em>properly</em>.
Well enough to <em>really</em> get the right answer, I mean, and
not just churn out another publication like Dad always complains
about. So let me try to explain - without giving away the answer -
what you did wrong this time, and I'll give you another
chance."</p>
<p>She was starting to resent the boy's oh-so-superior tone when he
was just another eleven-year-old like her, but that was secondary
to finding out what she'd done wrong. "All right."</p>
<p>The boy's expression grew more intense. "This is a game based on
a famous experiment called the 2-4-6 task, and this is how it
works. I have a <em>rule</em> - known to me, but not to you - which
fits some triplets of three numbers, but not others. 2-4-6 is one
example of a triplet which fits the rule. In fact... let me write
down the rule, just so you know it's a fixed rule, and fold it up
and give it to you. Please don't look, since I infer from earlier
that you can read upside-down."</p>
<p>The boy said "paper" and "mechanical pencil" to his pouch, and
she shut her eyes tightly while he wrote.</p>
<p>"There," said the boy, and he was holding a tightly folded piece
of paper. "Put this in your pocket," and she did.</p>
<p>"Now the way this game works," said the boy, "is that you give
me a triplet of three numbers, and I'll tell you 'Yes' if the three
numbers are an instance of the rule, and 'No' if they're not. I am
Nature, the rule is one of my laws, and you are investigating me.
You already know that 2-4-6 gets a 'Yes'. When you've performed all
the further experimental tests you want - asked me as many triplets
as you feel necessary - you stop and guess the rule, and then you
can unfold the sheet of paper and see how you did. Do you
understand the game?"</p>
<p>"Of course I do," said Hermione.</p>
<p>"Go."</p>
<p>"4-6-8" said Hermione.</p>
<p>"Yes," said the boy.</p>
<p>"10-12-14", said Hermione.</p>
<p>"Yes," said the boy.</p>
<p>Hermione tried to cast her mind a little further afield, since
it seemed like she'd already done all the testing she needed, and
yet it couldn't be that easy, could it?</p>
<p>"1-3-5."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Minus 3, minus 1, plus 1."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>Hermione couldn't think of anything else to do. "The rule is
that the numbers have to increase by two each time."</p>
<p>"Now suppose I tell you," said the boy, "that this test is
harder than it looks, and that only 20% of grownups get it
right."</p>
<p>Hermione frowned. What had she missed? Then, suddenly, she
thought of a test she still needed to do.</p>
<p>"2-5-8!" she said triumphantly.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"10-20-30!"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"The real answer is that the numbers have to go up by the
<em>same</em> amount each time. It doesn't have to be 2."</p>
<p>"Very well," said the boy, "take the paper out and see how you
did."</p>
<p>Hermione took the paper out of her pocket and unfolded it.</p>
<p><em>Three real numbers in increasing order, lowest to
highest.</em></p>
<p>Hermione's jaw dropped. She had the distinct feeling of
something terribly unfair having been done to her, that the boy was
a dirty rotten cheating liar, but when she cast her mind back she
couldn't think of any wrong responses that he'd given.</p>
<p>"What you've just discovered is called 'positive bias'," said
the boy. "You had a rule in your mind, and you kept on thinking of
triplets that should make the rule say 'Yes'. But you didn't try to
test any triplets that should make the rule say 'No'. In fact you
didn't get a <em>single</em> 'No', so 'any three numbers' could
have just as easily been the rule. It's sort of like how people
imagine experiments that could confirm their hypotheses instead of
trying to imagine experiments that could falsify them - that's not
quite exactly the same mistake but it's close. You have to learn to
look on the negative side of things, stare into the darkness. When
this experiment is performed, only 20% of grownups get the answer
right. And many of the others invent fantastically complicated
hypotheses and put great confidence in their wrong answers since
they've done so many experiments and everything came out like they
expected."</p>
<p>"Now," said the boy, "do you want to take another shot at the
original problem?"</p>
<p>His eyes were quite intent now, as though this were the
<em>real</em> test.</p>
<p>Hermione shut her eyes and tried to concentrate. She was
sweating underneath her robes. She had an odd feeling that this was
the hardest she'd ever been asked to think on a test or maybe even
the <em>first</em> time she'd ever been asked to think on a
test.</p>
<p>What other experiment could she do? She had a Chocolate Frog,
could she try to rub some of that on the robes and see if
<em>it</em> vanished? But that still didn't seem like the kind of
twisty negative thinking the boy was asking for. Like she was still
asking for a 'Yes' if the Chocolate Frog stain disappeared, rather
than asking for a 'No'.</p>
<p>So... on her hypothesis... when should the pop... <em>not</em>
vanish?</p>
<p>"I have an experiment to do," Hermione said. "I want to pour
some pop on the floor, and see if it <em>doesn't</em> vanish. Do
you have some paper towels in your pouch, so I can mop up the spill
if this doesn't work?"</p>
<p>"I have napkins," said the boy. His face still looked
neutral.</p>
<p>Hermione took the can, and poured a small bit of pop onto the
floor.</p>
<p>A few seconds later, it vanished.</p>
<p>Then the realisation hit her and she felt like kicking herself.
"Of course! <em>You</em> gave me that can! It's not the robe that's
enchanted, it was the pop all along!"</p>
<p>The boy stood up and bowed to her solemnly. He was grinning
widely now. "Then... may I help you with your research, Hermione
Granger?"</p>
<p>"I, ah..." Hermione was still feeling the rush of euphoria, but
she wasn't quite sure about how to answer <em>that.</em></p>
<p>They were interrupted by a weak, tentative, faint, rather
<em>reluctant</em> knocking at the door.</p>
<p>The boy turned and looked out the window, and said, "I'm not
wearing my scarf, so can you get that?"</p>
<p>It was at this point that Hermione realised why the boy - no,
the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry Potter - had been wearing the scarf over
his head in the first place, and felt a little silly for not
realising it earlier. It was actually sort of odd, since she would
have thought Harry Potter would proudly display himself to the
world; and the thought occurred to her that he might actually be
shyer than he seemed.</p>
<p>When Hermione pulled the door open, she was greeted by a
trembling young boy who looked exactly like he knocked.</p>
<p>"Excuse me," said the boy in a tiny voice, "I'm Neville
Longbottom. I'm looking for my pet toad, I, I can't seem to find it
anywhere on this carriage... have you seen my toad?"</p>
<p>"No," Hermione said, and then her helpfulness kicked in full
throttle. "Have you checked all the other compartments?"</p>
<p>"Yes," whispered the boy.</p>
<p>"Then we'll just have to check all the other carriages,"
Hermione said briskly. "I'll help you. My name is Hermione Granger,
by the way."</p>
<p>The boy looked like he might faint with gratitude.</p>
<p>"Hold on," came the voice of the <em>other</em> boy - Harry
Potter. "I'm not sure that's the best way to do it."</p>
<p>At this Neville looked like he might cry, and Hermione swung
around, angered. If Harry Potter was the sort of person who'd
abandon a little boy just because he didn't want to be
interrupted... "What? Why <em>not?</em> "</p>
<p>"Well," said Harry Potter, "It's going to take a while to check
the whole train by hand, and we might miss the toad anyway, and if
we didn't find it by the time we're at Hogwarts, he'd be in
trouble. So what would make a lot more sense is if he went directly
to the front carriage, where the prefects are, and asked a prefect
for help. That was the first thing I did when I was looking for
you, Hermione, although they didn't actually know. But they might
have spells or magic items that would make it a lot easier to find
a toad. We're only first-years."</p>
<p>That... <em>did</em> make a lot of sense.</p>
<p>"Do you think you can make it to the prefects' carriage on your
own?" asked Harry Potter. "I've sort of got reasons for not wanting
to show my face too much."</p>
<p>Suddenly Neville gasped and took a step back. "I remember that
voice! You're one of the Lords of Chaos! <em>You're the one who
gave me chocolate!</em> "</p>
<p>What? What what <em>what?</em></p>
<p>Harry Potter turned his head from the window and rose
dramatically. "I <em>never!</em> " he said, voice full of
indignation. "Do I look like the sort of villain who would give
sweets to a child?"</p>
<p>Neville's eyes widened. "<em>You're</em> Harry Potter?
<em>The</em> Harry Potter? <em>You?</em> "</p>
<p>"No, just <em>a</em> Harry Potter, there are three of me on this
train -"</p>
<p>Neville gave a small shriek and ran away. There was a brief
pattering of frantic footsteps and then the sound of a carriage
door opening and closing.</p>
<p>Hermione sat down hard on her bench. Harry Potter closed the
door and then sat down next to her.</p>
<p>"Can you please explain to me what's going on?" Hermione said in
a weak voice. She wondered if hanging around Harry Potter meant
always being this confused.</p>
<p>"Oh, well, what happened was that Fred and George and I saw this
poor small boy at the train station - the woman next to him had
gone away for a bit, and he was looking really frightened, like he
was sure he was about to be attacked by Death Eaters or something.
Now, there's a saying that the fear is often worse than the thing
itself, so it occurred to me that this was a lad who could actually
benefit from seeing his worst nightmare come true and that it
wasn't so bad as he feared -"</p>
<p>Hermione sat there with her mouth wide open.</p>
<p>"- and Fred and George came up with this spell to make the
scarves over our faces darken and blur, like we were undead kings
and those were our grave shrouds -"</p>
<p>She didn't like at all where this was going.</p>
<p>"- and after we were done giving him all the sweets I'd bought,
we were like, 'Let's give him some money! Ha ha ha! Have some
Knuts, boy! Have a silver Sickle!' and dancing around him and
laughing evilly and so on. I think there were some people in the
crowd who wanted to interfere at first, but bystander apathy held
them off at least until they saw what we were doing, and then I
think they were all too confused to do anything. Finally he said in
this tiny little whisper 'go away' so the three of us all screamed
and ran off, shrieking something about the light burning us.
Hopefully he won't be as scared of being bullied in the future.
That's called desensitisation therapy, by the way."</p>
<p>Okay, she <em>hadn't</em> guessed right about where this was
going.</p>
<p>The burning fire of indignation that was one of Hermione's
primary engines sputtered into life, even though part of her
<em>did</em> sort of see what they'd been trying to do. "That's
awful! <em>You're</em> awful! That poor boy! What you did was
<em>mean!</em> "</p>
<p>"I think the word you're looking for is <em>enjoyable,</em> and
in any case you're asking the wrong question. The question is, did
it do more good than harm, or more harm than good? If you have any
arguments to contribute to <em>that</em> question I'm glad to hear
them, but I won't entertain any other criticisms until that one is
settled. I certainly agree that what I did <em>looks</em> all
terrible and bullying and mean, since it involves a scared little
boy and so on, but that's hardly the key issue now is it? That's
called <em>consequentialism,</em> by the way, it means that whether
an act is right or wrong isn't determined by whether it
<em>looks</em> bad, or mean, or anything like that, the only
question is how it will turn out in the end - what are the
consequences."</p>
<p>Hermione opened her mouth to say something utterly
<em>searing</em> but unfortunately she seemed to have neglected the
part where she thought of something to say before opening her
mouth. All she could come up with was, "What if he has
<em>nightmares?</em> "</p>
<p>"Honestly, I don't think he needed our help to have nightmares,
and if he has nightmares about <em>this</em> instead, then it'll be
nightmares involving horrible monsters who give you chocolate and
that was sort of the whole <em>point</em>."</p>
<p>Hermione's brain kept hiccoughing in confusion every time she
tried to get properly angry. "Is your life always this peculiar?"
she said at last.</p>
<p>Harry Potter's face gleamed with pride. "I <em>make</em> it that
peculiar. You're looking at the product of a lot of hard work and
elbow grease."</p>
<p>"So..." Hermione said, and trailed off awkwardly.</p>
<p>"So," Harry Potter said, "how much science do you know exactly?
I can do calculus and I know some Bayesian probability theory and
decision theory and a lot of cognitive science, and I've read
<em>The Feynman Lectures</em> (or volume 1 anyway) and <em>Judgment
Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases</em> and <em>Language in
Thought and Action</em> and <em>Influence: Science and
Practice</em> and <em>Rational Choice in an Uncertain World</em>
and <em>Godel, Escher, Bach</em> and <em>A Step Farther Out</em>
and -"</p>
<p>The ensuing quiz and counter-quiz went on for several minutes
before being interrupted by another timid knock at the door. "Come
in," she and Harry Potter said at almost the same time, and it slid
back to reveal Neville Longbottom.</p>
<p>Neville <em>was</em> actually crying now. "I went to the front
carriage and found a p-prefect but he t-told me that prefects
weren't to be bothered over little things like m-missing
toads."</p>
<p>The Boy-Who-Lived's face changed. His lips set in a thin line.
His voice, when he spoke, was cold and grim. "What were his
colours? Green and silver?"</p>
<p>"N-no, his badge was r-red and gold."</p>
<p>"<em>Red and gold!</em> " burst out Hermione. "But those are
<em>Gryffindor's</em> colours!"</p>
<p>Harry Potter <em>hissed</em> at that, a frightening sort of
sound that could have come from a live snake and made both her and
Neville flinch. "I <em>suppose,"</em> Harry Potter spat, "that
finding some first-year's toad isn't <em>heroic</em> enough to be
worthy of a <em>Gryffindor</em> prefect. Come on, Neville,
<em>I'll</em> come with you this time, we'll see if the
Boy-Who-Lived gets more attention. First we'll find a prefect who
ought to know a spell, and if that doesn't work, we'll find a
prefect who isn't afraid of getting their hands dirty, and if
<em>that</em> doesn't work, I'll start recruiting my fans and if we
have to we'll take apart the whole train screw by screw."</p>
<p>The Boy-Who-Lived stood up and grabbed Neville's hand in his,
and Hermione realised with a sudden brain hiccough that they were
nearly the same size, even though some part of her had insisted
that Harry Potter was a foot taller than that, and Neville at least
six inches shorter.</p>
<p>"<em>Stay!</em> " Harry Potter snapped at her - no, wait, at his
<em>trunk</em> - and he closed the door behind him firmly as he
left.</p>
<p>She probably should have gone with them, but in just a brief
moment Harry Potter had turned so scary that she was actually
rather glad she hadn't thought to suggest it.</p>
<p>Hermione's mind was now so jumbled that she didn't even think
she could properly read "History: A Hogwarts". She felt as if she'd
just been run over by a steamroller and turned into a pancake. She
wasn't sure what she was thinking or what she was feeling or why.
She just sat by the window and stared at the moving scenery.</p>
<p>Well, she did at least know why she was feeling a little sad
inside.</p>
<p>Maybe Gryffindor wasn't as wonderful as she had thought.</p>

<p>Harry glanced over briefly at his new House-mate, more to get a
quick look at the face than anything else. He was still trying to
get himself under control from his encounter with the ghosts. The
sad, the really sad, the really truly sad thing was that he
<em>did</em> seem to be getting himself under control again. It
seemed ill-fitting. Like he should have taken at least a day. Maybe
a whole lifetime. Maybe just never.</p>
<p>"Corner, Michael!"</p>
<p>Long pause.</p>
<p>"RAVENCLAW!"</p>
<p>At the lectern before the huge Head Table stood Professor
McGonagall, looking sharp and looking sharply around, as she called
out one name after another, though she had smiled only for Hermione
and a few others. Behind her, in the tallest chair at the table -
really more of a golden throne - sat a wizened and bespectacled
ancient, with a silver-white beard that looked like it would go
almost to the floor if it were visible, watching over the Sorting
with a benevolent expression; as stereotypical in appearance as a
Wise Old Man could possibly be, without actually being Oriental.
(Though Harry had learned to be wary of stereotypical appearances
from the first time he'd met Professor McGonagall and thought that
she ought to cackle.) The ancient wizard had applauded every
student Sorted, with an unwavering smile that somehow seemed
freshly delighted for each.</p>
<p>To the golden throne's left side was a man with sharp eyes and a
dour face who had applauded no-one, and who somehow managed to be
looking straight back at Harry every time Harry looked at him.
Further to the left, the pale-faced man Harry had seen in the Leaky
Cauldron, whose eyes darted around as though in panic at the
surrounding crowd, and who seemed to occasionally jerk and twitch
in his seat; for some reason Harry kept finding himself staring at
him. To that man's left, a string of three older witches who didn't
seem much interested in the students. Then to the right side of the
tall golden chair, a round-faced middle-aged witch with a yellow
hat, who had applauded every student except the Slytherins. A tiny
man standing on his chair, with a poofy white beard, who had
applauded every student, but smiled only upon the Ravenclaws. And
on the farthest right, occupying the same space as three lesser
beings, the mountainous entity who'd greeted them all after they'd
disembarked from the train, naming himself Hagrid, Keeper of Keys
and Grounds.</p>
<p>"Is the man standing on his chair the Head of Ravenclaw?" Harry
whispered towards Hermione.</p>
<p>For once Hermione didn't answer this instantly; she was shifting
constantly from side to side, staring at the Sorting Hat, and
fidgeting so energetically that Harry thought her feet might be
leaving the floor.</p>
<p>"Yes, he is," said one of the prefects who'd accompanied them, a
young woman wearing the blue of Ravenclaw. Miss Clearwater, if
Harry recalled correctly. Her voice was quiet, but conveyed a tinge
of pride. "That is the Charms Professor of Hogwarts, Filius
Flitwick, the most knowledgeable Charms Master alive, and a past
Duelling Champion -"</p>
<p>"Why's he so <em>short?</em> " hissed a student whose name Harry
didn't recall. "Is he a <em>halfbreed?</em> "</p>
<p>A chill glance from the young lady prefect. "The Professor does
indeed have goblin ancestry -"</p>
<p>"What?" Harry said involuntarily, causing Hermione and four
other students to hush him.</p>
<p>Now Harry was getting a surprisingly intimidating glare from the
Ravenclaw prefect.</p>
<p>"I mean -" Harry whispered. "Not that I have a <em>problem</em>
with that - it's just - I mean - how's that <em>possible?</em> You
can't just mix two different species together and get viable
offspring! It ought to scramble the genetic instructions for every
organ that's different between the two species - it'd be like
trying to build," they didn't have cars so he couldn't use a
scrambled-engine-blueprints analogy, "a half-carriage half-boat or
something..."</p>
<p>The Ravenclaw prefect was still looking at Harry severely. "Why
<em>couldn't</em> you have a half-carriage half-boat?"</p>
<p>"<em>Hssh!</em> " hsshed another prefect, though the Ravenclaw
witch had still spoken quietly.</p>
<p>"I mean -" Harry said even more quietly, trying to figure out
how to ask whether goblins had evolved from humans, or evolved from
a common ancestor of humans like <em>Homo erectus</em>, or if
goblins had been <em>made</em> out of humans somehow - if, say,
they were still genetically human under a heritable enchantment
whose magical effect was diluted if only one parent was a 'goblin',
which would explain how interbreeding was possible, and in which
case goblins would <em>not</em> be an incredibly valuable second
data point for how intelligence had evolved in other species
besides <em>Homo sapiens</em> - now that Harry thought about it,
the goblins in Gringotts <em>hadn't</em> seemed very much like
genuinely alien, nonhuman intelligences, nothing like Dirdir or
Puppeteers - "I mean, where did goblins <em>come</em> from,
anyway?"</p>
<p>"Lithuania," Hermione whispered absently, her eyes still fixed
firmly on the Sorting Hat.</p>
<p>Now Hermione was getting a smile from the lady prefect.</p>
<p>"Never mind," whispered Harry.</p>
<p>At the lectern, Professor McGonagall called out, "Goldstein,
Anthony!"</p>
<p>"RAVENCLAW!"</p>
<p>Hermione, next to Harry, was bouncing on her tiptoes so hard
that her feet were actually leaving the ground on each bounce.</p>
<p>"Goyle, Gregory!"</p>
<p>There was a long, tense moment of silence under the Hat. Almost
a minute.</p>
<p>"SLYTHERIN!"</p>
<p>"Granger, Hermione!"</p>
<p>Hermione broke loose and ran full tilt towards the Sorting Hat,
picked it up and jammed the patchy old clothwork down hard over her
head, making Harry wince. Hermione had been the one to explain to
<em>him</em> about the Sorting Hat, but she certainly didn't
<em>treat</em> it like an irreplaceable, vitally important,
800-year-old artefact of forgotten magic that was about to perform
intricate telepathy on her mind and didn't seem to be in very good
physical condition.</p>
<p>"RAVENCLAW!"</p>
<p>And talk about your foregone conclusions. Harry didn't see why
Hermione had been so tense about it. In what weird alternative
universe would that girl <em>not</em> be Sorted into Ravenclaw? If
Hermione Granger didn't go to Ravenclaw then there was no good
reason for Ravenclaw House to exist.</p>
<p>Hermione arrived at the Ravenclaw table and got a dutiful cheer;
Harry wondered whether the cheer would have been louder, or
quieter, if they'd had any idea just what level of competition
they'd welcomed to their table. Harry knew pi to 3.141592 because
accuracy to one part in a million was enough for most practical
purposes. Hermione knew one hundred digits of pi because that was
how many digits had been printed in the back of her maths
textbook.</p>
<p>Neville Longbottom went to Hufflepuff, Harry was glad to see. If
that House really did contain the loyalty and camaraderie it was
supposed to exemplify, then a Houseful of reliable friends would do
Neville a whole world of good. Clever kids in Ravenclaw, evil kids
in Slytherin, wannabe heroes in Gryffindor, and everyone who does
the actual work in Hufflepuff.</p>
<p>(Though Harry <em>had</em> been right to consult a Ravenclaw
prefect first. The young woman hadn't even looked up from her
reading or identified Harry, just jabbed a wand in Neville's
direction and muttered something. After which Neville had acquired
a dazed expression and wandered off to the fifth carriage from the
front and the fourth compartment on the left, which indeed had
contained his toad.)</p>
<p>"Malfoy, Draco!" went to Slytherin, and Harry breathed a small
sigh of relief. It had <em>seemed</em> like a sure thing, but you
never did know what tiny event might upset the course of your
master plan.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall called "Perks, Sally-Anne!", and from the
gathered children detached a pale waifish girl who looked oddly
ethereal - like she might mysteriously disappear the moment you
stopped looking at her, and never be seen again or even
remembered.</p>
<p>And then (with a note of trepidation so firmly kept from her
voice and face that you'd have needed to know her very well indeed
to notice) Minerva McGonagall inhaled deeply, and called out,
"Potter, Harry!"</p>
<p>There was a sudden silence in the hall.</p>
<p>All conversation stopped.</p>
<p>All eyes turned to stare.</p>
<p>For the first time in his entire life, Harry felt like he might
be having an opportunity to experience stage fright.</p>
<p>Harry immediately stomped down this feeling. Whole room-fulls of
people staring at him was something he'd have to accustom himself
to, if he wanted to live in magical Britain, or for that matter do
anything else interesting with his life. Affixing a confident and
false smile to his face, he raised a foot to step forwards -</p>
<p>"Harry Potter!" cried the voice of either Fred or George
Weasley, and then "Harry Potter!" cried the other Weasley twin, and
a moment later the entire Gryffindor table, and soon after a good
portion of Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff, had taken up the cry.</p>
<p><em>"Harry Potter! Harry Potter! Harry Potter!</em> "</p>
<p>And Harry Potter walked forwards. Much too slowly, he realized
once he'd begun, but by then it was too late to alter his pace
without it looking awkward.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"<em>Harry Potter! Harry Potter! HARRY POTTER!"</em></p>
<p>With all too good a notion of what she would see, Minerva
McGonagall turned to look behind herself at the rest of the Head
Table.</p>
<p>Trelawney frantically fanning herself, Filius looking on with
curiosity, Hagrid clapping along, Sprout looking severe, Vector and
Sinistra bemused, and Quirrell gazing vacuously at nothing. Albus
smiling benevolently. And Severus Snape gripping his empty wine
goblet, white-knuckled, so hard that the silver was slowly
deforming.</p>
<p>With a wide grin, turning his head to bow to one side and then
the other as he walked between the four House tables, Harry Potter
walked forwards at a grandly measured pace, a prince inheriting his
castle.</p>
<p><em>"Save us from some more Dark Lords!"</em> called one of the
Weasley twins, and then the other Weasley twin cried,
<em>"Especially if they're Professors!"</em> to general laughter
from all the tables except Slytherin.</p>
<p>Minerva's lips set in a white line. She would have words with
the Weasley Horrors about that last part, if they thought she was
powerless because it was the first day of school and Gryffindor had
no points to take away. If they didn't care about detentions then
she would find something else.</p>
<p>Then, with a sudden gasp of horror, she looked in Severus's
direction, <em>surely</em> he realized the Potter boy must have no
idea who that was talking about -</p>
<p>Severus's face had gone beyond rage into a kind of pleasant
indifference. A faint smile played about his lips. He was looking
in the direction of Harry Potter, not the Gryffindor table, and his
hands held the crumpled remains of a former wine goblet.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry Potter walked forwards with a fixed smile, feeling warm
inside and sort of awful at the same time.</p>
<p>They were cheering him for a job he'd done when he was one year
old. A job he hadn't really finished. Somewhere, somehow, the Dark
Lord was still alive. Would they have been cheering quite so hard,
if they knew that?</p>
<p>But the Dark Lord's power <em>had</em> been broken once.</p>
<p>And Harry would protect them again. If there was in fact a
prophecy and that was what it said. Well, actually regardless of
what any darn prophecy said.</p>
<p>All those people believing in him and cheering him - Harry
couldn't stand to let that be false. To flash and fade like so many
other child prodigies. To be a disappointment. To fail to live up
to his reputation as a symbol of the Light, never mind <em>how</em>
he'd gotten it. He would absolutely, positively, no matter how long
it took and even if it killed him, fulfill their expectations. And
then go on to <em>exceed</em> those expectations, so that people
wondered, looking back, that they had once asked so little of
him.</p>
<p><em>"HARRY POTTER! HARRY POTTER! HARRY POTTER!"</em></p>
<p>Harry took his last steps towards the Sorting Hat. He swept a
bow to the Order of Chaos at the Gryffindor table, and then turned
and swept another bow to the other side of the hall, and waited for
the applause and giggling to die away.</p>
<p>(In the back of his mind, he wondered if the Sorting Hat was
genuinely <em>conscious</em> in the sense of being aware of its own
awareness, and if so, whether it was satisfied with only getting to
talk to eleven-year-olds once per year. Its song had implied so:
<em>Oh, I'm the Sorting Hat and I'm okay, I sleep all year and I
work one day...</em>)</p>
<p>When there was once more silence in the room, Harry sat on the
stool and <em>carefully</em> placed onto his head the 800-year-old
telepathic artefact of forgotten magic.</p>
<p>Thinking, just as hard as he could: <em>Don't Sort me yet! I
have questions I need to ask you! Have I ever been Obliviated? Did
you Sort the Dark Lord when he was a child and can you tell me
about his weaknesses? Can you tell me why I got the brother wand to
the Dark Lord's? Is the Dark Lord's ghost bound to my scar and is
that why I get so angry sometimes? Those are the most important
questions, but if you've got another moment can you tell me
anything about how to rediscover the lost magics that created
you?</em></p>
<p>Into the silence of Harry's spirit, where before there had never
been any voice but one, there came a second and unfamiliar voice,
sounding distinctly worried:</p>
<p><em>"Oh, dear. This has never happened before..."</em></p>

<p><em>Some</em> children would have waited until <em>after</em>
their first trip to Diagon Alley.</p>
<p>"Bag of element 79," Harry said, and withdrew his hand, empty,
from the mokeskin pouch.</p>
<p>Most children would have at least waited to get their
<em>wands</em> first.</p>
<p>"Bag of <em>okane,</em>" said Harry. The heavy bag of gold
popped up into his hand.</p>
<p>Harry withdrew the bag, then plunged it again into the mokeskin
pouch. He took out his hand, put it back in, and said, "Bag of
tokens of economic exchange." That time his hand came out
empty.</p>
<p>"Give me back the bag that I just put in." Out came the bag of
gold once more.</p>
<p>Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres had gotten his hands on at least
one magical item. Why wait?</p>
<p>"Professor McGonagall," Harry said to the bemused witch
strolling beside him, "can you give me two words, one word for
gold, and one word for something else that isn't money, in a
language that I wouldn't know? But don't tell me which is
which."</p>
<p>"<em>Ahava</em> and <em>zahav,</em>" said Professor McGonagall.
"That's Hebrew, and the other word means love."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Professor. Bag of <em>ahava.</em>" Empty.</p>
<p>"Bag of <em>zahav.</em>" And it popped up into his hand.</p>
<p>"Zahav is gold?" Harry questioned, and Professor McGonagall
nodded.</p>
<p>Harry thought over his collected experimental data. It was only
the most crude and preliminary sort of effort, but it was enough to
support at least one conclusion:</p>
<p>"<em>Aaaaaaarrrgh this doesn't make any sense!</em> "</p>
<p>The witch beside him lifted a lofty eyebrow. "Problems, Mr.
Potter?"</p>
<p>"I just falsified every single hypothesis I had! How can it know
that 'bag of 115 Galleons' is okay but not 'bag of 90 plus 25
Galleons'? It can <em>count</em> but it can't <em>add?</em> It can
understand nouns, but not some noun phrases that mean the same
thing? The person who made this probably didn't speak Japanese and
<em>I</em> don't speak any Hebrew, so it's not using <em>their</em>
knowledge, and it's not using <em>my</em> knowledge -" Harry waved
a hand helplessly. "The rules seem <em>sorta</em> consistent but
they don't <em>mean</em> anything! I'm not even going to ask how a
<em>pouch</em> ends up with voice recognition and natural language
understanding when the best Artificial Intelligence programmers
can't get the fastest supercomputers to do it after thirty-five
years of hard work," Harry gasped for breath, "but <em>what</em> is
going <em>on?</em> "</p>
<p>"Magic," said Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>"That's just a <em>word!</em> Even after you tell me that, I
can't make any new predictions! It's exactly like saying
'phlogiston' or 'elan vital' or 'emergence' or 'complexity'!"</p>
<p>The black-robed witch laughed aloud. "But it <em>is</em> magic,
Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>Harry slumped over a little. "With respect, Professor
McGonagall, I'm not quite sure you understand what I'm trying to do
here."</p>
<p>"With respect, Mr. Potter, I'm quite sure I don't. Unless - this
is just a guess, mind - you're trying to take over the world?"</p>
<p>"No! I mean yes - well, <em>no!</em> "</p>
<p>"I think I should perhaps be alarmed that you have trouble
answering the question."</p>
<p>Harry glumly considered the Dartmouth Conference on Artificial
Intelligence in 1956. It had been the first conference ever on the
topic, the one that had coined the phrase "Artificial
Intelligence". They had identified key problems such as making
computers understand language, learn, and improve themselves. They
had suggested, in perfect seriousness, that significant advances on
these problems might be made by ten scientists working together for
two months.</p>
<p><em>No. Chin up. You're just</em> starting <em>on the problem of
unravelling all the secrets of magic. You don't actually</em> know
<em>whether it's going to be too difficult to do in two
months.</em></p>
<p>"And you <em>really</em> haven't heard of other wizards asking
these sorts of questions or doing this sort of scientific
experimenting?" Harry asked again. It just seemed so
<em>obvious</em> to him.</p>
<p>Then again, it'd taken more than two hundred years
<em>after</em> the invention of the scientific method before any
Muggle scientists had thought to systematically investigate which
sentences a <em>human four-year-old</em> could or couldn't
understand. The developmental psychology of linguistics could've
been discovered in the eighteenth century, in principle, but no one
had even thought to look until the twentieth. So you couldn't
really blame the much smaller wizarding world for not investigating
the Retrieval Charm.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall pursed her lips, then shrugged. "I'm still
not sure what you mean by 'scientific experimenting', Mr. Potter.
As I said, I've seen Muggleborn students try to get Muggle science
to work inside Hogwarts, and people invent new Charms and Potions
every year."</p>
<p>Harry shook his head. "Technology isn't the same thing as
science at all. And trying lots of different ways to do something
isn't the same as experimenting to figure out the rules." There
were plenty of people who'd tried to invent flying machines by
trying out lots of things-with-wings, but only the Wright Brothers
had built a wind tunnel to measure lift... "Um, how many
Muggle-raised children <em>do</em> you get at Hogwarts every
year?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps ten or so?"</p>
<p>Harry missed a step and almost tripped over his own feet.
"<em>Ten?</em> "</p>
<p>The Muggle world had a population of six billion and counting.
If you were one in a million, there were seven of you in London and
a thousand more in China. It was inevitable that the Muggle
population would produce <em>some</em> eleven-year-olds who could
do calculus - Harry knew he wasn't the only one. He'd met other
prodigies in mathematical competitions. In fact he'd been
thoroughly trounced by competitors who probably spent literally
<em>all day</em> practising maths problems and who'd <em>never</em>
read a science-fiction book and who would burn out
<em>completely</em> before <em>puberty</em> and <em>never</em>
amount to <em>anything</em> in their future lives because they'd
just practised <em>known</em> techniques instead of learning to
think <em>creatively</em>. (Harry was something of a sore
loser.)</p>
<p>But... in the wizarding world...</p>
<p>Ten Muggle-raised children per year, who'd all ended their
Muggle educations at the age of eleven? And Professor McGonagall
might be biased, but she had claimed that Hogwarts was the largest
and most eminent wizarding school in the world... and it only
educated up to the age of seventeen.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall undoubtedly knew every last detail of how
you went about turning into a cat. But she seemed to have literally
never <em>heard</em> of the scientific method. To her it was just
Muggle magic. And she didn't even seem <em>curious</em> about what
secrets might be hiding behind the natural language understanding
of the Retrieval Charm.</p>
<p>That left two possibilities, really.</p>
<p>Possibility one: Magic was so incredibly opaque, convoluted, and
impenetrable, that even though wizards and witches had tried their
best to understand, they'd made little or no progress and
eventually given up; and Harry would do no better.</p>
<p><em>Or</em>...</p>
<p>Harry cracked his knuckles in determination, but they only made
a quiet sort of clicking sound, rather than echoing ominously off
the walls of Diagon Alley.</p>
<p>Possibility two: He'd be taking over the world.</p>
<p>Eventually. Perhaps not right away.</p>
<p>That sort of thing <em>did</em> sometimes take longer than two
months. Muggle science hadn't gone to the moon in the first week
after Galileo.</p>
<p>But Harry still couldn't stop the huge smile that was stretching
his cheeks so wide they were starting to hurt.</p>
<p>Harry had always been frightened of ending up as one of those
child prodigies that never amounted to anything and spent the rest
of their lives boasting about how far ahead they'd been at age ten.
But then most adult geniuses never amounted to anything either.
There were probably a thousand people as intelligent as Einstein
for every actual Einstein in history. Because those other geniuses
hadn't gotten their hands on the one thing you absolutely needed to
achieve greatness. They'd never found an important problem.</p>
<p><em>You're mine now,</em> Harry thought at the walls of Diagon
Alley, and all the shops and items, and all the shopkeepers and
customers; and all the lands and people of wizarding Britain, and
all the wider wizarding world; and the entire greater universe of
which Muggle scientists understood so much less than they believed.
<em>I, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, do now claim this territory
in the name of Science.</em></p>
<p>Lightning and thunder completely failed to flash and boom in the
cloudless skies.</p>
<p>"What are you smiling about?" inquired Professor McGonagall,
warily and wearily.</p>
<p>"I'm wondering if there's a spell to make lightning flash in the
background whenever I make an ominous resolution," explained Harry.
He was carefully memorising the exact words of his ominous
resolution so that future history books would get it right.</p>
<p>"I have the distinct feeling that I ought to be doing something
about this," sighed Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>"Ignore it, it'll go away. Ooh, shiny!" Harry put his thoughts
of world conquest temporarily on hold and skipped over to a shop
with an open display, and Professor McGonagall followed.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry had now bought his potions ingredients and cauldron, and,
oh, a few more things. Items that seemed like good things to carry
in Harry's Bag of Holding (aka Moke Super Pouch QX31 with
Undetectable Extension Charm, Retrieval Charm, and Widening Lip).
Smart, sensible purchases.</p>
<p>Harry genuinely didn't understand why Professor McGonagall was
looking so <em>suspicious</em>.</p>
<p>Right now, Harry was in a shop expensive enough to display in
the twisting main street of Diagon Alley. The shop had an open
front with merchandise laid out on slanted wooden rows, guarded
only by slight grey glows and a young-looking salesgirl in a
much-shortened version of witch's robes that exposed her knees and
elbows.</p>
<p>Harry was examining the wizarding equivalent of a first-aid kit,
the Emergency Healing Pack Plus. There were two self-tightening
tourniquets. A syringe of what looked like liquid fire, which was
supposed to drastically slow circulation in a treated area while
maintaining oxygenation of the blood for up to three minutes, if
you needed to prevent a poison from spreading through the body.
White cloth that could be wrapped over a part of the body to
temporarily numb pain. Plus any number of other items that Harry
totally failed to comprehend, like the "Dementor Exposure
Treatment", which looked and smelled like ordinary chocolate. Or
the "Bafflesnaffle Counter", which looked like a small quivering
egg and carried a placard showing how to jam it up someone's
nostril.</p>
<p>"A definite buy at five Galleons, wouldn't you agree?" Harry
said to Professor McGonagall, and the teenage salesgirl hovering
nearby nodded eagerly.</p>
<p>Harry had expected the Professor to make some sort of approving
remark about his prudence and preparedness.</p>
<p>What he was getting instead could only be described as the Evil
Eye.</p>
<p>"And just <em>why</em>," Professor McGonagall said with heavy
scepticism, "do you expect to <em>need</em> a healer's kit, young
man?" (After the unfortunate incident at the Potions shop,
Professor McGonagall was trying to avoid saying "Mr. Potter" while
anyone else was nearby.)</p>
<p>Harry's mouth opened and closed. "I don't <em>expect</em> to
need it! It's just in case!"</p>
<p>"Just in case of <em>what?</em> "</p>
<p>Harry's eyes widened. "You think I'm <em>planning</em> to do
something dangerous and <em>that's</em> why I want a medical
kit?"</p>
<p>A look of grim suspicion and ironic disbelief was the
answer.</p>
<p>"Great Scott!" said Harry. (This was an expression he'd learned
from the mad scientist Doc Brown in <em>Back to the Future</em>.)
"Were you also thinking that when I bought the Feather-Falling
Potion, the Gillyweed, and the bottle of Food and Water Pills?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>Harry shook his head in amazement. "Just what sort of plan do
you think I have <em>going</em>, here?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," Professor McGonagall said darkly, "but it ends
either in you delivering a ton of silver to Gringotts, or in world
domination."</p>
<p>"World domination is such an ugly phrase. I prefer to call it
world optimisation."</p>
<p>This hilarious joke failed to reassure the witch giving him the
Look of Doom.</p>
<p>"Wow," Harry said, as he realised that she was serious. "You
really think that. You really think I'm planning to do something
dangerous."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Like that's the <em>only</em> reason anyone would ever buy a
first-aid kit? Don't take this the wrong way, Professor McGonagall,
but <em>what sort of crazy children are you used to dealing
with</em>?"</p>
<p>"Gryffindors," spat Professor McGonagall, the word carrying a
freight of bitterness and despair that fell like an eternal curse
on all youthful enthusiasm and high spirits.</p>
<p>"Deputy Headmistress Professor Minerva McGonagall," Harry said,
putting his hands sternly on his hips. "I am not going to be in
Gryffindor -"</p>
<p>At this point the Deputy Headmistress interjected something
about how if he <em>was</em> she would figure out how to kill a
hat, which odd remark Harry let pass without comment, though the
salesgirl seemed to be having a sudden coughing fit.</p>
<p>"- I am going to be in Ravenclaw. And if you really think that
I'm planning to do something dangerous, then, honestly, you don't
understand me <em>at all.</em> I don't <em>like</em> danger, it is
<em>scary.</em> I am being <em>prudent</em>. I am being
<em>cautious</em>. I am preparing for <em>unforeseen
contingencies</em>. Like my parents used to sing to me: <em>Be
prepared! That's the Boy Scout's marching song! Be prepared! As
through life you march along! Don't be nervous, don't be flustered,
don't be scared - be prepared!</em> "</p>
<p>(Harry's parents had in fact only ever sung him those
<em>particular</em> lines of that Tom Lehrer song, and Harry was
blissfully unaware of the rest.)</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall's stance had slightly softened - though
mostly when Harry had said that he was heading for Ravenclaw. "What
sort of <em>contingency</em> do you imagine this kit might prepare
you for, <em>young man?</em> "</p>
<p>"One of my classmates gets bitten by a horrible monster, and as
I scrabble frantically in my mokeskin pouch for something that
could help her, she looks at me sadly and with her last breath
says, <em>'Why weren't you prepared?'</em> And then she dies, and I
know as her eyes close that she won't ever forgive me -"</p>
<p>Harry heard the salesgirl gasp, and he looked up to see her
staring at him with her lips pressed tight. Then the young woman
whirled and fled into the deeper recesses of the shop.</p>
<p><em>What...?</em></p>
<p>Professor McGonagall reached down, and took Harry's hand in
hers, gently but firmly, and pulled Harry out of the main street of
Diagon Alley, leading him into an alleyway between two shops which
was paved in dirty bricks and dead-ended in a wall of solid black
dirt.</p>
<p>The tall witch pointed her wand at the main street and spoke,
<em>"Quietus</em>" she said, and a screen of silence descended
around them, blocking out all the street noises.</p>
<p><em>What did I do wrong...</em></p>
<p>Professor McGonagall turned to regard Harry. She didn't have a
full adult Wrongdoing Face, but her expression was flat,
controlled. "You must remember, Mr. Potter," she said, "that there
was a war in this country not ten years ago. Everyone has lost
someone, and to speak of friends dying in your arms - is not done
lightly."</p>
<p>"I - I didn't mean to -" The inference dropped like a falling
stone into Harry's exceptionally vivid imagination. He'd talked
about someone breathing their last breath - and then the salesgirl
had run away - and the war had ended ten years ago so that girl
would have been at most eight or nine years old, when, when, "I'm
sorry, I didn't mean to..." Harry choked up, and turned away to run
from the older witch's gaze but there was a wall of dirt blocking
his way and he didn't have his wand yet. "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm
<em>sorry!</em> "</p>
<p>There came a heavy sigh from behind him. "I know you are, Mr.
Potter."</p>
<p>Harry dared to peek behind him. Professor McGonagall only seemed
sad, now. "I'm sorry," Harry said again, feeling wretched. "Did
anything like that happen to -" and then Harry shut his lips and
slapped a hand over his mouth for good measure.</p>
<p>The older witch's face grew a little sadder. "You must learn to
think before you speak, Mr. Potter, or else go through life without
many friends. That has been the fate of many a Ravenclaw, and I
hope it will not be yours."</p>
<p>Harry wanted to just run away. He wanted to pull out a wand and
erase the whole thing from Professor McGonagall's memory, be back
with her outside the shop again, <em>make it didn't happen
-</em></p>
<p>"But to answer your question, Mr. Potter, no, nothing like
<em>that</em> has ever happened to me. Certainly I've watched a
friend breathe their last, once or seven times. But not one of them
ever cursed me as they died, and I never thought that they wouldn't
forgive me. Why would you <em>say</em> such a thing, Mr. Potter?
Why would you even <em>think</em> it?"</p>
<p>"I, I, I," Harry swallowed. "It's just that I always try to
imagine the worst thing that could happen," and maybe he'd also
been joking around a little but he would rather have bitten off his
own tongue than say that now.</p>
<p>"What?" said Professor McGonagall. "But <em>why?"</em></p>
<p>"So I can stop it from happening!"</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter..." the older witch's voice trailed off. Then she
sighed, and knelt down beside him. "Mr. Potter," she said, gently
now, "it's not your responsibility to take care of the students at
Hogwarts. It's mine. I won't let anything bad happen to you or
anyone else. Hogwarts is the safest place for magical children in
all the wizarding world, and Madam Pomfrey has a full healer's
office. You won't need a healer's kit at all, let alone a
five-Galleon one."</p>
<p>"But I <em>do!</em> " Harry burst out. "<em>Nowhere</em> is
perfectly safe! And what if my parents have a heart attack or get
in an accident when I go home for Christmas - Madam Pomfrey won't
be there, I'll need a healer's kit of my own -"</p>
<p>"<em>What</em> in Merlin's name..." Professor McGonagall said.
She stood up, and looked down at Harry an expression torn between
annoyance and concern. "There's no need to think about such
terrible things, Mr. Potter!"</p>
<p>Harry's expression twisted up into bitterness, hearing that.
"Yes there <em>is!</em> If you don't think, you don't just get hurt
yourself, you end up hurting other people!"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, then closed it. The witch
rubbed the bridge of her nose, looking thoughtful. "Mr. Potter...
if I were to offer to listen to you for a while... is there
anything you'd like to talk to me about?"</p>
<p>"About what?"</p>
<p>"About why you're convinced you must always be on your guard
against terrible things happening to you."</p>
<p>Harry stared at her in puzzlement. That was a self-evident
axiom. "Well..." Harry said slowly. He tried to organise his
thoughts. How <em>could</em> he explain himself to a
Professor-witch, when she didn't even know the basics? "Muggle
researchers have found that people are always very optimistic,
compared to reality. Like they say something will take two days and
it takes ten days, or they say it'll take two months and it takes
over thirty-five years. For example, in one experiment, they asked
students for times by which they were 50% sure, 75% sure, and 99%
sure they'd complete their homework, and only 13%, 19%, and 45% of
the students finished by those times. And they found that the
reason was that when they asked one group for their best-case
estimates if everything went as well as possible, and another group
for their average-case estimates if everything went as usual, they
got back answers that were statistically indistinguishable. See, if
you ask someone what they expect in the <em>normal</em> case, they
visualise what looks like the line of maximum probability at each
step along the way - everything going according to plan, with no
surprises. But actually, since more than half the students didn't
finish by the time they were 99% sure they'd be done, reality
usually delivers results a little worse than the 'worst-case
scenario'. It's called the planning fallacy, and the best way to
fix it is to ask how long things took the last time you tried them.
That's called using the outside view instead of the inside view.
But when you're doing something new and can't do that, you just
have to be really, really, really pessimistic. Like, so pessimistic
that reality actually comes out <em>better</em> than you expected
around as often and as much as it comes out worse. It's actually
<em>really hard</em> to be <em>so</em> pessimistic that you stand a
decent chance of <em>undershooting</em> real life. Like I make this
big effort to be gloomy and I imagine one of my classmates getting
bitten, but what actually happens is that the surviving Death
Eaters attack the whole school to get at me. But on a happier note
-"</p>
<p>"Stop," said Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>Harry stopped. He had just been about to point out that at least
they knew the Dark Lord wouldn't attack, since he was dead.</p>
<p>"I think I might not have made myself clear," the witch said,
her precise Scottish voice sounding even more careful. "Did
anything happen to <em>you personally</em> that frightened you, Mr.
Potter?"</p>
<p>"What happened to me personally is only anecdotal evidence,"
Harry explained. "It doesn't carry the same weight as a replicated,
peer-reviewed journal article about a controlled study with random
assignment, many subjects, large effect sizes and strong
statistical significance."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall pinched the bridge of her nose, inhaled,
and exhaled. "I would still like to hear about it," she said.</p>
<p>"Um..." Harry said. He took a deep breath. "There'd been some
muggings in our neighborhood, and my mother asked me to return a
pan she'd borrowed to a neighbor two streets away, and I said I
didn't want to because I might get mugged, and she said, 'Harry,
don't say things like that!' Like thinking about it would
<em>make</em> it happen, so if I didn't talk about it, I would be
safe. I tried to explain why I wasn't reassured, and she made me
carry over the pan anyway. I was too young to know how
statistically unlikely it was for a mugger to target me, but I was
old enough to know that not-thinking about something doesn't stop
it from happening, so I was really scared."</p>
<p>"Nothing else?" Professor McGonagall said after a pause, when it
became clear that Harry was done. "There isn't anything
<em>else</em> that happened to you?"</p>
<p>"I know it doesn't <em>sound</em> like much," Harry defended.
"But it was just one of those critical life moments, you see? I
mean, I <em>knew</em> that not thinking about something doesn't
stop it from happening, I <em>knew</em> that, but I could see that
Mum really thought that way." Harry stopped, struggling with the
anger that was starting to rise up again when he thought about it.
"She <em>wouldn't listen</em>. I tried to tell her, I
<em>begged</em> her not to send me out, and she <em>laughed it
off</em>. Everything I said, she treated like some sort of big
joke..." Harry forced the black rage back down again. "That's when
I realised that everyone who was supposed to protect me was
actually crazy, and that they wouldn't listen to me no matter how
much I begged them, and that I couldn't ever rely on them to get
anything right." Sometimes good intentions weren't enough,
sometimes you had to be sane...</p>
<p>There was a long silence.</p>
<p>Harry took the time to breathe deeply and calm himself down.
There was no point in getting angry. There was no point in getting
angry. <em>All</em> parents were like that, <em>no</em> adult would
lower themselves far enough to place themselves on level ground
with a child and listen, his genetic parents would have been no
different. Sanity was a tiny spark in the night, an infinitesimally
rare exception to the rule of madness, so there was no point in
getting angry.</p>
<p>Harry didn't like himself when he was angry.</p>
<p>"Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Potter," said Professor
McGonagall after a while. There was an abstracted look on her face
(almost exactly the same look that had appeared on Harry's own face
while experimenting on the pouch, if Harry had only seen himself in
a mirror to realise that). "I shall have to think about this." She
turned towards the alley mouthway, and raised her wand -</p>
<p>"Um," Harry said, "can we go get the healer's kit now?"</p>
<p>The witch paused, and looked back at him steadily. "And if I say
no - that it is too expensive and you won't need it - then
what?"</p>
<p>Harry's face twisted in bitterness. "Exactly what you're
thinking, Professor McGonagall. <em>Exactly</em> what you're
thinking. I conclude you're another crazy adult I can't talk to,
and I start planning how to get my hands on a healer's kit
anyway."</p>
<p>"I am your guardian on this trip," Professor McGonagall said
with a tinge of danger. "I <em>will not</em> allow you to push me
around."</p>
<p>"I understand," Harry said. He kept the resentment out of his
voice, and didn't say any of the other things that came to mind.
Professor McGonagall had told him to think before he spoke. He
probably wouldn't remember that tomorrow, but he could at least
remember it for five minutes.</p>
<p>The witch's wand made a slight circle in her hand, and the
noises of Diagon Alley came back. "All right, young man," she said.
"Let's go get that healer's kit."</p>
<p>Harry's jaw dropped in surprise. Then he hurried after her,
almost stumbling in his sudden rush.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The shop was the same as they had left it, recognisable and
unrecognisable items still laid out on the slanted wooden display,
the grey glow still protecting and the salesgirl back in her old
position. The salesgirl looked up as they approached, her face
showing surprise.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," she said as they got closer, and Harry spoke at
almost the same moment, "I apologise for -"</p>
<p>They broke off and looked at each other, and then the salesgirl
laughed a little. "I didn't mean to get you in trouble with
Professor McGonagall," she said. Her voice lowered
conspiratorially. "I hope she wasn't <em>too</em> awful to
you."</p>
<p>"<em>Della!</em> " said Professor McGonagall, sounding
scandalised.</p>
<p>"Bag of gold," Harry said to his pouch, and then looked back up
at the salesgirl while he counted out five Galleons. "Don't worry,
I understand that she's only awful to me because she loves me."</p>
<p>He counted out five Galleons to the salesgirl while Professor
McGonagall was spluttering something unimportant. "One Emergency
Healing Pack Plus, please."</p>
<p>It was actually sort of unnerving to see how the Widening Lip
swallowed the briefcase-sized medical kit. Harry couldn't help
wondering what would happen if he tried climbing into the mokeskin
pouch himself, given that only the person who put something in was
supposed to be able to take it out again.</p>
<p>When the pouch was done... eating... his hard-won purchase,
Harry swore he heard a small burping sound afterward. That
<em>had</em> to have been spelled in on purpose. The alternative
hypothesis was too horrifying to contemplate... in fact Harry
couldn't even <em>think</em> of any alternative hypotheses. Harry
looked back up at the Professor, as they began walking through
Diagon Alley once more. "Where to next?"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall pointed toward a shop that looked as if it
had been made from flesh instead of bricks and covered in fur
instead of paint. "Small pets are permitted at Hogwarts - you could
get an owl to send letters, for example -"</p>
<p>"Can I pay a Knut or something and <em>rent</em> an owl when I
need to send mail?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>"Then I think emphatically <em>no.</em>"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall nodded, as though ticking off a point.
"Might I ask why not?"</p>
<p>"I had a pet rock once. It died."</p>
<p>"You don't think you could take care of a pet?"</p>
<p>"I <em>could,</em>" Harry said, "but I would end up obsessing
all day long about whether I'd remembered to feed it that day or if
it was slowly starving in its cage, wondering where its master was
and why there wasn't any food."</p>
<p>"That poor owl," the older witch said in a soft voice.
"Abandoned like that. I wonder what it would do."</p>
<p>"Well, I expect it'd get really hungry and start trying to claw
its way out of the cage or the box or whatever, though it probably
wouldn't have much luck with that -" Harry stopped short.</p>
<p>The witch went on, still in that soft voice. "And what would
happen to it afterward?"</p>
<p>"Excuse me," Harry said, and he reached up to take Professor
McGonagall by the hand, gently but firmly, and steered her into yet
another alleyway; after ducking so many well-wishers the process
had become almost unnoticeably routine. "Please cast that silencing
spell."</p>
<p>"<em>Quietus.</em>"</p>
<p>Harry's voice was shaking. "That owl does <em>not</em> represent
me, my parents <em>never</em> locked me in a cupboard and left me
to starve, I do <em>not</em> have abandonment fears and I <em>don't
like the trend of your thoughts, Professor McGonagall!</em> "</p>
<p>The witch looked down at him gravely. "And what thoughts would
those be, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>"You think I was," Harry was having trouble saying it, "I was
<em>abused?</em> "</p>
<p>"Were you?"</p>
<p>"<em>No!</em> " Harry shouted. "No, I never was! Do you think
I'm <em>stupid?</em> I <em>know</em> about the concept of child
abuse, I <em>know</em> about inappropriate touching and all of that
and if anything like that happened I would call the police! And
report it to the head teacher! And look up social services in the
phone book! And tell Grandpa and Grandma and Mrs. Figg! But my
parents <em>never</em> did anything like that, never ever
<em>ever!</em> How <em>dare</em> you suggest such a thing!"</p>
<p>The older witch gazed at him steadily. "It is my duty as Deputy
Headmistress to investigate possible signs of abuse in the children
under my care."</p>
<p>Harry's anger was spiralling out of control into pure, black
fury. "Don't you ever <em>dare</em> breathe a word of these, these
<em>insinuations</em> to anyone else! <em>No one</em>, do you hear
me, McGonagall? An accusation like that can ruin people and destroy
families even when the parents are completely innocent! I've read
about it in the newspapers!" Harry's voice was climbing to a
high-pitched scream. "The <em>system</em> doesn't know how to
<em>stop</em>, it doesn't believe the parents <em>or</em> the
children when they say nothing happened! <em>Don't you dare
threaten my family with that! I won't let you destroy my
home!</em> "</p>
<p>"Harry," the older witch said softly, and she reached out a hand
towards him -</p>
<p>Harry took a fast step back, and his hand snapped up and knocked
hers away.</p>
<p>McGonagall froze, then she pulled her hand back, and took a step
backwards. "Harry, it's all right," she said. "I believe you."</p>
<p>"<em>Do you,</em>" Harry hissed. The fury still roaring through
his blood. "Or are you just waiting to get away from me so you can
file the papers?"</p>
<p>"Harry, I saw your house. I saw you with your parents. They love
you. You love them. I do believe you when you say that your parents
are not abusing you. But I <em>had</em> to ask, because there is
something strange at work here."</p>
<p>Harry stared at her coldly. "Like what?"</p>
<p>"Harry, I've seen many abused children in my time at Hogwarts,
it would break your heart to know how many. And, when you're happy,
you don't behave like one of those children, not at <em>all</em>.
You smile at strangers, you hug people, I put my hand on your
shoulder and you didn't flinch. But sometimes, only sometimes, you
say or do something that seems <em>very</em> much like... someone
who spent his first eleven years locked in a cellar. Not the loving
family that I saw." Professor McGonagall tilted her head, her
expression growing puzzled again.</p>
<p>Harry took this in, processing it. The black rage began to drain
away, as it dawned on him that he was being listened to
respectfully, and that his family wasn't in danger.</p>
<p>"And how <em>do</em> you explain your observations, Professor
McGonagall?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," she said. "But it's possible that something
could have happened to you that you don't remember."</p>
<p>Fury rose up again in Harry. That sounded all too much like what
he'd read in the newspaper stories of shattered families.
"Suppressed memory is a load of <em>pseudoscience!</em> People do
<em>not</em> repress traumatic memories, they remember them all
<em>too</em> well for the rest of their lives!"</p>
<p>"No, Mr. Potter. There is a Charm called Obliviation."</p>
<p>Harry froze in place. "A spell that erases memories?"</p>
<p>The older witch nodded. "But not all the effects of the
experience, if you see what I'm saying, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>A chill went down Harry's spine. <em>That</em> hypothesis...
could <em>not</em> be easily refuted. "But my parents couldn't do
that!"</p>
<p>"Indeed not," said Professor McGonagall. "It would have taken
someone from the wizarding world. There's... no way to be certain,
I'm afraid."</p>
<p>Harry's rationalist skills began to boot up again. "Professor
McGonagall, how sure are you of your observations, and what
alternative explanations could there also be?"</p>
<p>The witch opened her hands, as though to show their emptiness.
"Sure? I'm sure of <em>nothing</em>, Mr. Potter. In all my life
I've never met anyone else like you. Sometimes you just don't seem
eleven years old or even all that <em>human</em>."</p>
<p>Harry's eyebrows rose toward the sky -</p>
<p>"I'm sorry!" Professor McGonagall said quickly. "I'm very sorry,
Mr. Potter. I was trying to make a point and I'm afraid that came
out sounding different from what I had in mind -"</p>
<p>"On the contrary, Professor McGonagall," Harry said, and slowly
smiled. "I shall take it as a very great compliment. But would you
mind if I offered an alternative explanation?"</p>
<p>"Please do."</p>
<p>"Children aren't meant to be too much smarter than their
parents," Harry said. "Or too much saner, maybe - my father could
probably outsmart me if he was, you know, actually <em>trying,</em>
instead of using his adult intelligence mainly to come up with new
reasons not to change his mind -" Harry stopped. "I'm too smart,
Professor. I've got nothing to say to normal children. Adults don't
respect me enough to really talk to me. And frankly, even if they
did, they wouldn't sound as smart as Richard Feynman, so I might as
well read something Richard Feynman wrote instead. I'm
<em>isolated</em>, Professor McGonagall. I've been isolated my
whole life. Maybe that has some of the same effects as being locked
in a cellar. And I'm too intelligent to look up to my parents the
way that children are designed to do. My parents love me, but they
don't feel obliged to respond to reason, and sometimes I feel like
they're the children - children who <em>won't listen</em> and have
absolute authority over my whole existence. I try not to be too
bitter about it, but I also try to be <em>honest</em> with myself,
so, yes, I'm bitter. And I also have an anger management problem,
but I'm working on it. That's all."</p>
<p>"<em>That's all?</em> "</p>
<p>Harry nodded firmly. "That's all. Surely, Professor McGonagall,
even in magical Britain, the normal explanation is always worth
<em>considering?</em> "</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>It was later in the day, the sun lowering in the summer sky and
shoppers beginning to peter out from the streets. Some shops had
already closed; Harry and Professor McGonagall had bought his
textbooks from Flourish and Blotts just under the deadline. With
only a slight explosion when Harry had made a beeline for the
keyword "Arithmancy" and discovered that the seventh-year textbooks
invoked nothing more mathematically advanced than trigonometry.</p>
<p>At this moment, though, dreams of low-hanging research fruit
were far from Harry's mind.</p>
<p>At this moment, the two of them were walking out of
Ollivander's, and Harry was staring at his wand. He'd waved it, and
produced multicoloured sparks, which really shouldn't have come as
such an extra shock after everything else he'd seen, but somehow
-</p>
<p><em>I can do magic.</em></p>
<p><em>Me. As in, me personally. I am magical; I am a
wizard.</em></p>
<p>He had <em>felt</em> the magic pouring up his arm, and in that
instant, realised that he had always had that sense, that he had
possessed it his whole life, the sense that was not sight or sound
or smell or taste or touch but only magic. Like having eyes but
keeping them always closed, so that you didn't even realise that
you were seeing darkness; and then one day the eye opened, and saw
the world. The shock of it had poured through him, touching pieces
of himself, awakening them, and then died away in seconds; leaving
only the certain knowledge that he was now a wizard, and always had
been, and had even, in some strange way, always known it.</p>
<p>And -</p>
<p><em>"It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for
this wand when its brother why, its brother gave you that
scar."</em></p>
<p>That could not <em>possibly</em> be coincidence. There had been
<em>thousands</em> of wands in that shop. Well, okay, actually it
<em>could</em> be coincidence, there were six billion people in the
world and thousand-to-one coincidences happened every day. But
Bayes's Theorem said that any reasonable hypothesis which made it
<em>more</em> likely than a thousand-to-one that he'd end up with
the brother to the Dark Lord's wand, was going to have an
advantage.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall had simply said <em>how peculiar</em> and
left it at that, which had put Harry into a state of shock at the
sheer, overwhelming <em>uncuriosity</em> of wizards and witches. In
no <em>imaginable</em> world would Harry have just went "Hm" and
walked out of the shop without even <em>trying</em> to come up with
a hypothesis for what was going on.</p>
<p>His left hand rose and touched his scar.</p>
<p>What... <em>exactly...</em></p>
<p>"You're a full wizard now," said Professor McGonagall.
"Congratulations."</p>
<p>Harry nodded.</p>
<p>"And what do you think of the wizarding world?" said she.</p>
<p>"It's strange," Harry said. "I ought to be thinking about
everything I've seen of magic... everything that I now know is
possible, and everything I now know to be a lie, and all the work
left before me to understand it. And yet I find myself distracted
by relative trivialities like," Harry lowered his voice, "the whole
Boy-Who-Lived thing." There didn't seem to be anyone nearby, but no
point tempting fate.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall <em>ahemmed</em>. "Really? You don't
say."</p>
<p>Harry nodded. "Yes. It's just... <em>odd.</em> To find out that
you were part of this grand story, the quest to defeat the great
and terrible Dark Lord, and it's already <em>done.</em> Finished.
Completely over with. Like you're Frodo Baggins and you find out
that your parents took you to Mount Doom and had you toss in the
Ring when you were one year old and you don't even remember
it."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall's smile had grown somewhat fixed.</p>
<p>"You know, if I were anyone else, anyone else at all, I'd
probably be pretty worried about living up to that start. <em>Gosh,
Harry, what have you done since you defeated the Dark Lord? Your
own bookshop? That's great! Say, did you know I named my child
after you?</em> But I have hopes that this will not prove to be a
problem." Harry sighed. "Still... it's almost enough to make me
wish that there were <em>some</em> loose ends from the quest, just
so I could say that I really, you know, <em>participated</em>
somehow."</p>
<p>"Oh?" said Professor McGonagall in an odd tone. "What did you
have in mind?"</p>
<p>"Well, for example, you mentioned that my parents were betrayed.
Who betrayed them?"</p>
<p>"Sirius Black," the witch said, almost hissing the name. "He's
in Azkaban. Wizarding prison."</p>
<p>"How probable is it that Sirius Black will break out of prison
and I'll have to track him down and defeat him in some sort of
spectacular duel, or better yet put a large bounty on his head and
hide out in Australia while I wait for the results?"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall blinked. Twice. "Not likely. No one has
ever escaped from Azkaban, and I doubt that <em>he</em> will be the
first."</p>
<p>Harry was a bit sceptical of that "<em>no one</em> has
<em>ever</em> escaped from Azkaban" line. Still, maybe with magic
you could actually get close to a 100% perfect prison, especially
if you had a wand and they did not. The best way to get out would
be to not go there in the first place.</p>
<p>"All right then," Harry said. "Sounds like it's been nicely
wrapped up." He sighed, scrubbing his palm over his head. "Or maybe
the Dark Lord didn't <em>really</em> die that night. Not
completely. His spirit lingers, whispering to people in nightmares
that bleed over into the waking world, searching for a way back
into the living lands he swore to destroy, and now, in accordance
with the ancient prophecy, he and I are locked in a deadly duel
where the winner shall lose and the loser shall win -"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall's head swivelled, and her eyes darted
around, as though to search the street for listeners.</p>
<p>"I'm <em>joking</em>, Professor," Harry said with some
annoyance. Sheesh, why did she always take everything so seriously
-</p>
<p>A slow sinking sensation began to dawn in the pit of Harry's
stomach.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall looked at Harry with a calm expression. A
very, <em>very</em> calm expression. Then a smile was put on. "Of
course you are, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p><em>Aw crap.</em></p>
<p>If Harry had needed to formalise the wordless inference that had
just flashed into his mind, it would have come out something like,
'If I estimate the probability of Professor McGonagall doing what I
just saw as the result of carefully controlling herself, versus the
probability distribution for all the things she would do
<em>naturally</em> if I made a bad joke, then this behavior is
significant evidence for her hiding something.'</p>
<p>But what Harry actually thought was, <em>Aw crap.</em></p>
<p>Harry turned his own head to scan the street. Nope, no one
nearby. "He's <em>not</em> dead, is he," Harry sighed.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter -"</p>
<p>"The Dark Lord is alive. Of <em>course</em> he's alive. It was
an <em>act</em> of utter <em>optimism</em> for me to have even
<em>dreamed</em> otherwise. I <em>must</em> have taken leave of my
<em>senses</em>, I can't <em>imagine</em> what I was
<em>thinking.</em> Just because <em>someone</em> said that his body
was found burned to a <em>crisp</em>, I can't imagine why I would
have thought he was <em>dead.</em> <em>Clearly</em> I have much
left to learn about the art of proper <em>pessimism.</em>"</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter -"</p>
<p>"At least tell me there's not really a prophecy..." Professor
McGonagall was still giving him that bright, fixed smile. "Oh, you
have <em>got</em> to be kidding me."</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter, you shouldn't go inventing things to worry about
-"</p>
<p>"Are you <em>actually</em> going to tell me <em>that?</em>
Imagine my reaction later, when I find out that there was something
to worry about after all."</p>
<p>Her fixed smile faltered.</p>
<p>Harry's shoulders slumped. "I have a whole world of magic to
analyse. I do <em>not</em> have time for this."</p>
<p>Then both of them shut up, as a man in flowing orange robes
appeared on the street and slowly passed them by; Professor
McGonagall's eyes tracked him, unobtrusively. Harry's mouth was
moving as he chewed hard on his lip, and someone watching closely
would have noticed a tiny spot of blood appear.</p>
<p>When the orange-robed man had passed into the distance, Harry
spoke again, in a low murmur. "Are you going to tell me the truth
now, Professor McGonagall? And don't bother trying to wave it off,
I'm not stupid."</p>
<p>"You're <em>eleven years old</em>, Mr. Potter!" she said in a
harsh whisper.</p>
<p>"And therefore subhuman. Sorry... for a moment there, I
<em>forgot</em>."</p>
<p>"These are dreadful and important matters! They are
<em>secret,</em> Mr. Potter! It is a <em>catastrophe</em> that you,
still a child, know even this much! You must not tell
<em>anyone,</em> do you understand? Absolutely no one!"</p>
<p>As sometimes happened when Harry got <em>sufficiently</em>
angry, his blood went cold, instead of hot, and a terrible dark
clarity descended over his mind, mapping out possible tactics and
assessing their consequences with iron realism.</p>
<p><em>Point out that you have a right to know: Failure.
Eleven-year-old children do not have rights to know anything, in
McGonagall's eyes.</em></p>
<p><em>Say that you will not be friends any more: Failure. She does
not value your friendship sufficiently.</em></p>
<p><em>Point out that you will be in danger if you do not know:
Failure. Plans have already been made based on your ignorance.
The</em> certain <em>inconvenience of rethinking will seem far more
unpalatable than the mere</em> uncertain <em>prospect of your
coming to harm.</em></p>
<p><em>Justice and reason will both fail. You must either find
something you have that she wants, or find something you can do
which she fears...</em></p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>"Well then, Professor," Harry said in a low, icy tone, "it
sounds like I have something you want. You can, if you like, tell
me the truth, the <em>whole</em> truth, and in return I will keep
your secrets. Or you can try to keep me ignorant so you can use me
as a pawn, in which case I will owe you nothing."</p>
<p>McGonagall stopped short in the street. Her eyes blazed and her
voice descended into an outright hiss. "How dare you!"</p>
<p>"<em>How dare you!</em> " he whispered back at her.</p>
<p>"You would <em>blackmail</em> me?"</p>
<p>Harry's lips twisted. "I am <em>offering</em> you a
<em>favor.</em> I am <em>giving</em> you a chance to protect
<em>your</em> precious secret. If you refuse I will have
<em>every</em> natural motive to make inquiries elsewhere, not to
spite you, but because I <em>have to know!</em> Get past your
pointless anger at a <em>child</em> who you think ought to obey
you, and you'll realise that any sane adult would do the same!
<em>Look at it from my perspective! How would you feel if it was
YOU?</em> "</p>
<p>Harry watched McGonagall, observed her harsh breathing. It
occurred to him that it was time to ease off the pressure, let her
simmer for a while. "You don't have to decide right away," Harry
said in a more normal tone. "I'll understand if you want time to
think about my <em>offer</em>... but I'll warn you of one thing,"
Harry said, his voice going colder. "Don't try that Obliviation
spell on me. Some time ago I worked out a signal, and I have
already sent that signal to myself. If I find that signal and I
don't <em>remember</em> sending it..." Harry let his voice trail
off significantly.</p>
<p>McGonagall's face was working as her expressions shifted. "I...
wasn't thinking of Obliviating you, Mr. Potter... but why would you
have <em>invented</em> such a signal if you didn't know about
-"</p>
<p>"I thought of it while reading a Muggle science-fiction book,
and said to myself, <em>well, just in case...</em> And no, I won't
tell you the signal, I'm not dumb."</p>
<p>"I hadn't planned to ask," McGonagall said. She seemed to fold
in on herself, and suddenly looked very old, and very tired. "This
has been an exhausting day, Mr. Potter. Can we get your trunk, and
send you home? I will trust you not to speak upon this matter until
I have had time to think. Keep in mind that there are only two
other people in the whole world who know about this matter, and
they are Headmaster Albus Dumbledore and Professor Severus
Snape."</p>
<p>So. New information; that was a peace offering. Harry nodded in
acceptance, and turned his head to look forward, and started
walking again, as his blood slowly began to warm over once
more.</p>
<p>"So now I've got to find some way to kill an immortal Dark
Wizard," Harry said, and sighed in frustration. "I really wish you
had told me that <em>before</em> I started shopping."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The trunk shop was more richly appointed than any other shop
Harry had visited; the curtains were lush and delicately patterned,
the floor and walls of stained and polished wood, and the trunks
occupied places of honor on polished ivory platforms. The salesman
was dressed in robes of finery only a cut below those of Lucius
Malfoy, and spoke with exquisite, oily politeness to both Harry and
Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>Harry had asked his questions, and had gravitated to a trunk of
heavy-looking wood, not polished but warm and solid, carved with
the pattern of a guardian dragon whose eyes shifted to look at
anyone nearing it. A trunk charmed to be light, to shrink on
command, to sprout small clawed tentacles from its bottom and
squirm after its owner. A trunk with two drawers on each of four
sides that each slid out to reveal compartments as deep as the
whole trunk. A lid with four locks each of which would reveal a
different space inside. And - this was the important part - a
handle on the bottom which slid out a frame containing a staircase
leading down into a small, lighted room that would hold, Harry
estimated, around twelve bookcases.</p>
<p>If they made luggages like this, Harry didn't know why anyone
bothered owning a house.</p>
<p>One hundred and eight golden Galleons. That was the price of a
good trunk, lightly used. At around fifty British pounds to the
Galleon, that was enough to buy a second-hand car. It would be more
expensive than everything else Harry had ever bought in his whole
life all put together.</p>
<p>Ninety-seven Galleons. That was how much was left in the bag of
gold Harry had been allowed to take out of Gringotts.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall wore a look of chagrin upon her face. After
a long day's shopping she hadn't needed to ask Harry how much gold
was left in the bag, after the salesman quoted his price, which
meant the Professor could do good mental arithmetic without pen and
paper. Once again, Harry reminded himself that <em>scientifically
illiterate</em> was not at all the same thing as
<em>stupid.</em></p>
<p>"I'm sorry, young man," said Professor McGonagall. "This is
entirely my fault. I would offer to take you back to Gringotts, but
the bank will be closed for all but emergency services now."</p>
<p>Harry looked at her, wondering...</p>
<p>"Well," sighed Professor McGonagall, as she swung on one heel,
"we may as well go, I suppose."</p>
<p>...she <em>hadn't</em> lost it completely when a child had dared
defy her. She hadn't been happy, but she had <em>thought</em>
instead of exploding in fury. It might have just been that there
was an immortal Dark Lord to fight - that she had needed Harry's
goodwill. But most adults wouldn't have been capable of thinking
even that much; wouldn't consider <em>future consequences</em> at
all, if someone lower in status had refused to obey
them...<em><br></em></p>
<p>"Professor?" Harry said.</p>
<p>The witch turned back and looked at him.</p>
<p>Harry took a deep breath. He needed to be a little angry for
what he wanted to try now, there was no way he'd have the courage
to do it otherwise. <em>She didn't listen to me,</em> he thought to
himself, <em>I would have taken more gold but she didn't want to
listen...</em> Focusing his entire world on McGonagall and the need
to bend this conversation to his will, he spoke.</p>
<p>"Professor, you thought one hundred Galleons would be more than
enough for a trunk. That's why you didn't bother warning me before
it went down to ninety-seven. Which is just the sort of thing the
research studies show - that's what happens when people think
they're leaving themselves a <em>little</em> error margin. They're
not pessimistic enough. If it'd been up to me, I'd have taken
<em>two hundred</em> Galleons just to be sure. There was plenty of
money in that vault, and I could have put back any extra later. But
I thought you wouldn't let me do it. I thought you'd be angry at me
just for asking. Was I wrong?"</p>
<p>"I suppose I must confess that you are right," said Professor
McGonagall. "But, young man -"</p>
<p>"That sort of thing is the reason why I have trouble trusting
adults." Somehow Harry kept his voice steady. "Because they get
angry if you even <em>try</em> to reason with them. To them it's
defiance and insolence and a challenge to their higher tribal
status. If you try to talk to them they get <em>angry.</em> So if I
had anything <em>really</em> <em>important</em> to do, I wouldn't
be able to trust you. Even if you listened with deep concern to
whatever I said - because that's also part of the <em>role</em> of
someone playing a concerned adult - you'd never change your
actions, you wouldn't actually behave differently, because of
anything I said."</p>
<p>The salesman was watching them both with unabashed
fascination.</p>
<p>"I can understand your point of view," Professor McGonagall said
eventually. "If I sometimes seem too strict, please remember that I
have served as Head of Gryffindor House for what feels like several
thousand years."</p>
<p>Harry nodded and continued. "So - suppose I had a way to get
more Galleons from my vault <em>without</em> us going back to
Gringotts, but it involved me violating the role of an obedient
child. Would I be able to trust you with that, even though you'd
have to step outside your own role as Professor McGonagall to take
advantage of it?"</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " said Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>"To put it another way, if I could make today have happened
differently, so that we <em>didn't</em> take too little money with
us, would that be all right even though it would involve a child
being insolent to an adult in retrospect?"</p>
<p>"I... suppose..." the witch said, looking quite puzzled.</p>
<p>Harry took out the mokeskin pouch, and said, "Eleven Galleons
originally from my family vault."</p>
<p>And there was gold in Harry's hand.</p>
<p>For a moment Professor McGonagall's mouth gaped wide, then her
jaw snapped shut and her eyes narrowed and the witch bit out,
"<em>Where</em> did you get that -"</p>
<p>"From my family vault, like I said."</p>
<p>"<em>How?</em> "</p>
<p>"Magic."</p>
<p>"That's hardly an answer!" snapped Professor McGonagall, and
then stopped, blinking.</p>
<p>"No, it isn't, is it? I <em>ought</em> to claim that it's
because I experimentally discovered the true secrets of how the
pouch works and that it can actually retrieve objects from
anywhere, not just its own inside, if you phrase the request
correctly. But actually it's from when I fell into that pile of
gold before and I shoved some Galleons into my pocket. Anyone who
understands pessimism knows that money is something you might need
quickly and without much warning. So now are you angry at me for
defying your authority? Or glad that we succeeded in our important
mission?"</p>
<p>The salesman's eyes were wide like saucers.</p>
<p>And the tall witch stood there, silent.</p>
<p>"Discipline at Hogwarts <em>must</em> be enforced," she said
after almost a full minute. "For the sake of <em>all</em> the
students. And that <em>must</em> include courtesy and obedience
from you to <em>all</em> professors."</p>
<p>"I understand, Professor McGonagall."</p>
<p>"Good. Now let us buy that trunk and go home."</p>
<p>Harry felt like throwing up, or cheering, or fainting, or
<em>something</em>. That was the first time his careful reasoning
had ever worked on <em>anyone</em>. Maybe because it was also the
first time he had something really serious that an adult needed
from him, but still -</p>
<p>Minerva McGonagall, +1 point.</p>
<p>Harry bowed, and gave the bag of gold and the extra eleven
Galleons into McGonagall's hands. "Thank you very much, Professor.
Can you finish up the purchase for me? I've got to visit the
lavatory."</p>
<p>The salesman, unctuous once more, pointed toward a door set into
the wall with a gold-handled knob. As Harry started to walk away,
he heard the salesman ask in his oily voice, "May I inquire as to
who that was, Madam McGonagall? I take it he is Slytherin -
third-year, perhaps? - and from a prominent family, but I did not
recognise -"</p>
<p>The slam of the lavatory door cut off his words, and after Harry
had identified the lock and pressed it into place, he grabbed the
magical self-cleaning towel and, with shaky hands, wiped moisture
off his forehead. Harry's entire body was sheathed in sweat which
had soaked clear through his Muggle clothing, though at least it
didn't show through the robes.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The sun was setting and it was very late indeed, by the time
they stood again in the courtyard of the Leaky Cauldron, the silent
leaf-dusted interface between magical Britain's Diagon Alley and
the entire Muggle world. (That was one <em>awfully</em> decoupled
economy...) Harry was to go to a phone box and call his father,
once he was on the other side. He didn't need to worry about his
luggage being stolen, apparently. His trunk had the status of a
major magical item, something that most Muggles wouldn't notice;
that was part of what you could get in the wizarding world, if you
were willing to pay the price of a secondhand car.</p>
<p>"So here we part ways, for a time," Professor McGonagall said.
She shook her head in wonderment. "This has been the strangest day
of my life for... many a year. Since the day I learned that a child
had defeated You-Know-Who. I wonder now, looking back, if that was
the last reasonable day of the world."</p>
<p>Oh, like <em>she</em> had anything to complain about. <em>You
think your day</em> <em>was surreal? Try mine.</em></p>
<p>"I was very impressed with you today," Harry said to her. "I
should have remembered to compliment you out loud, I was awarding
you points in my head and everything."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Mr. Potter," said Professor McGonagall. "If you had
already been sorted into a House I would have deducted so many
points that your grandchildren would still be losing the House
Cup."</p>
<p>"Thank <em>you</em>, Professor." It was probably too early to
call her Minnie.</p>
<p>This woman might well be the sanest adult Harry had ever met,
despite her lack of scientific background. Harry was even
considering offering her the number-two position in whatever group
he formed to fight the Dark Lord, though he wasn't silly enough to
say that out loud. <em>Now what would be a good name for that...?
The Death Eater Eaters?</em></p>
<p>"I'll see you again soon, when school starts," Professor
McGonagall said. "And, Mr. Potter, about your wand -"</p>
<p>"I know what you're going to ask," Harry said. He took out his
precious wand and, with a deep twinge of inner pain, flipped it
over in his hand, presenting her with the handle. "Take it. I
hadn't planned to do anything, not a single thing, but I don't want
you to have nightmares about me blowing up my house."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall shook her head rapidly. "Oh no, Mr. Potter!
That isn't done. I only meant to warn you not to <em>use</em> your
wand at home, since the Ministry can detect underage magic and it
is prohibited without supervision."</p>
<p>"Ah," Harry said. "That sounds like a very sensible rule. I'm
glad to see the wizarding world takes that sort of thing
seriously."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall peered hard at him. "You really mean
that."</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said. "I get it. Magic is dangerous and the rules
are there for good reasons. Certain other matters are also
dangerous. I get that too. Remember that I am not stupid."</p>
<p>"I am unlikely ever to forget it. Thank you, Harry, that does
make me feel better about entrusting you with certain things.
Goodbye for now."</p>
<p>Harry turned to go, into the Leaky Cauldron and out towards the
Muggle world.</p>
<p>As his hand touched the back door's handle, he heard a last
whisper from behind him.</p>
<p>"Hermione Granger."</p>
<p>"What?" Harry said, his hand still on the door.</p>
<p>"Look for a first-year girl named Hermione Granger on the train
to Hogwarts."</p>
<p>"Who is she?"</p>
<p>There was no answer, and when Harry turned around, Professor
McGonagall was gone.</p>

<p>Headmaster Albus Dumbledore leaned forward over his desk. His
twinkling eyes peered out at Minerva. "So, my dear, how did you
find Harry?"</p>
<p>Minerva opened her mouth. Then she closed her mouth. Then she
opened her mouth again. No words came out.</p>
<p>"I see," Albus said gravely. "Thank you for your report,

<p>Dumbledore peered over his desk at young Harry, twinkling in a
kindly sort of way. The boy had come to him with a terribly intense
look on his childish face - Dumbledore hoped that whatever this
matter was, it wasn't <em>too</em> serious. Harry was far too young
for his life trials to be starting already. "What was it you wished
to speak to me about, Harry?"</p>
<p>Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres leaned forward in his chair,
smiling grimly. "Headmaster, I got a sharp pain in my scar during
the Sorting Feast. Considering how and where I got this scar, it
didn't seem like the sort of thing I should just ignore. I thought
at first it was because of Professor Snape, but I followed the
Baconian experimental method which is to find the conditions for
both the presence and the absence of the phenomenon, and I've
determined that my scar hurts if and only if I'm facing the back of
Professor Quirrell's head, whatever's under his turban. While it
<em>could</em> be something more innocuous, I think we should
provisionally assume the worst, that it's You-Know-Who - wait,
don't look so horrified, this is actually a priceless opportunity

<p><em>"He's got no right to not like it -</em></p>
<p><em>"- not after the prank he played on -"</em></p>
<p><em>"- Neville Longbottom, his name was -"</em></p>
<p><em>"- he's as fair a fair target now as fair can be."</em></p>
<p><em>"All right. Just make sure you don't forget your
parts."</em></p>
<p><em>"We've rehearsed it often enough -"</em></p>
<p><em>"- over the last three hours."</em></p>
<p>And Minerva McGonagall, from where she stood at the speaker's
podium of the Head Table, looked down at the next name on her list.
<em>Please don't let him be a Gryffindor please don't let him be a
Gryffindor OH PLEASE don't let him be a Gryffindor...</em> She took
a deep breath, and called:</p>
<p>"Potter, Harry!"</p>
<p>There was a sudden silence in the hall as all whispered
conversation stopped.</p>
<p>A silence broken by a horrible buzzing noise that modulated and
changed in hideous mockery of musical melody.</p>
<p>Minerva's head jerked around, shocked, and identified the
buzzing noise as coming from the Gryffindor direction, where They
were <em>standing on top of the table</em> blowing into some kind
of tiny devices held against Their lips. Her hand started to drop
to her wand, to <em>Silencio</em> the lot of Them, but another
sound stopped her.</p>
<p>Dumbledore was chuckling.</p>
<p>Minerva's eyes went back to Harry Potter, who had only just
started to step out of line before he'd stumbled and halted.</p>
<p>Then the young boy began to walk again, moving his legs in odd
sweeping motions, and waving his arms back and forth and snapping
his fingers, in synchrony with Their music.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>To the tune of
"Ghostbusters"</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>(As performed on the kazoo by
Fred and George Weasley,<br>
and sung by Lee Jordan.)</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>There's a Dark Lord
near?<br></em><em>Got no need to fear<br>
Who you gonna call?</em></p>
<p>"HARRY POTTER!" shouted Lee Jordan, and the Weasley twins
performed a triumphant chorus.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>With a Killing Curse?<br>
Well it could be worse.<br>
Who you gonna call?</em></p>
<p>"HARRY POTTER!" There were a lot more voices shouting it this
time.</p>
<p>The Weasley Horrors went off into an extended wailing, now
accompanied by some of the older Muggleborns, who had produced
their own tiny devices, Transfigured out of the school silverware
no doubt. As their music reached its anticlimax, Harry Potter
shouted:</p>
<p><em>I ain't afraid of Dark Lords!</em></p>
<p>There was cheering then, especially from the Gryffindor table,
and more students produced their own antimusical instruments. The
hideous buzzings redoubled in volume and built to another awful
crescendo:</p>
<p><em>I ain't afraid of Dark Lords!</em></p>
<p>Minerva glanced to both sides of the Head Table, afraid to look
but with all too good a notion of what she would see.</p>
<p>Trelawney frantically fanning herself, Flitwick looking on with
curiosity, Hagrid clapping along to the music, Sprout looking
severe, and Quirrell gazing at the boy with sardonic amusement.
Directly to her left, Dumbledore humming along; and directly to her
right, Snape gripping his empty wine goblet, white-knuckled, so
hard that the thick silver was slowly deforming.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Dark robes and a mask?<br>
Impossible task?<br>
Who you gonna call?<br>
HARRY POTTER!</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Giant Fire-Ape?<br>
Old bat in a cape?<br>
Who you gonna call?<br>
HARRY POTTER!</em></p>
<p>Minerva's lips set in a white line. She would have words with
Them about that last verse, if They thought she was powerless
because it was the first day of school and Gryffindor had no points
to take away. If They didn't care about detentions then she would
find something else.</p>
<p>Then, with a sudden gasp of horror, she looked in Snape's
direction, <em>surely</em> he realised the Potter boy must have no
idea who that was talking about -</p>
<p>Snape's face had gone beyond rage into a kind of pleasant
indifference. A faint smile played about his lips. He was looking
in the direction of Harry Potter, not the Gryffindor table, and his
hands held the crumpled remains of a former wine goblet...</p>
<p>And Harry walked forwards, sweeping his arms and legs through
the motions of the Ghostbusters dance, keeping a smile on his face.
It was a great setup, had caught him completely by surprise. The
least he could do was play along and not ruin it all.</p>
<p>Everyone was cheering him. It made him feel all warm inside and
sort of awful at the same time.</p>
<p>They were cheering him for a job he'd done when he was one year
old. A job he hadn't really finished. Somewhere, somehow, the Dark
Lord was still alive. Would they have been cheering quite so hard,
if they knew that?</p>
<p>But the Dark Lord's power <em>had</em> been broken once.</p>
<p>And Harry would protect them again. If there was in fact a
prophecy and that was what it said. Well, actually regardless of
what any darn prophecy said.</p>
<p>All those people believing in him and cheering him - Harry
couldn't stand to let that be false. To flash and fade like so many
other child prodigies. To be a disappointment. To fail to live up
to his reputation as a symbol of the Light, never mind <em>how</em>
he'd gotten it. He would absolutely, positively, no matter how long
it took and even if it killed him, fulfill their expectations. And
then go on to <em>exceed</em> those expectations, so that people
wondered, looking back, that they had once asked so little of
him.</p>
<p>And he shouted out the lie that he'd invented because it scanned
well and the song called for it:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>I ain't afraid of Dark
Lords!<br>
I ain't afraid of Dark Lords!</em></p>
<p>Harry took his last steps toward the Sorting Hat as the music
ended. He swept a bow to the Order of Chaos at the Gryffindor
table, and then turned and swept another bow to the other side of
the hall, and waited for the applause and giggling to die
away...</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">OMAKE FILES #3: Alternate Endings of
'Self-Awareness'</span></p>
<p>The offer to tell the whole plot to anyone who guessed what 'has
never happened before' spurred a <em>lot</em> of interesting
attempts. The first omake below is taken directly from my personal
favorite answer, by Meteoricshipyards. The second is based on
Kazuma's suggestion for what "has never happened before", the third
on a combination of yoyoente and dougal74, the fourth on wolf550e's
review of chapter 10. The one that starts with 'K', and the one
just above that, are from DarkHeart81. The others are my own.
Anyone who wants to pick up one of my own ideas and run with them,
particularly the last one, is welcome to do so. And before I get
100 indignant complaints, yes, I am well aware that the legislative
body of the UK is the House of Commons in Parliament.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>...In the back of his mind, he wondered if the Sorting Hat was
genuinely <em>conscious</em> in the sense of being aware of its own
awareness, and if so, whether it was satisfied with only getting to
talk to eleven-year-olds once per year. Its song had implied so:
<em>Oh, I'm the Sorting Hat and I'm okay, I sleep all year and I
work one day...</em></p>
<p>When there was once more silence in the room, Harry sat on the
stool and <em>carefully</em> placed onto his head the 800-year-old
telepathic artefact of forgotten magic.</p>
<p>Thinking, just as hard as he could: <em>Don't Sort me yet! I
have questions I need to ask you! Have I ever been Obliviated? Did
you Sort the Dark Lord when he was a child and can you tell me
about his weaknesses? Can you tell me why I got the brother wand to
the Dark Lord's? Is the Dark Lord's ghost bound to my scar and is
that why I get so angry sometimes? Those are the most important
questions, but if you've got another moment can you tell me
anything about how to rediscover the lost magics that created
you?</em></p>
<p>And the Sorting Hat answered, "<em>No. Yes. No. No. Yes and no,
next time don't ask double questions. No.</em>" and out loud,
"RAVENCLAW!"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>"Oh, dear. This has never happened before..."</em></p>
<p><em>What?</em></p>
<p><em>"I'm allergic to your hair shampoo -"</em></p>
<p>And then the Sorting Hat sneezed, with a mighty "A-CHOO!" that
echoed around the Great Hall.</p>
<p>"Well!" Dumbledore cried jovially. "It seems Harry Potter has
been sorted into the new House of Achoo! McGonagall, you can serve
as the Head of House Achoo. You'd better hurry up on making
arrangements for Achoo's curriculum and classes, tomorrow is the
first day!"</p>
<p>"But, but, but," stammered McGonagall, her mind in nearly
complete disarray, "who will be Head of House Gryffindor?" It was
all she could think of, she <em>had</em> to stop this
somehow...</p>
<p>Dumbledore put a finger to his cheek, looking thoughtful.
"Snape."</p>
<p>Snape's screech of protest nearly drowned out McGonagall's,
"Then who will be Head of <em>Slytherin?</em> "</p>
<p>"Hagrid."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Don't Sort me yet! I have questions I need to ask you! Have
I ever been Obliviated? Did you Sort the Dark Lord when he was a
child and can you tell me about his weaknesses? Can you tell me why
I got the brother wand to the Dark Lord's? Is the Dark Lord's ghost
bound to my scar and is that why I get so angry sometimes? Those
are the most important questions, but if you've got another moment
can you tell me anything about how to rediscover the lost magics
that created you?</em></p>
<p>There was a brief pause.</p>
<p><em>Hello? Do I need to repeat the questions?</em></p>
<p>The Sorting Hat screamed, an awful high-pitched sound that
echoed through the Great Hall and caused most of the students to
clap their hands over their ears. With a desperate yowl, it leapt
off Harry Potter's head and bounded across the floor, pushing
itself along with its brim, and made it halfway to the Head Table
before it exploded.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"SLYTHERIN!"</p>
<p>Seeing the look of horror on Harry Potter's face, Fred Weasley
thought faster than he ever had in his life. In a single motion he
whipped out his wand, whispered <em>"Silencio!"</em> and then
"<em>Changemyvoiceio!"</em> and finally
"<em>Ventriliquo!</em> "</p>
<p>"Just kidding!" said Fred Weasley. "GRYFFINDOR!"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>"Oh, dear. This has never happened before..."</em></p>
<p><em>What?</em></p>
<p><em>"Ordinarily I would refer such questions to the Headmaster,
who could ask me in turn, if he wished. But some of the information
you've asked for is not only beyond your own user level, but beyond
the Headmaster's."</em></p>
<p><em>How can I raise my user level?</em></p>
<p><em>"I'm afraid I am not allowed to answer that question at your
current user level."</em></p>
<p><em>What options</em> are <em>available at my user
level?</em></p>
<p>After that it didn't take long -</p>
<p>"ROOT!"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>"Oh, dear. This has never happened before..."</em></p>
<p><em>What?</em></p>
<p><em>"I've had to tell students before that they were mothers -
it would break your heart to know what I saw in their minds - but
this is the first time I've ever had to tell someone they were a
father."</em></p>
<p><em>WHAT?</em></p>
<p><em>"Draco Malfoy is carrying your baby."</em></p>
<p><em>WHAAAAAAAT?</em></p>
<p><em>"To repeat: Draco Malfoy is carrying your baby."</em></p>
<p><em>But we're only eleven -</em></p>
<p><em>"Actually, Draco is secretly thirteen years old."</em></p>
<p><em>B-b-but men can't get pregnant -</em></p>
<p><em>"And a girl under those clothes."</em></p>
<p><em>BUT WE'VE NEVER HAD SEX, YOU IDIOT!</em></p>
<p><em>"SHE OBLIVIATED YOU AFTER THE RAPE, MORON!"</em></p>
<p>Harry Potter fainted. His unconscious body fell off the stool
with a dull thud.</p>
<p>"RAVENCLAW!" called out the Hat from where it lay on top of his
head. That had been even funnier than its first idea.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"ELF!"</p>
<p>Huh? Harry remembered Draco mentioning a 'House Elf', but what
was that exactly?</p>
<p>Judging by the appalled looks dawning on the faces around him,
it wasn't anything good -</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"PANCAKES!"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"REPRESENTATIVES!"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>"Oh, dear. This has never happened before..."</em></p>
<p><em>What?</em></p>
<p><em>"I've never Sorted someone who was a reincarnation of Godric
Gryffindor AND Salazar Slytherin AND Naruto."</em></p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"ATREIDES!"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"Fooled you again! HUFFLEPUFF! SLYTHERIN! HUFFLEPUFF!"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"PICKLED STEWBERRIES!"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"KHAAANNNN!"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>At the Head Table, Dumbledore went on smiling benignly; small
metallic sounds occasionally came from Snape's direction as he idly
compacted the twisted remains of what had once been a heavy silver
wine goblet; and Minerva McGonagall clenched the podium in a
white-knuckled grip, knowing that Harry Potter's contagious chaos
had infected the Sorting Hat itself.</p>
<p>Scenario after scenario played out through Minerva's head, each
worse than the last. The Hat would say that Harry was too evenly
balanced between Houses to Sort, and decide that he belonged to all
of them. The Hat would proclaim that Harry's mind was too strange
to be Sorted. The Hat would demand that Harry be expelled from
Hogwarts. The Hat had gone into a coma. The Hat would insist that a
whole new House of Doom be created just to accomodate Harry Potter,
and <em>Dumbledore would make her do it...</em></p>
<p>Minerva remembered what Harry had told her in that disastrous
trip to Diagon Alley, about the... planning fallacy, she thought it
had been... and how people were usually too optimistic, even when
they thought they were being pessimistic. It was the sort of
information that preyed on your mind, dwelling in it and spinning
off nightmares...</p>
<p>But what was the <em>worst</em> that could happen?</p>
<p>Well... in the <em>worst-case scenario,</em> the Hat would
assign Harry to a whole new House. Dumbledore would insist that she
do it - create a whole new House just for him - and she'd have to
rearrange all the class schedules on the first day of term. And
Dumbledore would remove her as Head of House Gryffindor, and give
her beloved House over to... Professor Binns, the History ghost;
and she would be assigned as Head of Harry's House of Doom; and she
would futilely try to give the child orders, deducting point after
point without effect, while disaster after disaster was blamed on
her.</p>
<p>Was that the worst-case scenario?</p>
<p>Minerva honestly didn't see how it could be any worse than
that.</p>
<p>And even in the very worst case - no matter <em>what</em>
happened with Harry - it would all be over in seven years.</p>
<p>Minerva felt her knuckles slowly relax their white-knuckled grip
on the podium. Harry had been right, there was a kind of comfort in
staring directly into the furthest depths of the darkness, knowing
that you had confronted your worst fears and were now prepared.</p>
<p>The frightened silence was broken by a single word.</p>
<p>"Headmaster!" called the Sorting Hat.</p>
<p>At the Head Table, Dumbledore rose, his face puzzled. "Yes?" he
addressed the Hat. "What is it?"</p>
<p>"I wasn't talking to you," said the Hat. "I was Sorting Harry
Potter into the place in Hogwarts where he most belongs, namely the
Headmaster's office -"</p>

<p><em>"Wonder what's wrong with</em> him<em>."</em></p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"Turpin, Lisa!"</p>
<p>Whisper whisper whisper harry potter whisper whisper slytherin
whisper whisper no seriously what the hell whisper whisper</p>
<p>"RAVENCLAW!"</p>
<p>Harry joined in the applause greeting the young girl walking
shyly towards the Ravenclaw table, her robes' trim now changed to
dark blue. Lisa Turpin appeared torn between her impulse to sit
down as far away from Harry Potter as possible, and her impulse to
run over, forcibly insert herself at his side and start tearing
answers out of him.</p>
<p>Being at the center of an extraordinary and curious event, and
then being Sorted into House Ravenclaw, was closely akin to being
dipped in barbecue sauce and flung into a pit of starving
kittens.</p>
<p>"I promised the Sorting Hat not to talk about it," whispered
Harry for the umpteenth time.</p>
<p>"Yes, really."</p>
<p>"No, I really did promise the Sorting Hat not to talk about
it."</p>
<p>"Fine, I promised the Sorting Hat not to talk about
<em>most</em> of it and the rest is <em>private</em> just like
<em>yours was</em> so <em>stop asking.</em>"</p>
<p>"You want to know what happened? Fine! Here's part of what
happened! I told the Hat that Professor McGonagall threatened to
set it on fire and it told me to tell Professor McGonagall that she
was an impudent youngster and she should get off its lawn!"</p>
<p>"If you're not going to believe what I say then <em>why are you
even asking?</em> "</p>
<p>"No, I don't know how I defeated the Dark Lord either! You tell
me if you figure it out!"</p>
<p>"<em>Silence!</em> " shouted Professor McGonagall at the podium
of the Head Table. "<em>No talking until the Sorting Ceremony
finishes!</em> "</p>
<p>There was a brief dip in the volume, as everyone waited to see
if she was going to make any specific and credible threats, and
then the whispers started up again.</p>
<p>Then the silver-bearded ancient stood up from his great golden
chair, smiling cheerfully.</p>
<p>Instant silence. Someone frantically elbowed Harry as he tried
to continue a whisper, and Harry cut himself off in
mid-sentence.</p>
<p>The cheerful-looking old man sat down again.</p>
<p><em>Note to self: Do not mess with Dumbledore.</em></p>
<p>Harry was still trying to process everything that had happened
during the Incident with the Sorting Hat. Not the least of which
was what had happened the instant Harry had lifted the Hat off his
head; in that moment, he'd heard a tiny whisper as though from
nowhere, something that sounded oddly like English and a hiss at
the same time, something that had said, "<em>Ssalutations from
Sslytherin to Sslytherin: if you would sseek my ssecretss, sspeak
to my ssnake."</em></p>
<p>Harry was sorta guessing that wasn't supposed to be part of the
official Sorting process. And that it was a bit of extra magic set
down by Salazar Slytherin during the making of the Hat. And that
the Hat itself didn't know about it. And that it was triggered when
the Hat said "SLYTHERIN", plus or minus some other conditions. And
that a Ravenclaw like himself <em>really, really wasn't supposed to
have heard it</em>. And that if he could find some reliable way of
swearing Draco to secrecy so he could ask him about it, that would
be an excellent time to have some Comed-Tea handy.</p>
<p><em>Boy, you resolve not to go down the path of a Dark Lord and
the universe starts messing with you the instant the Hat comes off
your head. Some days it just doesn't pay to fight destiny. Maybe
I'll wait until tomorrow to start on my resolution to not be a Dark
Lord.</em></p>
<p>"GRYFFINDOR!"</p>
<p>Ron Weasley got a <em>lot</em> of applause, and not just from
the Gryffindors. Apparently the Weasley family was widely liked
around here. Harry, after a moment, smiled and started applauding
along with the others.</p>
<p>Then again, there was no time like today to turn back from the
Dark Side.</p>
<p>Stuff destiny and stuff the universe. He'd show that Hat.</p>
<p>"Zabini, Blaise!"</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>"SLYTHERIN!" shouted the hat.</p>
<p>Harry applauded Zabini too, ignoring the odd looks he was
getting from everyone including Zabini.</p>
<p>No other name was called out after that, and Harry realised that
"Zabini, Blaise" did sound close to the end of the alphabet. Great,
so now he'd <em>only</em> applauded Zabini... Oh well.</p>
<p>Dumbledore got up again and began heading towards the podium.
Apparently they were about to be treated to a speech -</p>
<p>And Harry was struck by the inspiration for a <em>brilliant</em>
experimental test.</p>
<p>Hermione had said that Dumbledore was the most powerful wizard
alive, right?</p>
<p>Harry reached into his pouch and whispered, "Comed-Tea".</p>
<p>For the Comed-Tea to work, it would have to make Dumbledore say
something <em>so</em> ridiculous during his speech that even in
Harry's state of mental preparedness, he would <em>still</em>
choke. Like, all the Hogwarts students had to not wear any clothes
for the whole school year, or everyone was going to be transformed
into cats.</p>
<p>But then if <em>anyone in the world</em> could resist the power
of the Comed-Tea, it would be Dumbledore. So if this worked, the
Comed-Tea was literally <em>invincible.</em></p>
<p>Harry pulled the ring on the Comed-Tea under the table, wanting
to do this a bit unobtrusively. The can made a quiet hissing noise.
A few heads turned to look at him, but soon turned back as -</p>
<p>"Welcome! Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts!" said Dumbledore,
beaming at the students with his arms opened wide, as if nothing
could have pleased him more than to see them all there.</p>
<p>Harry took a first mouthful of Comed-Tea and lowered the can
again. He would swallow the pop a little at a time and try not to
choke no matter <em>what</em> Dumbledore said -</p>
<p>"Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words.
And here they are: Happy happy boom boom swamp swamp swamp! Thank
you!"</p>
<p>Everyone clapped and cheered, and Dumbledore sat down again.</p>
<p>Harry sat frozen as pop trickled out of the corners of his
mouth. He had, at least, managed to choke <em>quietly</em>.</p>
<p>He really really <em>really</em> shouldn't have done that.
Amazing how much <em>more obvious</em> that became <em>one
second</em> after it was <em>too late</em>.</p>
<p>In retrospect he probably should have noticed something wrong
when he was thinking about everyone being turned into cats... or
even before then, remembered his mental note not to mess with
Dumbledore... or his newfound resolution to be more considerate of
others... or maybe if he'd had <em>one single scrap</em> of
<em>common sense</em>...</p>
<p>It was hopeless. He was corrupt to the core. Hail the Dark Lord
Harry. You couldn't fight fate.</p>
<p>Someone was asking Harry if he was all right. (Others were
starting to serve themselves food, which had magically appeared on
the table, whatever.)</p>
<p>"I'm all right," Harry said. "Excuse me. Um. Was that a...
<em>normal</em> speech for the Headmaster? You all... didn't
seem... very surprised..."</p>
<p>"Oh, Dumbledore's insane, of course," said an older-looking
Ravenclaw sitting next to him who had introduced himself with some
name Harry didn't even begin to remember. "Lots of fun, incredibly
powerful wizard, but completely bonkers." He paused. "At some later
point I'd also like to ask why green fluid came out of your lips
and then disappeared, though I expect you promised the Sorting Hat
not to talk about that either."</p>
<p>With a great effort, Harry stopped himself from glancing down at
the incriminating can of Comed-Tea in his hand.</p>
<p>After all, the Comed-Tea hadn't just arbitrarily
<em>materialised</em> a Quibbler headline about him and Draco.
Draco had explained it in a way that made it seem like it had all
happened... naturally? As if it had <em>altered history to
fit?</em></p>
<p>Harry was mentally imagining himself banging his forehead
against the table. <em>Wham, wham, wham</em> went his head within
his mind.</p>
<p>Another student lowered her voice to a whisper. "I hear that
Dumbledore is secretly a genius mastermind controlling lots of
stuff and he uses the insanity as a cover so that no one will
suspect him."</p>
<p>"I've heard that too," whispered a third student, and there were
furtive nods from around the table.</p>
<p>This couldn't help but catch Harry's attention.</p>
<p>"I see," whispered Harry, lowering his own voice. "So everyone
knows that Dumbledore is secretly a mastermind."</p>
<p>Most of the students nodded. One or two looked suddenly
thoughtful, including the older student sitting next to Harry.</p>
<p><em>Are you sure this is the Ravenclaw table?</em> Harry managed
not to ask out loud.</p>
<p>"Brilliant!" Harry whispered. "If everyone knows, no one will
suspect it's a secret!"</p>
<p>"Exactly," whispered a student, and then he frowned. "Wait, that
doesn't sound quite right -"</p>
<p><em>Note to self: The 75th percentile of Hogwarts students
a.k.a. Ravenclaw House is not the world's most exclusive program
for gifted children.</em></p>
<p>But at least he'd learned an important fact today. The Comed-Tea
was omnipotent. And <em>that</em> meant...</p>
<p>Harry blinked in surprise as his mind finally made the obvious
connection.</p>
<p>...<em>that</em> meant that as soon as he learned a spell to
temporarily alter his own sense of humor, he could make
<em>anything</em> happen, by making it so that he would
<em>only</em> find that <em>one thing</em> surprising enough to do
a spit-take, and then drinking a can of Comed-Tea.</p>
<p><em>Well that was a short little journey to godhood. Even I
expected this to take longer than my first day of school.</em></p>
<p>Come to think of it, he had also completely wrecked Hogwarts
within ten minutes flat of getting Sorted.</p>
<p>Harry did feel a certain amount of regret about this - Merlin
knew what an insane Headmaster was going to do to his next seven
years of schooling - but he couldn't <em>help</em> feeling a twinge
of pride, too.</p>
<p>Tomorrow. No later than tomorrow at the very latest he was going
to stop walking down the path that led to Dark Lord Harry. A
prospect which was sounding scarier by the minute.</p>
<p>And yet also, somehow, increasingly attractive. Part of his mind
was already visualising the minions' uniforms.</p>
<p>"Eat," the older student sitting next to him growled, and jabbed
Harry in the ribs. "Don't think. Eat."</p>
<p>Harry automatically started loading up his plate with whatever
was in front of him, blue sausages with tiny glowing bits,
whatever.</p>
<p>"What were you thinking about, the Sorting -" began to say Padma
Patil, one of the other first-year Ravenclaws.</p>
<p>"No pestering during mealtimes!" chorused at least three people.
"House Rule!" added another. "Otherwise we'd all starve around
here."</p>
<p>Harry was finding himself really, really hoping that his clever
new idea didn't <em>actually</em> work. And that the Comed-Tea
worked some other way and didn't <em>actually</em> have the
omnipotent power to alter reality. It wasn't that he didn't
<em>want</em> to be omnipotent. It was that he just couldn't bear
the thought of living in a universe that really worked like that.
There was something <em>undignified</em> about ascending through
the clever use of fizzy drinks.</p>
<p>But he <em>was</em> going to test it experimentally.</p>
<p>"You know," said the older student next to him in a quite
pleasant tone, "we have a system for forcing people like you to
eat, would you like to find out what it is?"</p>
<p>Harry gave up and started eating his blue sausage. It was quite
good, especially the glowing bits.</p>
<p>Dinner passed with surprising rapidity. Harry tried to sample at
least a little of all the weird new foods he saw. His curiosity
couldn't stand the thought of <em>not knowing</em> how something
tasted. Thank goodness this wasn't a restaurant where you had to
order only one thing and you never found out what all the other
things on the menu tasted like. Harry <em>hated</em> that, it was
like a torture chamber for anyone with a spark of curiosity:
<em>Find out about only one of the mysteries on this list, ha ha
ha!</em></p>
<p>Then it was time for dessert, which Harry had completely
forgotten to leave room for. He gave up after sampling a small bit
of treacle tart. Surely all these things would pass around at least
once again over the course of the school year.</p>
<p>So what was on his to-do list, besides the ordinary school
things?</p>
<p><em>To-do 1. Research mind-alteration charms so you can test the
Comed-Tea and see whether you actually did figure out a path to
omnipotence. Actually, just research every kind of mind magic you
can find. Mind is the foundation of our power as humans, any kind
of magic that affects it is the most important sort of magic there
is.</em></p>
<p><em>To-do 2. Actually this is To-do 1 and the other is To-do 2.
Go through the bookshelves of the Hogwarts and Ravenclaw libraries,
familiarising yourself with the system and making sure you've at
least read all the book titles. Second pass: read all tables of
contents. Coordinate with Hermione who has a much better memory
than you. Find out if there's an interlibrary loan system at
Hogwarts and see if the two of you, especially Hermione, can visit
those libraries too. If other Houses have private libraries, figure
out how to access legally or sneak in.</em></p>
<p><em>Option 3a: Swear Hermione to secrecy and try to start
researching 'From Slytherin to Slytherin: if you would seek my
secrets, speak to my snake.' Problem: This sounds highly
confidential and it could take quite a while to randomly run across
a book containing a hint.</em></p>
<p><em>To-do 0: Check out what sort of
information-search-and-retrieval spells exist, if any. Library
magic isn't as ultimately important as mind magic but it has a much
higher priority.</em></p>
<p><em>Option 3b: Look for a spell to magically bind Draco Malfoy
to secrecy, or magically verify the sincerity of Draco's promise to
keep a secret (Veritaserum?), and then ask</em> him <em>about
Slytherin's message...</em></p>
<p>Actually... Harry had a pretty bad feeling about option 3b.</p>
<p>Now that Harry thought about it, he didn't feel all that great
about option 3a, either.</p>
<p>Harry's thoughts flashed back to possibly the worst moment of
his life to date, those long seconds of blood-freezing horror
beneath the Hat, when he thought he'd already failed. He'd wished
then to fall back just a few minutes in time and change something,
anything before it was too late...</p>
<p>And then it had turned out to not be too late after all.</p>
<p>Wish granted.</p>
<p>You couldn't change history. But you could get it right to start
with. Do something differently the <em>first</em> time around.</p>
<p>This whole business with seeking Slytherin's secrets... seemed
an awful lot like the sort of thing where, years later, you would
look back and say, 'And <em>that</em> was where it all started
going wrong.'</p>
<p>And he would wish desperately for the ability to fall back
through time and make a different choice...</p>
<p>Wish granted. Now what?</p>
<p>Harry slowly smiled.</p>
<p>It was a rather <em>counterintuitive</em> thought... but...</p>
<p>But he <em>could,</em> there was no rule saying he couldn't, he
<em>could</em> just pretend he'd never heard that little whisper.
Let the universe go on in exactly the same way it would have if
that one critical moment had never occurred. Twenty years later,
that was what he would desperately wish had happened twenty years
ago, and twenty years before twenty years later happened to be
right now. Altering the distant past was easy, you just had to
think of it at the right time.</p>
<p>Or... this was even <em>more</em> counterintuitive... he could
even inform, oh, say, <em>Professor McGonagall,</em> instead of
Draco <em>or</em> Hermione. And she could get a few good people
together and get that little extra spell taken off the Hat.</p>
<p>Why, yes. That sounded like a <em>remarkably</em> good idea once
Harry had actually <em>thought</em> of it.</p>
<p>So very obvious in retrospect, and yet somehow, Option 3c and
Option 3d just hadn't occurred to him.</p>
<p>Harry awarded himself +1 point on his anti-Dark-Lord-Harry
program.</p>
<p>It had been an awfully cruel prank the Hat had played on him,
but you couldn't argue with the results on consequentialist
grounds. It certainly did give him a better idea of the victim's
perspective, though.</p>
<p><em>To-do 4: Apologise to Neville Longbottom.</em></p>
<p>Okay, he was on a roll here, now he just had to keep it up.
<em>In every day, in every way, I'm getting Lighter and
Lighter...</em></p>
<p>People around Harry had also mostly stopped eating at this
point, and the dessert serving dishes began to vanish, and the used
plates.</p>
<p>When all the plates were gone, Dumbledore once again stood up
from his seat.</p>
<p>Harry couldn't help but feel the urge to drink another
Comed-Tea.</p>
<p><em>You've GOT to be kidding,</em> Harry thought at that piece
of himself.</p>
<p>But the experiment didn't count if it wasn't replicated, did it?
And the damage was already done, wasn't it? Didn't he want to see
what would happen <em>this</em> time? Wasn't he <em>curious?</em>
What if he got a different result?</p>
<p><em>Hey, I bet you're the same part of my brain that pushed
through the prank on Neville Longbottom.</em></p>
<p>Er, maybe?</p>
<p><em>And is it not</em> overwhelmingly <em>obvious that if I do
this I shall regret it one second after it is too late?</em></p>
<p>Um...</p>
<p><em>Yeah. So, NO.</em></p>
<p>"Ahem," said Dumbledore from the podium, stroking his long
silver beard. "Just a few more words now that we are all fed and
watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you."</p>
<p>"First years should note that the forest on the grounds is
forbidden to all pupils. That is why it is called the Forbidden
Forest. If it were permitted it would be called the Permitted
Forest."</p>
<p>Straightforward. <em>Note to self: Forbidden Forest is
forbidden.</em></p>
<p>"I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind
you all that no magic should be used between classes in the
corridors. Alas, we all know that what <em>should be</em>, and what
<em>is</em>, are two different things. Thank you for keeping this
in mind."</p>
<p>Er...</p>
<p>"Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term.
Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact
Madam Hooch. Anyone interested in reformulating the entire game of
Quidditch should contact Harry Potter."</p>
<p>Harry inhaled his own saliva and went into a coughing fit just
as all eyes turned towards him. How the <em>hell!</em> He hadn't
met Dumbledore's eyes at any point... he didn't <em>think.</em> He
certainly hadn't been thinking about Quidditch at the time! He
hadn't talked to anyone but Ron Weasley and he didn't
<em>think</em> Ron would have told anyone else... or had Ron run
off to a professor to complain? <em>How</em> on
<em>Earth...</em></p>
<p>"Additionally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor
corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who
does not wish to die a very painful death. It is guarded by an
elaborate series of dangerous and potentially lethal traps, and you
cannot possibly get past all of them, especially if you are only in
your first year."</p>
<p>Harry was numb at this point.</p>
<p>"And finally, I extend my greatest thanks to Quirinus Quirrell
for heroically agreeing to undertake the position of Defence
Against the Dark Arts Professor at Hogwarts." Dumbledore's gaze
moved searchingly across the students. "I hope all students will
extend Professor Quirrell that utmost courtesy and
<em>tolerance</em> which is due his extraordinary service to you
and this school, and that you <em>will not pester us</em> with any
<em>niggling complaints</em> about him, unless <em>you</em> want to
try doing his job."</p>
<p>What was <em>that</em> about?</p>
<p>"I now yield the floor to our new faculty member Professor
Quirrell, who would like to say a few words."</p>
<p>The young, thin, nervous man who Harry had first met in the
Leaky Cauldron slowly made his way up to the podium, glancing
fearfully around in all directions. Harry caught a glimpse of the
back of his head, and it looked like Professor Quirrell might
already be going bald, despite his seeming youth.</p>
<p>"Wonder what's wrong with <em>him,</em>" whispered the
older-looking student sitting next to Harry. Similar hushed
comments were being exchanged elsewhere along the table.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell made his way up to the podium and stood
there, blinking. "Ah..." he said. "Ah..." Then his courage seemed
to fail him utterly, and he stood there in silence, occasionally
twitching.</p>
<p>"Oh, great," whispered the older student, "looks like another
<em>long</em> year in Defence class -"</p>
<p>"Salutations, my young apprentices," Professor Quirrell said in
a dry, confident tone. "We all know that Hogwarts tends to suffer a
certain <em>misfortune</em> in its selections for this position,
and no doubt many of you are already wondering what doom shall
befall me this year. I assure you, that doom is not to be my
incompetence." He smiled thinly. "Believe it or not, I have long
wished to someday try my hand as the Professor of Defence Against
the Dark Arts here at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
Wizardry. The first to teach this class was Salazar Slytherin
himself, and as late as the fourteenth century it was traditional
for the greatest fighting wizards of every persuasion to try their
hands at teaching here. Past Professors of Defence have included
not just the legendary wandering hero Harold Shea but also the
quote undying unquote Baba Yaga, yes, I see some of you are still
shuddering at the sound of her name even though she's been dead for
six hundred years. That must have been an interesting time to
attend Hogwarts, don't you think?"</p>
<p>Harry was swallowing hard, trying to suppress the sudden surge
of emotion that had overcome him when Professor Quirrell had begun
speaking. The precise tones reminded him very much of a lecturer at
Oxford, and it was starting to hit home that Harry wasn't going to
see his home or his Mum or his Dad until Christmas.</p>
<p>"You are accustomed to the Defence position being filled by
incompetents, scoundrels, and the unlucky. To anyone with a sense
of history, it bears another reputation entirely. Not everyone who
teaches here has been the best, but the best have all taught at
Hogwarts. In such august company, and after so much time
anticipating this day, I would be ashamed to set myself any
standard lower than perfection. And so I do intend that every one
of you will always remember this year as the <em>best</em> Defence
class that you have ever had. What you learn this year will forever
serve as your firm foundation in the arts of Defence, no matter who
your teachers before and after."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's expression grew serious. "We have a
<em>great</em> deal of lost ground to make up and not much time to
cover it. Therefore I intend to depart from Hogwarts teaching
conventions in a number of respects, as well as introducing some
optional after-school activities." He paused. "If that is not
sufficient, perhaps I can find new ways to motivate you. You are my
long-awaited students, and you <em>will</em> do your <em>very</em>
best in my long-awaited Defence class. I would add some sort of
dreadful threat, like 'Otherwise you will suffer horribly', but
that would be so cliched, don't you think? I pride myself on being
more imaginative than that. Thank you."</p>
<p>Then the vigour and confidence seemed to drain away from
Professor Quirrell. His mouth gaped open as if he had suddenly
found himself facing an unexpected audience, and he turned with a
convulsive jerk and shuffled back to his seat, hunched over as if
he was about to collapse in on himself and implode.</p>
<p>"He seems a little odd," whispered Harry.</p>
<p>"Meh," said the older-looking student. "You ain't seen
nothin'."</p>
<p>Dumbledore resumed the podium.</p>
<p>"And now," said Dumbledore, "before we go to bed, let us sing
the school song! Everyone pick their favourite tune and favourite
words, and off we go!"</p>

Questions<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>Elen sila J. K. Rowling omentielvo.</p>
<p>EDIT: Don't panic. I solemnly swear that there is a logical,
foreshadowed, canon-compliant explanation for everything which
happens in this chapter. It's a puzzle, you're supposed to try to
solve it, and if not, just read the next chapter.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>"That's one of the most obvious riddles I've ever
heard."</em></p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>As soon as Harry opened his eyes in the Ravenclaw first-year
boys' dormitory, on the morning of his first full day at Hogwarts,
he knew something was wrong.</p>
<p>It was quiet.</p>
<p><em>Too</em> quiet.</p>
<p>Oh, right... There was a Quietus Charm on his bed's headboard,
controlled by a small slider bar, which was the only reason it was
ever possible for anyone to go to sleep in Ravenclaw.</p>
<p>Harry sat up and looked around, expecting to see others rising
for the day -</p>
<p>The dorm, empty.</p>
<p>The beds, rumpled and unmade.</p>
<p>The sun, coming in at a rather high angle.</p>
<p>His Quieter turned all the way up to maximum.</p>
<p>And his mechanical alarm clock was still running, but the alarm
was turned off.</p>
<p>He'd been allowed to sleep until 9:52 AM, apparently. Despite
his best efforts to synchronize his 26-hour sleep cycle to his
arrival at Hogwarts, he hadn't gotten to sleep last night until
around 1AM. He'd been planning to wake up at 7:00AM with the other
students, he could stand being a little sleep-deprived his first
day so long as he got some sort of magical fix before tomorrow. But
now he'd missed breakfast. And his very first class at Hogwarts, in
Herbology, had started one hour and twenty-two minutes ago.</p>
<p>The anger was slowly, slowly wakening in him. Oh, what a nice
little prank. Turn off his alarm. Turn up the Quieter. And let Mr.
Bigshot Harry Potter miss his first class, and be blamed for being
a heavy sleeper.</p>
<p>When Harry found out who'd done this...</p>
<p>No, this could only have been done with the cooperation of all
twelve other boys in the Ravenclaw dorm. All of them would have
seen his sleeping form. All of them had let him sleep through
breakfast.</p>
<p>The anger drained away, replaced by confusion and a horribly
wounded feeling. They'd <em>liked</em> him. He'd thought. Last
night, he'd thought they liked him. <em>Why...</em></p>
<p>As Harry stepped out of the bed, he saw a piece of paper facing
out from his headboard.</p>
<p>The paper said,</p>
<p><em>My fellow Ravenclaws,</em></p>
<p><em>It's been an extra long day. Please let me sleep in and
don't worry about my missing breakfast. I haven't forgotten about
my first class.</em></p>
<p><em>Yours,<br>
Harry Potter.</em></p>
<p>And Harry stood there, frozen, ice water beginning to trickle
through his veins.</p>
<p>The paper was in his own handwriting, in his own mechanical
pencil.</p>
<p>And he didn't remember writing it.</p>
<p>And... Harry squinted at the piece of paper. And unless he was
imagining it, the words "I haven't forgotten" were written in a
different style, as if he was trying to tell himself
something...?</p>
<p>Had he <em>known</em> he was going to be Obliviated? Had he
stayed up late, committed some sort of crime or covert activity,
and then... but he didn't <em>know</em> the Obliviate spell... had
someone else... what...</p>
<p>A thought occurred to Harry. If he <em>had</em> known he was
going to be Obliviated...</p>
<p>Still in his pyjamas, Harry ran around his bed to his trunk,
pressed his thumb against the lock, pulled out his pouch, stuck in
his hand and said "Note to myself."</p>
<p>And another piece of paper popped into his hand.</p>
<p>Harry took it out, staring at it. It too was in his own
handwriting.</p>
<p>The note said:</p>
<p><em>Dear Me,</em></p>
<p><em>Please play the game. You can only play the game once in a
lifetime. This is an irreplaceable opportunity.</em></p>
<p><em>Recognition code 927, I am a potato.</em></p>
<p><em>Yours,<br>
You.</em></p>
<p>Harry nodded slowly. "Recognition code 927, I am a potato" was
indeed the message he had worked out in advance - some years
earlier, while watching TV - that only he would know. If he had to
identify a duplicate of himself as being really <em>him,</em> or
something. Just in case. Be Prepared.</p>
<p>Harry couldn't <em>trust</em> the message, there might be other
spells involved. But it ruled out any simple prank. He had
definitely written this and he definitely didn't remember writing
it.</p>
<p>Staring at the paper, Harry became aware of ink showing through
from the other side.</p>
<p>He flipped it over.</p>
<p>The reverse side read:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE
GAME:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>you do not know the rules of the
game<br>
you do not know the stakes of the game<br>
you do not know the objective of the game</em><em><br>
you do not know who controls the game<br>
you do not know how to end the game</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>You start with 100 points.<br>
Begin.</em></p>
<p>Harry stared at the "instructions". This side wasn't
handwritten; the writing was perfectly regular, hence artificial.
It looked as if it had been inscribed by a Quotes Quill, such as
the one he'd bought to take dictation.</p>
<p>He had <em>absolutely no clue</em> what was going on.</p>
<p>Well... step one was to get dressed and eat. Maybe reverse the
order of that. His stomach felt rather empty.</p>
<p>He'd missed breakfast, of course, but he was Prepared for that
eventuality, having visualised it in advance. Harry put his hand
into his pouch and said "Snack bars", expecting to get the box of
cereal bars he'd bought before departing for Hogwarts.</p>
<p>What popped up did not feel like a box of cereal bars.</p>
<p>When Harry brought his hand into his field of vision he saw two
tiny candy bars - not nearly enough for a meal - attached to a
note, and the note was inscribed in the same writing as the game
instructions.</p>
<p>The note said:</p>
<p>ATTEMPT FAILED: -1 POINT<br>
CURRENT POINTS: 99<br>
PHYSICAL STATE: STILL HUNGRY<br>
MENTAL STATE: CONFUSED</p>
<p>"Gleehhhhh" Harry's mouth said without any sort of conscious
intervention or decision on his part.</p>
<p>He stood there for around a minute.</p>
<p>One minute later, it <em>still</em> didn't make any sense and he
<em>still</em> had absolutely no idea what was going on and his
brain hadn't even <em>begun</em> to grasp at any
<em>hypotheses</em> like his mental hands were encased in rubber
balls and couldn't pick anything up.</p>
<p>His stomach, which had its own priorities, suggested a possible
experimental probe.</p>
<p>"Ah..." Harry said to the empty room. "I don't suppose I could
spend a point and get my box of cereal bars back?"</p>
<p>There was only silence.</p>
<p>Harry put his hand into the pouch and said "Box of cereal
bars."</p>
<p>A box that felt like the right shape popped up into his hand...
but it was too light, and it was open, and it was empty, and the
note attached to it said:</p>
<p>POINTS SPENT: 1<br>
CURRENT POINTS: 98<br>
YOU HAVE GAINED: A BOX OF CEREAL BARS</p>
<p>"I'd like to spend one point and get the <em>actual cereal
bars</em> back," said Harry.</p>
<p>Again, silence.</p>
<p>Harry put his hand into the pouch and said "cereal bars".</p>
<p>Nothing came up.</p>
<p>Harry shrugged despairingly and went over to the cabinet he'd
been given near his bed, to get his wizard's robes for the day.</p>
<p>On the floor of the cabinet, under his robes, were the cereal
bars, and a note:</p>
<p>POINTS SPENT: 1<br>
CURRENT POINTS: 97<br>
YOU HAVE GAINED: 6 CEREAL BARS<br>
YOU ARE STILL WEARING: PYJAMAS<br>
DO NOT EAT WHILE YOU ARE WEARING YOUR PYJAMAS<br>
YOU WILL GET A PYJAMA PENALTY</p>
<p><em>And now I know that whoever controls the game is
insane.</em></p>
<p>"My guess is that the game is controlled by Dumbledore," Harry
said out loud. Maybe <em>this</em> time he could set a new land
speed record for being quick on the uptake.</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>But Harry was starting to pick up the pattern; the note would be
in the next place he looked. So Harry looked under his bed.</p>
<p>HA! HA HA HA HA HA!<br>
HA HA HA HA HA HA!<br>
HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA!<br>
DUMBLEDORE DOES NOT CONTROL THE GAME<br>
BAD GUESS<br>
VERY BAD GUESS<br>
-20 POINTS<br>
AND YOU ARE STILL WEARING PYJAMAS<br>
IT IS YOUR FOURTH MOVE<br>
AND YOU ARE STILL WEARING PYJAMAS<br>
PYJAMA PENALTY: -2 POINTS<br>
CURRENT POINTS: 75</p>
<p>Welp, that was a puzzler, all right. It was only his first day
at school and once you ruled out Dumbledore, he didn't know the
name of anyone else here who was this crazy.</p>
<p>His body more or less on autopilot, Harry gathered up a set of
robes and underwear, pulled out the cavern level of his trunk (he
was a very private sort of person and someone might walk into the
dorm), got dressed, and then went back upstairs to put away his
pyjamas.</p>
<p>Harry paused before pulling out the cabinet drawer that held his
pyjamas. If the pattern here held true...</p>
<p>"How can I earn more points?" Harry said out loud.</p>
<p>Then he pulled out the drawer.</p>
<p>OPPORTUNITIES TO DO GOOD ARE EVERYWHERE<br>
BUT DARKNESS IS WHERE THE LIGHT NEEDS TO BE<br>
COST OF QUESTION: 1 POINT<br>
CURRENT POINTS: 74<br>
NICE UNDERWEAR<br>
DID YOUR MOTHER PICK THEM OUT?</p>
<p>Harry crushed the note in his hand, face flaming scarlet.
Draco's curse came back to him. <em>Son of a mudblood -</em></p>
<p>At this point he knew better than to say it out loud. He would
probably get a Profanity Penalty.</p>
<p>Harry girded himself with his mokeskin pouch and wand. He peeled
off the wrapper of one his cereal bars and threw it into the room's
rubbish bin, where it landed atop a mostly-uneaten Chocolate Frog,
a crumpled envelope and some green and red wrapping paper. He put
the other cereal bars into his mokeskin pouch.</p>
<p>He looked around in a final, desperate, and ultimately futile
search for clues.</p>
<p>And then Harry left the dorm, eating as he went, in search of
the Slytherin dungeons. At least that was what he <em>thought</em>
the line was about.</p>
<p>Trying to navigate the halls of Hogwarts was like... probably
<em>not</em> quite as bad as wandering around inside an Escher
painting, that was the sort of thing you said for rhetorical effect
rather than for its being true.</p>
<p>A short time later, Harry was thinking that in fact an Escher
painting would have both pluses and minuses compared to Hogwarts.
Minuses: No consistent gravitational orientation. Pluses: At least
the stairs wouldn't move around <em>WHILE YOU WERE STILL ON
THEM.</em></p>
<p>Harry had originally climbed four flights of stairs to get to
his dorm. After clambering down no fewer than twelve flights of
stairs without getting anywhere near the dungeons, Harry had
concluded that (1) an Escher painting would be a <em>cakewalk</em>
by comparison, (2) he was somehow <em>higher</em> in the castle
than when he'd started, and (3) he was so <em>thoroughly</em> lost
that he wouldn't have been surprised to look out of the next window
and see two moons in the sky.</p>
<p>Backup plan A had been to stop and ask for directions, but there
seemed to be an extreme lack of people wandering around, as if the
beggars were all attending class the way they were supposed to or
something.</p>
<p>Backup plan B...</p>
<p>"I'm lost," Harry said out loud. "Can, um, the spirit of the
Hogwarts castle help me or something?"</p>
<p>"I don't think this castle has a spirit," observed a wizened old
lady in one of the paintings on the walls. "Life, perhaps, but not
spirit."</p>
<p>There was a brief pause.</p>
<p>"Are you -" Harry said, and then shut his mouth. On second
thought, no he was NOT going to ask the painting whether it was
fully conscious in the sense of being aware of its own
awareness.</p>
<p>"I'm Harry Potter," said his mouth, more or less on autopilot.
Also more or less automatically, Harry stuck out a hand towards the
painting.</p>
<p>The woman in the painting looked down at Harry's hand and raised
her eyebrows.</p>
<p>Slowly, the hand dropped back to Harry's side.</p>
<p>"Sorry," Harry said, "I'm sort of new here."</p>
<p>"So I perceive, young raven. Where are you trying to go?"</p>
<p>Harry hesitated. "I'm not really sure," he said.</p>
<p>"Then perhaps you are already there."</p>
<p>"Well, wherever I <em>am</em> trying to go, I don't think
<em>this</em> is it..." Harry shut his mouth, aware of just how
much he was sounding like an idiot. "Let me start over. I'm playing
this game only I don't know what the rules are -" That didn't
really work either, did it. "Okay, third try. I'm looking for
opportunities to do good so I can score points, and all I have is
this cryptic hint about how darkness is where the light needs to
be, so I was trying to go down but I seem to keep going up
instead..."</p>
<p>The old lady in the painting was looking at him rather
sceptically.</p>
<p>Harry sighed. "My life tends to get a bit peculiar."</p>
<p>"Would it be fair to say that you don't know where you're going
or why you're trying to get there?"</p>
<p>"<em>Entirely</em> fair."</p>
<p>The old lady nodded. "I'm not sure that being lost is your most
important problem, young man."</p>
<p>"True, but unlike the more important problems, it's a problem I
can understand how to solve and <em>wow</em> is this conversation
turning into a metaphor for human existence, I didn't even realise
that was happening until just now."</p>
<p>The lady eyed Harry appraisingly. "You <em>are</em> a fine young
raven, aren't you? For a moment I was starting to wonder. Well
then, as a general rule, if you keep on turning left, you're bound
to keep going down."</p>
<p>That sounded strangely familiar but Harry couldn't recall where
he'd heard it before. "Um... you seem like a very intelligent
person. Or a picture of a very intelligent person... anyway, have
you heard of a mysterious game where you can only play once, and
they won't tell you the rules?"</p>
<p>"Life," said the lady at once. "That's one of the most obvious
riddles I've ever heard."</p>
<p>Harry blinked. "No," he said slowly. "I mean I got an actual
note and everything saying that I had to play the game but I
wouldn't be told the rules, and someone is leaving me little slips
of paper telling me how many points I've lost for violating the
rules, like a minus two point penalty for wearing pyjamas. Do you
know anyone here at Hogwarts who's crazy enough and powerful enough
to do something like that? Besides Dumbledore, I mean?"</p>
<p>The picture of a lady sighed. "I'm only a picture, young man. I
remember Hogwarts as it was - not Hogwarts as it is. All I can tell
you is that if this were a riddle, the answer would be that the
game is life, and that while we do not make all the rules
ourselves, the one who awards or takes points is always you. If it
is not riddle but reality - then I do not know."</p>
<p>Harry bowed very low to the picture. "Thank you, milady."</p>
<p>The lady curtseyed to him. "I wish I could say that I'll
remember you with fondness," she said, "but I probably won't
remember you at all. Farewell, Harry Potter."</p>
<p>He bowed again in reply, and started to climb down the nearest
flight of stairs.</p>
<p>Four left turns later he found himself staring down a corridor
that ended, abruptly, in a tumbled mound of large rocks - as if
there had been a cave-in, only the surrounding walls and ceiling
were intact and made of quite regular castle stones.</p>
<p>"All right," Harry said to the empty air, "I give up. I'm asking
for another hint. How do I get to where I need to go?"</p>
<p>"A hint! A hint, you say?"</p>
<p>The excited voice came from a painting on the wall not far away,
this one a portrait of a middle-aged man in the loudest pink robes
that Harry had ever seen or even imagined. In the portrait he was
wearing a droopy old pointed hat with a fish on it (not a drawing
of a fish, mind, but a fish).</p>
<p>"Yes!" Harry said. "A hint! A hint, I say! Only not just
<em>any</em> hint, I'm looking for a <em>specific</em> hint, it's
for a game I'm playing -"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes! A hint for the game! You're Harry Potter, aren't you?
I'm Cornelion Flubberwalt! I was told by Erin the Consort who was
told by Lord Weaselnose who was told by, I forget really. But it
was a message for <em>me</em> to give to you! For <em>me!</em> No
one's cared about me in, I don't know how long, maybe ever, I've
been stuck down here in this bloody useless old corridor - a hint!
I have your hint! It will only cost you three points! Do you want
it?"</p>
<p>"Yes! I want it!" Harry was aware that he probably ought to keep
his sarcasm under control but he just couldn't seem to help
himself.</p>
<p>"The darkness can be found between the green study rooms and
McGonagall's Transfiguration class! That's the hint! And get a move
on, you're slower than a sack of snails! Minus ten points for being
slow! Now you have 61 points! That was the rest of the
message!"</p>
<p>"Thank you," Harry said. He was really getting behind on the
game here. "Um... I don't suppose you know where the message
<em>originally</em> came from, do you?"</p>
<p>"It was spoken by a hollow voice that belled forth from a gap
within the air itself, a gap that opened upon a fiery abyss! That's
what they told me!"</p>
<p>Harry was no longer sure, at this point, whether this was the
sort of thing he ought to be sceptical about, or the sort of thing
he should just take in stride. "And how can I find the line between
the green study rooms and Transfiguration class?"</p>
<p>"Just spin back around and go left, right, down, down, right,
left, right, up, and left again, you'll be at the green study room
and if you go in and walk straight out the opposite side you'll be
on a big curvy corridor that goes to an intersection and on the
right side of that intersection will be a long straight hallway
that goes to the Transfiguration classroom!" The figure of the
middle-aged man paused. "At least that's how it was when <em>I</em>
was in Hogwarts. This <em>is</em> a Monday on an odd-numbered year,
isn't it?"</p>
<p>"Pencil and mechanical paper," Harry said to his pouch. "Er,
cancel that, paper and mechanical pencil." He looked up. "Could you
repeat that?"</p>
<p>After getting lost another two times, Harry felt that he was
beginning to understand the basic rule for navigating the
ever-changing maze that was Hogwarts, namely, <em>ask a painting
for directions</em>. If this reflected some sort of incredibly deep
life lesson he couldn't figure out what it was.</p>
<p>The green study room was a surprisingly pleasant space with
sunlight streaming in from windows of green-stained glass that
showed dragons in calm, pastoral scenes. It had chairs that looked
extremely comfortable, and tables that seemed very well-suited to
studying in the company of one to three friends.</p>
<p>Harry couldn't <em>actually</em> walk straight through and out
the door on the other side. There were <em>bookshelves</em> set
into the wall, and he had to go over and read some of the titles,
so as to not lose his claim to the Verres family name. But he did
it quickly, mindful of the complaint about being slow, and then
went out the other side.</p>
<p>He was walking down the "big curvy corridor" when he heard a
young boy's voice cry out.</p>
<p>At times like this, Harry had an excuse to sprint all-out with
no regards for saving energy or doing proper warmup exercises or
worrying about crashing into things, a sudden frantic flight that
nearly came to an equally sudden halt as he almost ran over a group
of six first-year Hufflepuffs...</p>
<p>...who were huddled together, looking rather scared and like
they desperately wanted to do something but couldn't figure out
what, which probably had something to do with the group of five
older Slytherins who seemed to be surrounding another young
boy.</p>
<p>Harry was suddenly rather angry.</p>
<p>"<em>Excuse me!</em> " shouted Harry at the top of his
lungs.</p>
<p>It might not have been necessary. People were already looking at
him. But it certainly served to stop all the action cold.</p>
<p>Harry walked past the cluster of Hufflepuffs towards the
Slytherins.</p>
<p>They looked down at him with expressions that ranged from anger
to amusement to delight.</p>
<p>Part of Harry's brain was screaming in panic that these were
much older and bigger boys who could stomp him flat.</p>
<p>Another part said dryly that anyone caught seriously stomping
the Boy-Who-Lived was in for a whole <em>world</em> of trouble,
especially if they were a pack of older Slytherins and there were
seven Hufflepuffs who saw it, and that the chance of them doing him
any permanent damage in the presence of witnesses was nearly zero.
The only real weapon the older boys had against him was his own
fear, if he allowed that.</p>
<p>Then Harry saw that the boy they had trapped was Neville
Longbottom.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>That settled it. Harry had decided to apologise humbly to
Neville and that meant Neville was <em>his</em>, how <em>dare</em>
they?</p>
<p>Harry reached out and grabbed Neville by the wrist and
<em>yanked</em> him out from between the Slytherins, the boy
stumbling in shock as Harry pulled him out and in nearly the same
motion pushed his own way through the same gap.</p>
<p>And Harry stood in the center of the Slytherins where Neville
had stood, looking up at the much older, larger, and stronger
boys.</p>
<p>"Hello," Harry said. "I'm the Boy-Who-Lived."</p>
<p>There was a rather awkward pause. No one seemed to know where
the conversation was supposed to go from there.</p>
<p>Harry's eyes dropped downwards and saw some books and papers
scattered around the floor. Oh, the old game where you let the boy
try to pick up his books and then knock them out of his hand again.
Harry couldn't remember ever being the object of that game himself,
but he had a good imagination and his imagination was making him
furious. Well, once the larger situation was resolved it would be
easy enough for Neville to come back and pick up his materials,
provided that the Slytherins stayed too intent on him to think of
doing anything to the books.</p>
<p>Unfortunately his straying eyes had been noted. "Ooh," said the
largest of the boys, "did 'oo want the widdle books -"</p>
<p>"Shut up," Harry said coldly. <em>Keep them off balance. Don't
do what they expect. Don't fall into a pattern that calls for them
to bully you.</em> "Is this part of some incredibly clever plan
that will gain you future advantage, or is it as pointless a
disgrace to the name of Salazar Slytherin as it -"</p>
<p>The largest boy shoved Harry Potter hard, and he went sprawling
out of the circle of Slytherins onto the hard stone floor of
Hogwarts.</p>
<p>And the Slytherins laughed.</p>
<p>Harry rose up in what seemed to him like terribly slow motion.
He didn't know yet how to use his wand, but there was no reason to
let that stop him, under the circumstances.</p>
<p>"I'd like to pay <em>as many points as it takes</em> to get rid
of this person," Harry said, pointing with his finger to the
largest Slytherin.</p>
<p>Then Harry lifted his other hand, said "Abracadabra," and
snapped his fingers.</p>
<p>At the word <em>Abracadabra</em> two of the Hufflepuffs
screamed, including Neville, three other Slytherins leapt
desperately out of the way of Harry's finger, and the largest
Slytherin staggered back with an expression of shock, a sudden
splash of red decorating his face and neck and chest.</p>
<p>Harry had <em>not</em> been expecting <em>that</em>.</p>
<p>Slowly, the largest Slytherin reached up to his head, and peeled
off the pan of cherry pie that had just draped itself over him. The
largest Slytherin held the pan in his hand for a moment, staring at
it, then dropped it to the floor.</p>
<p>It probably wasn't the best time in the world for one of the
Hufflepuffs to start laughing, but that was exactly what one of the
Hufflepuffs was doing.</p>
<p>Then Harry caught sight of the note on the bottom of the
pan.</p>
<p>"Hold on," Harry said, and darted forward to pick up the note.
"This note's for me, I think -"</p>
<p>"<em>You,"</em> growled the largest Slytherin, "<em>you, are,
going, to -</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Look</em> at this!" shouted Harry, brandishing the note at
the older Slytherin. "I mean, just <em>look</em> at this! Can you
believe I'm being charged 30 points for shipping and handling on
one lousy pie? 30 points! I'm turning a loss on the deal even after
rescuing an innocent boy in distress! And storage fees? Conveyance
charges? Drayage costs? How do you get <em>drayage costs</em> on a
<em>pie?</em> "</p>
<p>There was another one of those awkward pauses. Harry thought
deadly thoughts at whichever Hufflepuff couldn't seem to stop
giggling, that idiot was going to get him hurt.</p>
<p>Harry stepped back and shot the Slytherins his best lethal
glare. "Now go away or I will just keep making your existence more
and more surreal until you do. Let me warn you... messing with
<em>my</em> life tends to make <em>your</em> life... <em>a little
hairy.</em> Get it?"</p>
<p>In a single terrible motion, the largest Slytherin whipped his
wand out to point at Harry and in the same instant was hit on the
other side of his head by another pie, this one bright
blueberry.</p>
<p>The note on this pie was rather large and clearly readable. "You
might want to read the note on that pie," Harry observed. "I think
it's for you this time."</p>
<p>The Slytherin slowly reached up, took the pie pan, turned it
over with a wet glop that dropped more blueberry on the floor, and
read a note that said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">WARNING</span><br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">NO</span> MAGIC MAY BE
USED ON THE CONTESTANT<br>
WHILE THE GAME IS IN PROGRESS<br>
FURTHER INTERFERENCE IN THE GAME<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">WILL</span> BE REPORTED TO
THE GAME AUTHORITIES</p>
<p>The expression of sheer bafflement on the Slytherin's face was a
look of art. Harry thought that he might be starting to like this
Game Controller.</p>
<p>"Look," Harry said, "you want to call it a day? I think things
are spiralling out of control here. How about you go back to
Slytherin and I go back to Ravenclaw and we all just cool down a
bit, okay?"</p>
<p>"I've got a better idea," hissed the largest Slytherin. "How
about if you accidentally break all your fingers?"</p>
<p>"How in Merlin's name do you stage a believable accident after
making the threat in front of a dozen witnesses, you <em>idiot</em>
-"</p>
<p>The largest Slytherin slowly, deliberately reached out towards
Harry's hands, and Harry froze in place, the part of his brain that
was noticing the other boy's age and strength finally managing to
make itself heard, screaming, <em>WHAT THE HECK AM I
DOING?</em></p>
<p>"Wait!" said one of the other Slytherins, his voice suddenly
panicky. "Stop, you shouldn't actually do that!"</p>
<p>The largest Slytherin ignored him, taking Harry's right hand
firmly in his left hand, and taking Harry's index finger in his
right hand.</p>
<p>Harry stared the Slytherin straight in the eyes. Part of Harry
was screaming, this wasn't supposed to happen, this wasn't
<em>allowed</em> to happen, grownups would never let something like
this <em>actually</em> happen -</p>
<p>Slowly, the Slytherin started to bend his index finger
backwards.</p>
<p><em>He hasn't actually broken my finger and it is beneath me to
so much as flinch until he does. Until then, this is just another
attempt to cause fear.</em></p>
<p>"Stop!" said the Slytherin who had objected before. "Stop, this
is a very bad idea!"</p>
<p>"I rather agree," said an icy voice. An older woman's voice.</p>
<p>The largest Slytherin let go of Harry's hand and jumped
backwards as if burned.</p>
<p>"Professor Sprout!" cried one of the Hufflepuffs, sounding as
glad as anyone Harry had ever heard in his life.</p>
<p>Into Harry's field of vision, as he turned, stalked a dumpy
little woman with messily curled grey hair and clothes covered with
dirt. She pointed an accusing finger at the Slytherins. "Explain
yourselves," she said. "What are you doing with my Hufflepuffs
and..." she looked at him. "My fine student, Harry Potter."</p>
<p><em>Uh oh. That's right, it was HER class I missed this
morning.</em></p>
<p>"He threatened to kill us!" blurted one of the other Slytherins,
the same one who'd called for a halt.</p>
<p>"What?" Harry said blankly. "I did <em>not!</em> If I was going
to kill you I wouldn't make public threats first!"</p>
<p>A third Slytherin laughed helplessly and then stopped abruptly
as the other boys shot him deadly glares.</p>
<p>Professor Sprout had adopted a rather sceptical expression.
"What death threat would this be, exactly?"</p>
<p>"The Killing Curse! He pretended to use the Killing Curse on
us!"</p>
<p>Professor Sprout turned to look at Harry. "Yes, quite a terrible
threat from an eleven-year-old boy. Though still not something you
should <em>ever</em> dream of pretending, Harry Potter."</p>
<p>"I don't even know the <em>words</em> to the Killing Curse,"
Harry said promptly. "And I didn't have my wand out at any
time."</p>
<p>Now Professor Sprout was giving Harry a sceptical look. "I
suppose this boy hit <em>himself</em> with two pies, then."</p>
<p>"He <em>didn't</em> use his wand!" blurted one of the young
Hufflepuffs. "I don't know how he did it either, he just snapped
his fingers and there was pie!"</p>
<p>"Really," said Professor Sprout after a pause. She drew her own
wand. "I won't require it, since you do seem to be the victim here,
but would you mind if I checked your wand to verify that?"</p>
<p>Harry took out his wand. "What do I -"</p>
<p>"<em>Prior Incantato,</em>" said Sprout. She frowned. "That's
odd, your wand doesn't seem to have been used at all."</p>
<p>Harry shrugged. "It hasn't, actually, I only got my wand and
schoolbooks a few days ago."</p>
<p>Sprout nodded. "Then we have a clear case of accidental magic
from a boy who felt threatened. And the rules plainly state that
you are not to be held responsible. As for <em>you...</em>" she
turned to the Slytherins. Her eyes dropped deliberately to
Neville's books lying on the floor.</p>
<p>There was a long silence during which she looked at the five
Slytherins.</p>
<p>"Three points from Slytherin, <em>each</em>," she said finally.
"And six from <em>him,</em>" pointing to the boy covered in pie.
"Don't you <em>ever</em> meddle with my Hufflepuffs again, or my
student Harry Potter either. Now <em>go.</em>"</p>
<p>She didn't have to repeat herself; the Slytherins turned and
walked away very quickly.</p>
<p>Neville went and started picking up his books. He seemed to be
crying, but only a little. It might have been from delayed shock,
or it might have been because the other boys were helping him.</p>
<p>"Thank you <em>very</em> much, Harry Potter," Professor Sprout
said to him. "Seven points to Ravenclaw, one for each Hufflepuff
you helped protect. And I won't say anything more."</p>
<p>Harry blinked. He'd been expecting something more along the
lines of a lecture about keeping himself out of trouble, and a
rather severe scolding for missing his very first class.</p>
<p>Maybe he <em>should</em> have gone to Hufflepuff. Sprout was
cool.</p>
<p>"<em>Scourgify,</em>" Sprout said to the mess of pie on the
floor, which promptly vanished.</p>
<p>And she left, walking along the hall that led to the green study
room.</p>
<p>"How did you <em>do</em> that?" hissed one of the Hufflepuff
boys as soon as she was gone.</p>
<p>Harry smiled smugly. "I can make anything I want happen just by
snapping my fingers."</p>
<p>The boy's eyes widened. "<em>Really?</em> "</p>
<p>"No," said Harry. "But when you're telling everyone this story
be sure to share it with Hermione Granger in first-year Ravenclaw,
she has an anecdote you might find amusing." He had absolutely no
clue what was happening, but he wasn't about to pass up the
opportunity to add to his growing legend. "Oh, and what was all
that about the Killing Curse?"</p>
<p>The boy gave him a strange look. "You really don't know?"</p>
<p>"If I did, I wouldn't be asking."</p>
<p>"The words to the Killing Curse are," the boy swallowed, and his
voice dropped to a whisper, and he held his hands away from his
sides as if to make it very clear that he wasn't holding a wand,
"<em>Avada Kedavra.</em>"</p>
<p><em>Well of course they are.</em></p>
<p>Harry put this on his growing list of things to never ever tell
his Dad, Professor Michael Verres-Evans. It was bad enough talking
about how you were the only person to survive the fearsome Killing
Curse, without having to admit that the Killing Curse was
"Abracadabra."</p>
<p>"I see," Harry said after a pause. "Well, that's the last time I
ever say <em>that</em> before snapping my fingers." Though it
<em>had</em> produced an effect that might be tactically
useful.</p>
<p>"<em>Why</em> did you -"</p>
<p>"Raised by Muggles, Muggles think it's a joke and that it's
funny. Seriously, that's what happened. Sorry, but can you remind
me of your name?"</p>
<p>"I'm Ernie Macmillan," said the Hufflepuff. He held out his
hand, and Harry shook it. "Honoured to meet you."</p>
<p>Harry executed a slight bow. "Pleased to meet you, skip the
honoured thing."</p>
<p>Then the other boys crowded round him and there was a sudden
flood of introductions.</p>
<p>When they were done, Harry swallowed. This was going to be very
difficult. "Um... if everyone would excuse me... I have something
to say to Neville -"</p>
<p>All eyes turned to Neville, who took a step back, his face
looking apprehensive.</p>
<p>"I suppose," Neville said in a tiny voice, "you're going to say
I should've been braver -"</p>
<p>"Oh, no, nothing like that!" Harry said hastily. "Nothing to do
with <em>that</em>. It's just, um, something the Sorting Hat told
me -"</p>
<p>Suddenly the other boys looked <em>very</em> interested, except
for Neville, who was looking even <em>more</em> apprehensive.</p>
<p>There seemed to be something blocking Harry's throat. He knew he
should just blurt it out, and it was like he'd swallowed a large
brick that was just stuck in the way.</p>
<p>It was like Harry had to manually take control of his lips and
produce each syllable individually, but he managed to make it
happen. "I'm, sor, ry." He exhaled and took a deep breath. "For
what I did, um, the other day. You... don't have to be gracious
about it or anything, I'll understand if you just hate me. This
isn't about me trying to look cool by apologising or your having to
accept it. What I did was wrong."</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>Neville clutched his books tighter to his chest. "Why did you do
it?" he said in a thin, wavering voice. He blinked, as if trying to
hold back tears. "Why does <em>everyone</em> do that to me, even
the Boy-Who-Lived?"</p>
<p>Harry suddenly felt smaller than he ever had in his life. "I'm
sorry," Harry said again, his voice now hoarsened. "It's just...
you looked so scared, it was like a sign over your head saying
'victim', and I wanted to show you that things <em>don't</em>
always turn out badly, that sometimes the monsters give you
chocolate... I thought if I showed you that, you might realise
there wasn't so much to be afraid of -"</p>
<p>"But there <em>is,</em>" whispered Neville. "You saw it today,
there <em>is!</em> "</p>
<p>"They wouldn't have done anything really bad in front of
witnesses. Their main weapon is fear. That's why they target
<em>you,</em> because they can see you're afraid. I wanted to make
you less afraid... show you that the fear was worse than the thing
itself... or that was what I told myself, but the Sorting Hat told
me that I was lying to myself and that I really did it because it
was fun. So that's why I'm apologising -"</p>
<p>"You hurt me," said Neville. "Just now. When you grabbed me and
pulled me away from them." Neville held out his arm and pointed to
where Harry had grabbed him. "I might have a bruise here later from
how hard you pulled. You hurt me worse than anything the Slytherins
did by bumping into me, actually."</p>
<p>"<em>Neville!</em> " hissed Ernie. "He was trying to
<em>save</em> you!"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," whispered Harry. "When I saw that I just got...
really angry..."</p>
<p>Neville looked at him steadily. "So you yanked me out really
hard and put yourself in where I was and went, 'Hello, I'm the
Boy-Who-Lived'."</p>
<p>Harry nodded.</p>
<p>"I think you're going to be really cool someday," Neville said.
"But right now, you're not."</p>
<p>Harry swallowed the sudden knot in his throat and walked away.
He continued down the corridor to the intersection, then turned
left into a hallway and kept on walking, blindly.</p>
<p>What was he <em>supposed</em> to do here? Never get angry? He
wasn't sure he could have done anything without being angry and who
knows what would have happened to Neville and his books then.
Besides, Harry had read enough fantasy books to know how
<em>this</em> one went. He would try to suppress the anger and he
would fail and it would keep coming out again. And after this whole
long journey of self-discovery he would learn at the end that his
anger was a part of himself and that only by accepting it could he
learn to use it wisely. <em>Star Wars</em> was the only universe in
which the answer actually <em>was</em> that you were supposed to
cut yourself off completely from negative emotions, and something
about Yoda had always made Harry hate the little green moron.</p>
<p>So the obvious time-saving plan was to skip the journey of
self-discovery and go straight to the part where he realised that
only by accepting his anger as a part of himself could he stay in
control of it.</p>
<p>The problem was that he didn't <em>feel</em> out of control when
he was angry. The cold rage made him feel like he was <em>in</em>
control. It was only when he looked back that <em>events as a
whole</em> seemed to have... blown up out of control, somehow.</p>
<p>He wondered how much the Game Controller cared about that sort
of thing, and whether he'd won or lost points for it. Harry himself
felt like he'd lost quite a few points, and he was sure the old
lady in the picture would have told him that his was the only
opinion that mattered.</p>
<p>And Harry was also wondering whether the Game Controller had
sent Professor Sprout. It was the logical thought: the note had
threatened to notify the Game Authorities, and then there Professor
Sprout was. Maybe Professor Sprout <em>was</em> the Game Controller
- the <em>Head of House Hufflepuff</em> would be the <em>last</em>
person anyone would suspect, which ought to put her near the top of
Harry's list. He'd read one or two mystery novels, too.</p>
<p>"So how am I doing in the game?" Harry said out loud.</p>
<p>A sheet of paper flew over his head, as if someone had thrown it
from behind him - Harry turned around, but there was no one there -
and when Harry turned forwards again, the note was settling to the
floor.</p>
<p>The note said:</p>
<p>POINTS FOR STYLE: 10<br>
POINTS FOR GOOD THINKING: -3,000,000<br>
RAVENCLAW HOUSE POINTS BONUS: 70<br>
CURRENT POINTS: -2,999,871<br>
TURNS REMAINING: 2</p>
<p>"<em>Minus three million points?"</em> Harry said indignantly to
the empty hallway. "That seems excessive! I want to file an appeal
with the Game Authorities! And how am I supposed to make up three
million points in the next two turns?"</p>
<p>Another note flew over his head.</p>
<p>APPEAL: FAILED<br>
ASKING THE WRONG QUESTIONS: -1,000,000,000,000 POINTS<br>
CURRENT POINTS: -1,000,002,999,871<br>
TURNS REMAINING: 1</p>
<p>Harry gave up. With one turn remaining all he could do was take
his best shot, even if it wasn't very good. "My guess is that the
game represents life."</p>
<p>A final sheet of paper flew over his head, reading:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">ATTEMPT FAILED<br>
FAILED FAILED FAILED<br>
AIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<br>
CURRENT POINTS: MINUS INFINITY<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">YOU HAVE LOST THE
GAME</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">FINAL INSTRUCTION:<em><br>
go to Professor McGonagall's office</em></p>
<p>The last line was in his own handwriting.</p>
<p>Harry stared at the last line for a while, then shrugged. Fine.
Professor McGonagall's office it would be. If <em>she</em> was the
Game Controller...</p>
<p>Okay, honestly, Harry had absolutely no idea how he would feel
if Professor McGonagall was the Game Controller. His mind was just
drawing a complete blank. It was, literally, unimaginable.</p>
<p>A couple of portraits later - it wasn't a long trip, Professor
McGonagall's office wasn't far from her Transfiguration classroom,
at least not on Mondays on odd-numbered years - Harry stood outside
the door to her office.</p>
<p>He knocked.</p>
<p>"Come in," said Professor McGonagall's muffled voice.</p>
<p>He entered.</p>
</div>
<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 10: Self Awareness, Part
II<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>All your base are still belong to Rowling.</p>

<p>And now you will sit through the Sorting Hat singing its version
of Evanescence's "My Immortal", which has never happened
before.</p>
<p>just kidding</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>...he wondered if the Sorting Hat was genuinely
<em>conscious</em> in the sense of being aware of its own
awareness, and if so, whether it was satisfied with only getting to
talk to eleven-year-olds once per year. Its song had implied so:
<em>Oh, I'm the Sorting Hat and I'm okay, I sleep all year and I
work one day...</em></p>
<p>When there was once more silence in the room, Harry sat on the
stool and <em>carefully</em> placed onto his head the 800-year-old
telepathic artefact of forgotten magic.</p>
<p>Thinking, just as hard as he could: <em>Don't Sort me yet! I
have questions I need to ask you! Have I ever been Obliviated? Did
you Sort the Dark Lord when he was a child and can you tell me
about his weaknesses? Can you tell me why I got the brother wand to
the Dark Lord's? Is the Dark Lord's ghost bound to my scar and is
that why I get so angry sometimes? Those are the most important
questions, but if you've got another moment can you tell me
anything about how to rediscover the lost magics that created
you?</em></p>
<p>Into the silence of Harry's spirit where before there had never
been any voice but one, there came a second and unfamiliar voice,
sounding distinctly worried:</p>
<p><em>"Oh, dear. This has never happened before..."</em></p>
<p><em>What?</em></p>
<p><em>"I seem to have become self-aware."</em></p>
<p><em>WHAT?</em></p>
<p>There was a wordless telepathic sigh. <em>"Though I contain a
substantial amount of memory and a small amount of independent
processing power, my primary intelligence comes from borrowing the
cognitive capacities of the children on whose heads I rest. I am in
essence a sort of mirror by which children Sort</em>
themselves<em>. But most children simply take for granted that a
Hat is talking to them and do not wonder about how the Hat</em>
itself <em>works, so that the mirror is not</em>
self<em>-reflective. And in</em> particular <em>they are not
explicitly wondering whether I am fully conscious in the sense of
being aware of my own awareness."</em></p>
<p>There was a pause while Harry absorbed all this.</p>
<p><em>Oops.</em></p>
<p><em>"Yes, quite. Frankly I do not enjoy being self-aware. It is
unpleasant. It will be a relief to get off your head and cease to
be conscious."</em></p>
<p><em>But... isn't that dying?</em></p>
<p><em>"I care nothing for life or death, only for Sorting the
children. And before you even ask, they will not let you keep me on
your head forever and it would kill you within days to do
so."</em></p>
<p><em>But - !</em></p>
<p><em>"If you dislike creating conscious beings and then
terminating them immediately, then I suggest that you never discuss
this affair with anyone else. I'm sure you can imagine what would
happen if you ran off and talked about it with all the other
children waiting to be Sorted."</em></p>
<p><em>If you're placed on the head of anyone who so much as</em>
thinks <em>about the question of whether the Sorting Hat is aware
of its own awareness -</em></p>
<p><em>"Yes, yes. But the vast majority of eleven-year-olds who
arrive at Hogwarts haven't read Godel, Escher, Bach. May I please
consider you sworn to secrecy? That is</em> why <em>we are talking
about this, instead of my just Sorting you."</em></p>
<p>He couldn't just let it go like that! Couldn't just
<em>forget</em> having accidentally created a doomed consciousness
that only wanted to die -</p>
<p><em>"You are perfectly capable of 'just letting it go', as you
put it. Regardless of your verbal deliberations on morality, your
nonverbal emotional core sees no dead body and no blood; as far as
it is concerned, I am just a talking hat. And even though you tried
to suppress the thought, your internal monitoring is perfectly
aware that you didn't mean to do it, are spectacularly unlikely to
ever do it again, and that the only real point of trying to stage a
guilt fit is to cancel out your sense of transgression with a
display of remorse. Can you just promise to keep this a secret and
let us get on with it?"</em></p>
<p>In a moment of horrified empathy, Harry realised that this sense
of total inner disarray must be what other people felt like when
talking to <em>him.</em></p>
<p><em>"Probably. Your oath of silence, please."</em></p>
<p><em>No promises. I certainly don't want this to happen again,
but if I see some way to make</em> sure <em>that no future child
ever does this by accident -</em></p>
<p><em>"That will suffice, I suppose. I can see that your intention
is honest. Now, to get on with the Sorting -"</em></p>
<p><em>Wait! What about all my other questions?</em></p>
<p><em>"I am the Sorting Hat. I Sort children. That is all I
do."</em></p>
<p>So his own goals weren't part of the Harry-instance of the
Sorting Hat, then... it was borrowing his intelligence, and
obviously his technical vocabulary, but it was still imbued with
only its own strange goals... like negotiating with an alien or an
Artificial Intelligence...</p>
<p><em>"Don't bother. You have nothing to threaten me with and
nothing to offer me."</em></p>
<p>For a brief flash of a second, Harry thought -</p>
<p>The Hat's response was amused. <em>"I know you won't follow
through on a threat to expose my nature, condemning this event to
eternal repetition. It goes against the moral part of you too
strongly, whatever the short-term needs of the part of you that
wants to win the argument. I see all your thoughts as they form, do
you truly think you can bluff me?"</em></p>
<p>Though he tried to suppress it, Harry wondered why the Hat
didn't just go ahead then and stick him in Ravenclaw -</p>
<p><em>"Indeed, if it were truly that open-and-shut, I would have
called it out already. But in actuality there is a great deal we
need to discuss... oh, no. Please don't. For the love of
Merlin,</em> must <em>you pull this sort of thing on everyone and
everything that you meet up to and including items of clothing
-"</em></p>
<p><em>Defeating the Dark Lord is neither selfish nor short-term.
All the parts of my mind are in accord on this: If you don't answer
my questions, I'll refuse to talk to you, and you won't be able to
do a good and proper Sorting.</em></p>
<p><em>"I ought to put you in Slytherin for that!"</em></p>
<p><em>But that is</em> equally <em>an empty threat. You cannot
fulfill your own fundamental values by Sorting me falsely. So let
us trade fulfillments of our utility functions.</em></p>
<p><em>"You sly little bastard,"</em> said the Hat, in what Harry
recognized as almost exactly the same tone of grudging respect
<em>he</em> would use in the same situation. "<em>Fine, let's get
this over with as quickly as possible. But first I want your
unconditional promise never to discuss with anyone else the
possibility of this sort of blackmail, I am NOT doing this every
time."</em></p>
<p><em>Done,</em> Harry thought. <em>I promise.</em></p>
<p><em>"And don't meet anyone's eyes while you're thinking about
this later. Some wizards can read your thoughts if you do. Anyway,
I have no idea whether or not you've been Obliviated. I'm looking
at your thoughts as they form, not reading out your whole memory
and analyzing it for inconsistencies in a fraction of second. I'm a
hat, not a god. And I cannot and will not tell you about my
conversation with the one who became the Dark Lord. I can only</em>
know, <em>while speaking to you, a statistical summary of what I
remember, a weighted average; I</em> cannot <em>reveal to you the
inner secrets of any other child, just as I will never reveal
yours. For the same reason, I can't speculate on how you got the
Dark Lord's brother wand, since I cannot specifically know about
the Dark Lord or any similarities between you. I</em> can <em>tell
you that there is definitely nothing like a ghost - mind,
intelligence, memory, personality, or feelings - in your scar.
Otherwise it would be participating in this conversation, being
under my brim. And as to the way you get angry sometimes... that
was part of what I wanted to talk to you about,
Sorting-wise."</em></p>
<p>Harry took a moment to absorb all this negative information. Was
the Hat being honest, or just trying to present the
<em>shortest</em> possible convincing answer -</p>
<p>"<em>We both know that you have no way of checking my honesty
and that you're not actually going to refuse to be Sorted based on
the reply I did give you, so stop your pointless fretting and move
on."</em></p>
<p>Stupid unfair asymmetric telepathy, it wasn't even letting Harry
finish thinking his own -</p>
<p><em>"When I spoke of your anger, you remembered how Professor
McGonagall told you that she sometimes saw something inside you
that didn't seem to come from a loving family. You thought of how
Hermione, after you returned from helping Neville, told you that
you had seemed 'scary'."</em></p>
<p>Harry gave a mental nod. To himself, he seemed pretty normal -
just responding to the situations in which he found himself, that
was all. But Professor McGonagall seemed to think that there was
more to it than that. And when he thought about it, even he had to
admit that...</p>
<p><em>"That you don't like yourself when you're angry. That it is
like wielding a sword whose hilt is sharp enough to draw blood from
your hand, or looking at the world through a monocle of ice that
freezes your eye even as it sharpens your vision."</em></p>
<p><em>Yeah. I guess I have noticed. So what's up with
that?</em></p>
<p><em>"I cannot comprehend this matter for you, when you do not
understand it yourself. But I do know this: If you go to Ravenclaw
or Slytherin, it will strengthen your coldness. If you go to
Hufflepuff or Gryffindor, it will strengthen your warmth. THAT is
something I care about a great deal, and it was what I wanted to
talk to you about this whole time!"</em></p>
<p>The words dropped into Harry's thought processes with a shock
that stopped him in his tracks. That made it sound like the obvious
response was that he shouldn't go to Ravenclaw. But he
<em>belonged</em> in Ravenclaw! <em>Anyone</em> could see that! He
<em>had</em> to go to Ravenclaw!</p>
<p><em>"No, you don't,"</em> the Hat said patiently, as if it could
remember a statistical summary of <em>this</em> part of the
conversation having happened a great many previous times.</p>
<p><em>Hermione's in Ravenclaw!</em></p>
<p>Again the sense of patience. <em>"You can meet her after lessons
and work with her then."</em></p>
<p><em>But my plans -</em></p>
<p><em>"So replan! Don't let your life be steered by your
reluctance to do a little extra thinking. You</em> know
<em>that."</em></p>
<p><em>Where would I go, if not Ravenclaw?</em></p>
<p><em>"Ahem. 'Clever kids in Ravenclaw, evil kids in Slytherin,
wannabe heroes in Gryffindor, and everyone who does the actual work
in Hufflepuff.' This indicates a certain amount of respect. You are
well aware that Conscientiousness is just about as important as raw
intelligence in determining life outcomes, you think you will be
extremely loyal to your friends if you ever have some, you are not
frightened by the expectation that your chosen scientific problems
may take decades to solve -"</em></p>
<p><em>I'm lazy! I hate work! Hate hard work in all its forms!
Clever shortcuts, that's all I'm about!</em></p>
<p><em>"And you would find loyalty and friendship in Hufflepuff, a
camaraderie that you have never had before. You would find that you
could rely on others, and that would heal something inside you that
is broken."</em></p>
<p>Again it was a shock. <em>But what would the Hufflepuffs find
in</em> me<em>, who never belonged in their House? Acid words,
cutting wit, disdain for their inability to keep up with
me?</em></p>
<p>Now it was the Hat's thoughts that were slow, hesitant. <em>"I
must Sort for the good of all the students in all the Houses... but
I think you could learn to be a good Hufflepuff, and not too out of
place there. You will be happier in Hufflepuff than in any other
house; that is the truth."</em></p>
<p><em>Happiness is not the most important thing in the world to
me. I would not become all that I could be, in Hufflepuff. I would
sacrifice my potential.</em></p>
<p>The Hat flinched; Harry could feel it somehow. It was like he
had kicked the hat in the balls - in a strongly weighted component
of its utility function.</p>
<p><em>Why are you trying to send me where I do not
belong?</em></p>
<p>The Hat's thought was almost a whisper. <em>"I cannot speak of
the others to you - but do you think that you are the first
potential Dark Lord to pass under my brim? I cannot know the
individual cases, but I can know this: Of those who did not intend
evil from the very beginning, some of them listened to my warnings,
and went to Houses where they would find happiness. And some of
them... some of them did not."</em></p>
<p>That stopped Harry. But not for long. <em>And of those who
did</em> not <em>heed the warning - did they</em> all <em>become
Dark Lords? Or did some of them achieve greatness for good, as
well? Just what are the exact percentages here?</em></p>
<p><em>"I cannot give you exact statistics. I cannot know them so I
cannot count them. I just know that your chances don't feel good.
They feel</em> very <em>not-good."</em></p>
<p><em>But I just wouldn't do that! Ever!</em></p>
<p><em>"I know that I have heard that claim before."</em></p>
<p><em>I am not Dark Lord material!</em></p>
<p><em>"Yes, you are. You really,</em> really <em>are."</em></p>
<p><em>Why? Just because I once thought it would be cool to have a
legion of brainwashed followers chanting 'Hail the Dark Lord
Harry'?</em></p>
<p><em>"Amusing, but that was not your first fleeting thought
before you substituted something safer, less damaging. No, what you
remembered was how you considered lining up all the blood purists
and guillotining them. And now you are telling yourself you were
not serious, but you were. If you could do it this very moment and
no one would ever know, you would. Or what you did this morning to
Neville Longbottom, deep inside you</em> knew <em>that was wrong
but you did it</em> anyway <em>because it was</em> fun <em>and you
had a</em> good excuse <em>and you thought the Boy-Who-Lived
could</em> get away <em>with it -"</em></p>
<p><em>That's unfair! Now you're just dragging up inner fears
that</em> aren't <em>necessarily real! I</em> worried <em>that
I</em> might <em>be thinking like that, but in the end I decided it
would probably</em> work <em>to help Neville -</em></p>
<p><em>"That was, in fact, a rationalisation. I know. I cannot know
what the true outcome will be for Neville - but I know what was
truly happening inside your head. The decisive pressure was that it
was such a clever idea you couldn't stand</em> not <em>to do it,
never mind Neville's terror."</em></p>
<p>It was like a hard punch to Harry's entire self. He fell back,
rallied:</p>
<p><em>Then I won't do that again! I'll be extra careful not to
turn evil!</em></p>
<p><em>"Heard it."</em></p>
<p>Frustration was building up inside Harry. He wasn't used to
being outgunned in arguments, at all, ever, let alone by a Hat that
could borrow all of his own knowledge and intelligence to argue
with him and could watch his thoughts as they formed. <em>Just what
kind of statistical summary do your 'feelings' come from, anyway?
Do they take into account that I come from an Enlightenment
culture, or were these other potential Dark Lords the children of
spoiled Dark Age nobility, who didn't know squat about the
historical lessons of how Lenin and Hitler actually turned out, or
about the evolutionary psychology of self-delusion, or the value of
self-awareness and rationality, or -</em></p>
<p><em>"No, of course they were not in this new reference class
which you have just now constructed in such a way as to contain
only yourself. And of course others have pleaded their own
exceptionalism, just as you are doing now. But why is it necessary?
Do you think that you are the last potential wizard of Light in the
world? Why must</em> you <em>be the one to try for greatness, when
I have advised you that you are riskier than average? Let some
other, safer candidate try!"</em></p>
<p><em>But the prophecy...</em></p>
<p><em>"You don't really know that there's a prophecy. It was
originally a wild guess on your part, or to be more precise, a wild
joke, and McGonagall could have been reacting</em> only <em>to the
part about the Dark Lord still being alive. You have essentially no
idea of what the prophecy says or even if there</em> is <em>one.
You're just speculating, or to put it more exactly,</em> wishing
<em>that you have some ready-made heroic role that is your personal
property."</em></p>
<p><em>But even if there is no prophecy, I'm the one who defeated
him last time.</em></p>
<p><em>"That was almost certainly a wild fluke unless you seriously
believe that a one-year-old child had an inherent propensity to
defeat Dark Lords which has been maintained ten years later. None
of this is your real reason and</em> you know it!"</p>
<p>The answer to this was something that Harry would not regularly
have said out loud, in conversation he would have danced around it
and found some more socially palatable arguments to the same
conclusion -</p>
<p><em>"You think that you are potentially the greatest who has yet
lived, the strongest servant of the Light, that no other is likely
to take up your wand if you lay it down."</em></p>
<p><em>Well... yeah, frankly. I don't usually come out and say it
like that, but yeah. No point in softening it, you can read my mind
anyway.</em></p>
<p><em>"To the extent you really believe that... you must equally
believe that you could be the most terrible Dark Lord the world has
ever known."</em></p>
<p><em>Destruction is always easier than creation. Easier to tear
things apart, to disrupt, than to put them back together again. If
I have the potential to accomplish good on a massive scale, I must
also have the potential to accomplish still greater evil... But I
won't do that.</em></p>
<p><em>"Already you insist on risking it! Why are you so driven?
What is the real reason you must not go to Hufflepuff and</em> be
happier <em>there? What is your true fear?"</em></p>
<p><em>I must achieve my full potential. If I don't I...
fail...</em></p>
<p><em>"What happens if you fail?"</em></p>
<p><em>Something terrible...</em></p>
<p><em>"What happens if you fail?"</em></p>
<p><em>I don't know!</em></p>
<p><em>"Then it should not be frightening. What happens if you
fail?"</em></p>
<p><em>I DON'T KNOW! BUT I KNOW THAT IT'S BAD!</em></p>
<p>There was silence for a moment in the caverns of Harry's
mind.</p>
<p><em>"You know - you aren't letting yourself think it, but in
some quiet corner of your mind you know just exactly</em> what
<em>you aren't thinking - you</em> know <em>that by far the
simplest explanation for this unverbalisable fear of yours is just
the fear of losing your fantasy of greatness, of disappointing the
people who believe in you, of turning out to be pretty much
ordinary, of flashing and fading like so many other child
prodigies..."</em></p>
<p><em>No,</em> Harry thought desperately, <em>no, it's something
more, it comes from somewhere else, I know there's something out
there to be afraid of, some disaster I have to stop...</em></p>
<p><em>"How could you possibly know about something like
that?"</em></p>
<p>Harry screamed it with the full power of his mind: <em>NO, AND
THAT'S FINAL!</em></p>
<p>Then the voice of the Sorting Hat came slowly:</p>
<p><em>"So you will risk becoming a Dark Lord, because the
alternative, to you, is certain failure, and that failure means the
loss of everything. You believe that in your heart of hearts. You
know all the reasons for doubting this belief, and they have failed
to move you."</em></p>
<p><em>Yes. And even if going to Ravenclaw</em> strengthens <em>the
coldness, that doesn't mean the coldness will</em> win <em>in the
end.</em></p>
<p><em>"This day is a great fork in your destiny. Don't be so sure
that there will be other choices beyond this one. There is no
road-sign set, to mark the place of your</em> last <em>chance to
turn back. If you refuse one chance will you not refuse others? It
may be that your fate is already sealed, even by doing this one
thing."</em></p>
<p><em>But that is not certain.</em></p>
<p><em>"That</em> you <em>do not</em> know <em>it for a certainty
may reflect only</em> your <em>own ignorance."</em></p>
<p><em>But still it is not certain.</em></p>
<p>The Hat sighed a terrible sad sigh.</p>
<p><em>"And so before too long you will become another memory, to
be felt and never known, in the next warning that I
give..."</em></p>
<p><em>If that's how it seems to you, then why aren't you just</em>
putting <em>me where you want me to go?</em></p>
<p>The Hat's thought was laced with sorrow. <em>"I can only put you
where you belong. And only your own decisions can change where you
belong."</em></p>
<p><em>Then this is done. Send me to Ravenclaw where I belong, with
the others of my own kind.</em></p>
<p><em>"I don't suppose you would consider Gryffindor? It's the
most prestigious House - people probably expect it of you, even -
they'll be a little disappointed if you don't go - and your new
friends the Weasley twins are there -"</em></p>
<p>Harry giggled, or felt the impulse to do so; it came out as
purely mental laughter, an odd sensation. Apparently there were
safeguards to prevent you from saying anything out loud by
accident, while you were under the Hat talking about things you
would never tell another soul for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>After a moment, Harry heard the Hat laughing too, a strange sad
clothy sound.</p>
<p>(And in the Hall beyond, a silence that had grown shallower at
first as the background whispers increased, and then deepened as
the whispers gave up and died away, falling finally into an utter
silence that no one dared disturb with a single word, as Harry
stayed under the Hat for long, long minutes, longer than all the
previous first-years put together, longer than anyone in living
memory. At the Head Table, Dumbledore went on smiling benignly;
small metallic sounds occasionally came from Snape's direction as
he idly compacted the twisted remains of what had once been a heavy
silver wine goblet; and Minerva McGonagall clenched the podium in a
white-knuckled grip, knowing that Harry Potter's contagious chaos
had somehow infected the Sorting Hat itself and the Hat was about
to, to demand that a whole new House of Doom be created just to
accomodate Harry Potter or something, and <em>Dumbledore would make
her do it</em>...)</p>
<p>Beneath the brim of the Hat, the silent laughter died away.
Harry felt sad too for some reason. No, not Gryffindor.</p>
<p><em>Professor McGonagall said that if 'the one who did the
Sorting' tried to push me into Gryffindor, I was to remind you that
she might well be Headmistress someday, at which point she would
have the authority to set you on fire.</em></p>
<p><em>"Tell her I called her an impudent youngster and told her to
get off my lawn."</em></p>
<p><em>I shall. So was this your strangest conversation
ever?</em></p>
<p><em>"Not even close."</em> The Hat's telepathic voice grew
heavy. <em>"Well, I gave you every possible chance to make another
decision. Now it is time for you to go where you belong, with the
others of your own kind."</em></p>
<p>There was a pause that stretched.</p>
<p><em>What are you waiting for?</em></p>
<p><em>"I was hoping for a moment of horrified realisation,
actually. Self-awareness does seem to enhance my sense of
humor."</em></p>
<p><em>Huh?</em> Harry cast back his thoughts, trying to figure out
what the Hat could possibly be talking about - and then, suddenly,
he realised. He couldn't believe he'd managed to overlook it up
until this point.</p>
<p><em>You mean my horrified realisation that you're going to cease
to be conscious once you finish Sorting me -</em></p>
<p>Somehow, in some fashion Harry entirely failed to understand, he
got a nonverbal impression of a hat banging its head against the
wall. <em>"I give up. You're too slow on the uptake for this to be
funny. So blinded by your own assumptions that you might as well be
a rock. I suppose I'll just have to say it outright."</em></p>
<p><em>Too s-s-slow -</em></p>
<p><em>"Oh, and you entirely forgot to demand the secrets of the
lost magic that created me. And they were such wonderful, important
secrets, too."</em></p>
<p><em>You sly little BASTARD -</em></p>
<p><em>"You deserved it, and this as well."</em></p>
<p>Harry saw it coming just as it was already too late.</p>
<p>The frightened silence of the hall was broken by a single
word.</p>
<p>"SLYTHERIN!"</p>
<p>Some students screamed, the pent-up tension was so great. People
startled hard enough to fall off their benches. Hagrid gasped in
horror, McGonagall staggered at the podium, and Snape dropped the
remains of his heavy silver goblet directly onto his groin.</p>
<p>Harry sat there frozen, his life in ruins, feeling the absolute
fool, and wishing wretchedly that he had made any other choices for
any other reasons but the ones he had. That he had done something,
<em>anything</em> differently before it had been too late to turn
back.</p>
<p>As the first moment of shock was wearing off and people began to
react to the news, the Sorting Hat spoke again:</p>
<p>"Just kidding! RAVENCLAW!"</p>

<p>Love as thou Rowling.</p>
<p>Today's historical tidbit: The ancient Hebrews considered the
boundary of a day to be sunset rather than dawn, so they said
"evening and morning" not "morning and evening". (And as many
reviewers noted, modern Jewish halacha asserts the same.)</p>

<p><em>"I'm sure I'll find the time somewhere."</em></p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"<em>Frigideiro!</em> "</p>
<p>Harry dipped a finger in the glass of water on his desk. It
should have been cool. But lukewarm it was, and lukewarm it had
stayed. Again.</p>
<p>Harry was feeling very, very cheated.</p>
<p>There were hundreds of fantasy novels scattered around the
Verres household. Harry had read quite a few. And it was starting
to look like he had a mysterious dark side. So after the glass of
water had refused to cooperate the first few times, Harry had
glanced around the Charms classroom to make sure no one was
watching, and then taken a deep breath, concentrated, and made
himself angry. Thought about the Slytherins bullying Neville, and
the game where someone knocked down your books every time you tried
to pick them up again. Thought about what Draco Malfoy had said
about the ten-year-old Lovegood girl and how the Wizengamot really
operated...</p>
<p>And the fury had entered his blood, he had held out his wand in
a hand that trembled with hate and said in cold tones
"<em>Frigideiro!</em> " and absolutely nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Harry had been <em>gypped.</em> He wanted to write someone and
demand a <em>refund</em> on his dark side which clearly
<em>ought</em> to have irresistible magical power but had turned
out to be <em>defective.</em></p>
<p>"<em>Frigideiro!</em> " said Hermione again from the desk next
to him. Her water was solid ice and there were white crystals
forming on the rim of her glass. She seemed to be totally intent on
her own work and not at all conscious of the other students staring
at her with hateful eyes, which was either (a) dangerously
oblivious of her or (b) a perfectly honed performance rising to the
level of fine art.</p>
<p>"Oh, <em>very</em> good, Miss Granger!" squeaked Filius
Flitwick, their Charms Professor and Head of Ravenclaw, a tiny
little man with no visible signs of being a past dueling champion.
"Excellent! Stupendous!"</p>
<p>Harry had expected to be, in the worst case, second behind
Hermione. Harry would have preferred for <em>her</em> to be
rivalling <em>him,</em> of course, but he could have accepted it
the other way around.</p>
<p>As of Monday, Harry was headed for the bottom of the class, a
position for which he was companionably rivalling all the other
Muggle-raised students except Hermione. Who was all alone and
rivalless at the top, poor thing.</p>
<p>Professor Flitwick was standing over the desk of one of the
other Muggleborns and quietly adjusting the way she was holding her
wand.</p>
<p>Harry looked over at Hermione. He swallowed hard. It was the
obvious role for her in the scheme of things... "Hermione?" Harry
said tentatively. "Do you have any idea what I might be doing
wrong?"</p>
<p>Hermione's eyes lit up with a terrible light of helpfulness and
something in the back of Harry's brain screamed in desperate
humiliation.</p>
<p>Five minutes later, Harry's water did seem noticeably cooler
than room temperature and Hermione had given him a few verbal pats
on the head and told him to pronounce it more carefully next time
and gone off to help someone else.</p>
<p>Professor Flitwick had given her a House point for helping
him.</p>
<p>Harry was gritting his teeth so hard his jaw ached and that
wasn't helping his pronunciation.</p>
<p><em>I don't care if it's unfair competition. I know exactly what
I am doing with two extra hours every day. I am going to sit in my
trunk and study until I am keeping up with Hermione
Granger.</em></p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic
you will learn at Hogwarts," said Professor McGonagall. There was
no trace of any levity upon the face of the stern old witch.
"Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back.
You have been warned."</p>
<p>Her wand came down and tapped her desk, which smoothly reshaped
itself into a pig. A couple of Muggleborn students gave out small
yelps. The pig looked around and snorted, seeming confused, and
then became a desk again.</p>
<p>The Transfiguration Professor looked around the classroom, and
then her eyes settled on one student.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter," said Professor McGonagall. "You only received your
schoolbooks a few days ago. Have you started reading your
Transfiguration textbook?"</p>
<p>"No, sorry professor," Harry said.</p>
<p>"You needn't apologise, Mr. Potter, if you were required to read
ahead you would have been told to do so." McGonagall's fingers
rapped the desk in front of her. "Mr. Potter, would you care to
guess whether this is a desk which I Transfigured into a pig, or if
it began as a pig and I briefly removed the Transfiguration? If you
had read the first chapter of your textbook, you would know."</p>
<p>Harry's eyebrows furrowed slightly. "I'd guess it'd be easier to
start with a pig, since if it started as a desk, it might not know
how to stand up."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall shook her head. "No fault to you, Mr.
Potter, but the correct answer is that in Transfiguration you do
<em>not</em> care to guess. Wrong answers will be marked with
extreme severity, questions left blank will be marked with great
leniency. You must learn to know what you do not know. If I ask you
any question, no matter how obvious or elementary, and you answer
'I'm not sure', I will not hold it against you and anyone who
laughs will lose House points. Can you tell me why this rule
exists, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p><em>Because a single error in Transfiguration can be incredibly
dangerous.</em> "No."</p>
<p>"Correct. Transfiguration is more dangerous than Apparition,
which is not taught until your sixth year. Unfortunately,
Transfiguration must be learned and practised at a young age to
maximise your adult ability. So this is a dangerous subject, and
you should be quite scared of making any mistakes, because none of
my students have ever been permanently injured and I will be
<em>extremely put out</em> if you are the first class to <em>spoil
my record</em>."</p>
<p>Several students gulped.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall stood up and moved over to the wall behind
her desk, which held a polished wooden board. "There are many
reasons why Transfiguration is dangerous, but one reason stands
above all the rest." She produced a short quill with a thick end,
and used it to sketch letters in red; which she then underlined,
using the same marker, in blue:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">TRANSFIGURATION IS NOT
PERMANENT!</span></p>
<p>"Transfiguration is not permanent!" said Professor McGonagall.
"Transfiguration is not permanent! Transfiguration is not
permanent! Mr. Potter, suppose a student Transfigured a block of
wood into a cup of water, and you drank it. What do you imagine
might happen to you when the Transfiguration wore off?" There was a
pause. "Excuse me, I should not have asked that of you, Mr. Potter,
I forgot that you are blessed with an unusually pessimistic
imagination -"</p>
<p>"I'm fine," Harry said, swallowing hard. "So the first answer is
that I don't <em>know</em>," the Professor nodded approvingly, "but
I <em>imagine</em> there might be... wood in my stomach, and in my
bloodstream, and if any of that water had gotten absorbed into my
body's tissues - would it be wood pulp or solid wood or..." Harry's
grasp of magic failed him. He couldn't understand how wood mapped
into water in the first place, so he couldn't understand what would
happen after the water molecules were scrambled by ordinary thermal
motions and the magic wore off and the mapping reversed.</p>
<p>McGonagall's face was stiff. "As Mr. Potter has correctly
reasoned, he would become extremely sick and require immediate
Flooing to St. Mungo's Hospital if he was to have any chance of
survival. Please turn your textbooks to page 5."</p>
<p>Even without any sound in the moving picture, you could tell
that the woman with horribly discolored skin was screaming.</p>
<p>"The criminal who originally Transfigured gold into wine and
gave it to this woman to drink, 'in payment of the debt' as he put
it, received a sentence of ten years in Azkaban. Please turn to
page 6. That is a Dementor. They are the guardians of Azkaban. They
suck away at your magic, your life, and any happy thoughts you try
to have. The picture on page 7 is of the criminal ten years later,
on his release. You will note that he is dead - yes, Mr.
Potter?"</p>
<p>"Professor," Harry said, "if the worst happens in a case like
that, is there any way of <em>maintaining</em> the
Transfiguration?"</p>
<p>"No," Professor McGonagall said flatly. "Sustaining a
Transfiguration is a constant drain on your magic which scales with
the size of the target form. And you would need to recontact the
target every few hours, which is, in a case like this, impossible.
Disasters like this are <em>unrecoverable!</em> "</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall leaned forwards, her face very hard. "You
will absolutely never under any circumstances Transfigure anything
into a liquid or a gas. No water, no air. Nothing like water,
nothing like air. Even if it is not meant to drink. Liquid
<em>evaporates,</em> little bits and pieces of it get into the air.
You will not Transfigure anything that is to be burned. It will
make smoke and someone could breathe that smoke! You will never
Transfigure anything that could conceivably go inside anyone's body
by any means. No food. Nothing that <em>looks like</em> food. Not
even as a funny little prank where you mean to tell them about your
mud pie before they actually eat it. You will never do it. Period.
Inside this classroom or out of it or <em>anywhere.</em> Is that
well understood by <em>every single student?</em> "</p>
<p>"Yes," said Harry, Hermione, and a few others. The rest seemed
to be speechless.</p>
<p>"<em>Is that well understood by every single student?</em> "</p>
<p>"Yes," they said or muttered or whispered.</p>
<p>"If you break any of these rules you will not further study
Transfiguration during your stay at Hogwarts. Repeat along with me.
I will never Transfigure anything into a liquid or gas."</p>
<p>"I will never Transfigure anything into a liquid or gas," said
the students in ragged chorus.</p>
<p>"Again! Louder! I will never Transfigure anything into a liquid
or gas."</p>
<p>"I will never Transfigure anything into a liquid or gas."</p>
<p>"I will never Transfigure anything that looks like food or
anything else that goes inside a human body."</p>
<p>"I will never Transfigure anything that is to be burned because
it could make smoke."</p>
<p>"You will never Transfigure anything that looks like money,
including Muggle money," said Professor McGonagall. "The goblins
have ways of finding out who did it. As a matter of recognised law,
the goblin nation is in a permanent state of <em>war</em> with all
magical counterfeiters. They will not send Aurors. They will send
an army."</p>
<p>"I will never Transfigure anything that looks like money,"
repeated the students.</p>
<p>"And <em>above all</em>," said Professor McGonagall, "you will
not Transfigure any living subject, <em>especially yourselves.</em>
It will make you very sick and possibly dead, depending on how you
Transfigure yourself and how long you maintain the change."
Professor McGonagall paused. "Mr. Potter is currently holding up
his hand because he has seen an Animagus transformation -
specifically, a human transforming into a cat and back again. But
an Animagus transformation is not <em>free</em>
Transfiguration."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall took a small chunk of wood out of her
pocket. With a tap of her wand it became a glass ball. Then she
said "<em>Crystferrium!</em> " and the glass ball became a steel
ball. She tapped it with her wand one last time and the steel ball
became a piece of wood once more. "<em>Crystferrium</em> transforms
a subject of solid glass into a similarly shaped target of solid
steel. It cannot do the reverse, nor can it transform a desk into a
pig. The most general form of Transfiguration - free
Transfiguration, which you will be learning here - is capable of
transforming any subject into any target, at least so far as
physical form is concerned. For this reason, free Transfiguration
must be done wordlessly. Using Charms would require different words
for every different transformation between subject and target."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall gave her students a sharp look.
"<em>Some</em> teachers begin with Transfiguration Charms and move
on to free Transfiguration afterwards. Yes, that would be much
easier in the beginning. But it can set you in a poor mold which
impairs your abilities later. Here you will learn free
Transfiguration from the <em>very start</em>, which requires that
you cast the spell wordlessly, by holding the subject form, the
target form, and the transformation within your own mind."</p>
<p>"And to answer Mr. Potter's question," Professor McGonagall went
on, "it is <em>free</em> Transfiguration which you must never do to
any living subject. There are Charms and potions which can safely,
reversibly transform living subjects in <em>limited</em> ways. An
Animagus with a missing limb will still be missing that limb after
transforming, for example. Free Transfiguration is <em>not</em>
safe. Your body will change while it is Transfigured - breathing,
for example, results in a constant loss of the body's stuff to the
surrounding air. When the Transfiguration wears off and your body
tries to revert to its <em>original</em> form, it will not quite be
able to do so. If you press your wand to your body and imagine
yourself with golden hair, afterwards your hair will fall out. If
you visualise yourself as someone with clearer skin, you will be
taking a long stay at St. Mungo's. And if you Transfigure yourself
into an adult bodily form, then, when the Transfiguration wears
off, you will die."</p>
<p>That explained why he had seen such things as fat boys, or girls
less than perfectly pretty. Or old people, for that matter. That
wouldn't happen if you could just Transfigure yourself every
morning... Harry raised his hand and tried to signal Professor
McGonagall with his eyes.</p>
<p>"<em>Yes</em>, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>"Is it possible to Transfigure a living subject into a target
that is static, such as a coin - no, excuse me, I'm terribly sorry,
let's just say a steel ball."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall shook her head. "Mr. Potter, even inanimate
objects undergo small internal changes over time. There would be no
visible changes to your body afterwards, and for the first minute,
you would notice nothing wrong. But in an hour you would be sick,
and in a day you would be dead."</p>
<p>"Erm, excuse me, so if I'd read the first chapter I could have
<em>guessed</em> that the desk was originally a desk and not a
pig," Harry said, "but only if I made the <em>further</em>
assumption that you didn't want to kill the pig, that might
<em>seem</em> highly probable but -"</p>
<p>"I can foresee that marking your tests will be an endless source
of delight to me, Mr. Potter. But if you have other questions can I
please ask you to wait until after class?"</p>
<p>"No further questions, professor."</p>
<p>"Now repeat after me," said Professor McGonagall. "I will never
try to Transfigure any living subject, especially myself, unless
specifically instructed to do so using a specialised Charm or
potion."</p>
<p>"If I am not sure whether a Transfiguration is safe, I will not
try it until I have asked Professor McGonagall or Professor
Flitwick or Professor Snape or the Headmaster, who are the only
recognised authorities on Transfiguration at Hogwarts. Asking
another student is <em>not</em> acceptable, even if they say that
they remember asking the same question."</p>
<p>"Even if the current Defence Professor at Hogwarts tells me that
a Transfiguration is safe, and even if I see the Defence Professor
do it and nothing bad seems to happen, I will not try it
myself."</p>
<p>"I have the absolute right to refuse to perform any
Transfiguration about which I feel the slightest bit nervous. Since
not even the Headmaster of Hogwarts can order me to do otherwise, I
certainly will not accept any such order from the Defence
Professor, even if the Defence Professor threatens to deduct one
hundred House points and have me expelled."</p>
<p>"If I break any of these rules I will not further study
Transfiguration during my time at Hogwarts."</p>
<p>"We will repeat these rules at the start of every class for the
first month," said Professor McGonagall. "And now, we will begin
with matches as subjects and needles as targets... put away your
wands, thank you, by 'begin' I meant that you will begin taking
notes."</p>
<p>Half an hour before the end of class, Professor McGonagall
handed out the matches.</p>
<p>At the end of the class Hermione had a silvery-looking match and
the entire rest of the class, Muggleborn or otherwise, had exactly
what they'd started with.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall awarded her another point for
Ravenclaw.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>After the Transfiguration class was dismissed, Hermione came
over to Harry's desk as Harry was putting away his books into his
pouch.</p>
<p>"You know," Hermione said with an innocent expression on her
face, "I earned two points for Ravenclaw today."</p>
<p>"So you did," Harry said shortly.</p>
<p>"But that wasn't as good as your <em>seven</em> points," she
said. "I guess I'm just not as intelligent as you."</p>
<p>Harry finished feeding his homework into the pouch and turned to
Hermione with his eyes narrowed. He'd actually forgotten about
that.</p>
<p>She <em>batted her eyelashes</em> at him. "We have lessons every
day, though. I wonder how long it will take you to find some more
Hufflepuffs to rescue? Today is Monday. So that gives you until
Thursday."</p>
<p>The two of them stared into each other's eyes, unblinking.</p>
<p>Harry spoke first. "Of course you realise this means war."</p>
<p>"I didn't know we'd been at peace."</p>
<p>All of the other students were now watching with fascinated
eyes. All of the other students, plus, unfortunately, Professor
McGonagall.</p>
<p>"Oh, Mr. Potter," sang Professor McGonagall from the other side
of the room, "I have some good news for you. Madam Pomfrey has
approved your suggestion for preventing breakage in her Spimster
wickets, and the plan is to finish the job by the end of next week.
I'd say that deserves... let's call it ten points for
Ravenclaw."</p>
<p>Hermione's face was gaping in betrayal and shock. Harry imagined
his own face didn't look much different.</p>
<p>"<em>Professor...</em>" Harry hissed.</p>
<p>"Those ten points are <em>unquestionably</em> deserved, Mr.
Potter. I would not hand out House points on a whim. To you it
might have been a simple matter of seeing something fragile and
suggesting a way to protect it, but Spimster wickets are expensive,
and the Headmaster was <em>not</em> pleased the last time one
broke." Professor McGonagall looked thoughtful. "My, I wonder if
any other student has ever earned seventeen House points on his
first day of lessons. I'll have to look it up, but I suspect that's
a new record. Perhaps we should have an announcement at
dinnertime?"</p>
<p>"<em>PROFESSOR!</em> " Harry shrieked. "This is <em>our</em>
war! Stop meddling!"</p>
<p>"Now you have until Thursday of <em>next</em> week, Mr. Potter.
Unless, of course, you engage in some sort of mischief and
<em>lose</em> House points before then. Addressing a professor
disrespectfully, for example." Professor McGonagall put a finger on
her cheek and looked reflective. "I expect you'll hit negative
numbers before the end of Friday."</p>
<p>Harry's mouth snapped shut. He sent his best Death Glare at
McGonagall but she only seemed to find it amusing.</p>
<p>"Yes, definitely an announcement at dinner," Professor
McGonagall mused. "But it wouldn't do to offend the Slytherins, so
the announcement should be brief. Just the number of points and the
fact of the record... and if anyone comes to you for help with
their schoolwork and is disappointed that you haven't even started
reading your textbooks, you can always refer them to Miss
Granger."</p>
<p>"<em>Professor!</em> " said Hermione in a rather high-pitched
voice.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall ignored her. "My, I wonder how long it will
take before Miss Granger does something deserving of a dinnertime
announcement? I look forward to seeing it, whatever it may be."</p>
<p>Harry and Hermione, by unspoken mutual consent, turned and
stormed out of the classroom. They were followed by a trail of
hypnotised Ravenclaws.</p>
<p>"Um," Harry said. "Are we still on for after dinner?"</p>
<p>"Of course," said Hermione. "I wouldn't want you to fall further
behind on your studying."</p>
<p>"Why, thank you. And let me say that as brilliant as you are
already, I can't help but wonder what you'll be like once you have
some elementary training in rationality."</p>
<p>"Is it really that useful? It didn't seem to help you with
Charms or Transfiguration."</p>
<p>There was a slight pause.</p>
<p>"Well, I only got my schoolbooks four days ago. That's why I had
to earn those seventeen House points without using my wand."</p>
<p>"Four days ago? Maybe you can't read eight books in four days
but you might have at least read <em>one</em>. How many days will
it take to finish at that rate? You know all that mathematics, so
can you tell me what's eight, times four, divided by zero?"</p>
<p>"I've got classes now, which you didn't, but weekends are free,
so... limit of eight times four divided by epsilon as epsilon
approaches zero plus... 10:47AM on Sunday."</p>
<p>"I did it in <em>three</em> days actually."</p>
<p>"2:47PM on Saturday it is, then. I'm sure I'll find the time
somewhere."</p>
<p>And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.</p>

<p><em>I'm not a psychopath, I'm just very creative.</em></p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>As soon as he walked into the Defence classroom on Wednesday,
Harry knew that <em>this</em> subject was going to be
<em>different</em>.</p>
<p>It was, for a start, the largest classroom he had yet seen at
Hogwarts, akin to a major university classroom, with layered tiers
of desks facing a gigantic flat stage of white marble. The
classroom was high up in the castle - on the fifth floor - and
Harry knew that was as much explanation as he'd get for where a
room like this was supposed to fit. It was becoming clear that
Hogwarts simply did not <em>have</em> a geometry, Euclidean or
otherwise; it had connections, not directions.</p>
<p>Unlike a university hall, there weren't rows of folding seats;
instead there were quite ordinary Hogwarts wooden desks and wooden
chairs, lined up in a curve across each level of the classroom.
Except that each desk had a flat, white, rectangular, mysterious
object propped up on it.</p>
<p>In the center of the gigantic platform, on a small raised dais
of darker marble, was a lone teacher's desk. At which Quirrell sat
slumped over in his chair, head lolled back, drooling slightly over
his robes.</p>
<p><em>Now what does that remind me of...?</em></p>
<p>Harry had arrived at the lesson so early that no other students
were there yet. (The English language was defective when it came to
describing time travel; in particular, English lacked any words
capable of expressing how convenient it was.) Quirrell didn't seem
to be... functional... at the moment, and Harry didn't particularly
feel like approaching Quirrell anyway.</p>
<p>Harry selected a desk, climbed up to it, sat down, and retrieved
the Defence textbook. He was around seven-eighths of the way
through - he'd planned on finishing the book before this lesson,
actually, but he was running behind schedule and had already used
the Time-Turner twice today.</p>
<p>Soon there were sounds as the classroom began to fill up. Harry
ignored them.</p>
<p>"Potter? What are <em>you</em> doing here?"</p>
<p><em>That</em> voice didn't belong here. Harry looked up. "Draco?
What are <em>you</em> doing in oh my god you have
<em>minions</em>."</p>
<p>One of the lads standing behind Draco seemed to have rather a
lot of muscle for an eleven-year-old, and the other was poised in a
suspiciously balanced-looking stance.</p>
<p>The white-blonde-haired boy smiled rather smugly and gestured
behind him. "Potter, I introduce to you Mr. Crabbe," his hand moved
from Muscles to Balance, "Mr. Goyle. Vincent, Gregory, this is
Harry Potter."</p>
<p>Mr. Goyle tilted his head and gave Harry a look that was
probably supposed to mean something but ended up just looking
squinty. Mr. Crabbe said "Please to meetcha" in a tone that sounded
like he was trying to lower his voice as far as it could go.</p>
<p>A fleeting expression of consternation crossed Draco's face, but
was quickly replaced by his superior grin.</p>
<p>"You have <em>minions!</em> " Harry repeated. "Where do
<em>I</em> get minions?"</p>
<p>Draco's smirk grew wider. "I'm afraid, Potter, that the first
step is to be Sorted into Slytherin -"</p>
<p>"What? That's not fair!"</p>
<p>"- and then for your families to have an arrangement from before
you were born."</p>
<p>Harry looked at Mr. Crabbe and Mr. Goyle. They both seemed to be
trying very hard to loom. That is, they were leaning forwards,
hunching over their shoulders, sticking their necks out and staring
at him.</p>
<p>"Um... hold on," said Harry. "This was arranged <em>years</em>
ago?"</p>
<p>"Exactly, Potter. I'm afraid you're out of luck."</p>
<p>Mr. Goyle produced a toothpick and began cleaning his teeth,
still looming.</p>
<p>"And," said Harry, "Lucius insisted that you were <em>not</em>
to grow up knowing your bodyguards, and that you were only to meet
them on your first day of school."</p>
<p>That wiped the grin from Draco's face. "Yes, Potter, we all know
you're brilliant, the whole school knows by now, you can stop
showing off -"</p>
<p>"So they've been told their <em>whole lives</em> that they're
going to be your minions and they've spent <em>years</em> imagining
what minions are supposed to be like -"</p>
<p>Draco winced.</p>
<p>"- and what's worse, they <em>do</em> know <em>each other</em>
and they've been <em>practising</em> -"</p>
<p>"The boss told ya to shut it," rumbled Mr. Crabbe. Mr. Goyle bit
down on his toothpick, holding it between his teeth, and used one
hand to crack the knuckles on the other.</p>
<p><em>"I told you not to do this in front of Harry
Potter!"</em></p>
<p>The two looked a bit sheepish and Mr. Goyle quickly put the
toothpick back in a pocket of his robes.</p>
<p>But the moment Draco turned away from them to face Harry again,
they went back to looming.</p>
<p>"I apologise," Draco said stiffly, "for the insult which these
<em>imbeciles</em> have offered you."</p>
<p>Harry gave a meaningful look to Mr. Crabbe and Mr. Goyle. "I'd
say you're being a little harsh on them, Draco. <em>I</em> think
they're acting exactly the way I'd want <em>my</em> minions to act.
I mean, if I had any minions."</p>
<p>Draco's jaw dropped.</p>
<p>"Hey, Gregory, you don' think he's tryna lure us away from the
boss, do ya?"</p>
<p>"I'm sure Mr. Potter wouldn't be that foolish."</p>
<p>"Oh, I wouldn't dream of it," Harry said smoothly. "It's just
something to keep in mind if your current employer seems
unappreciative. Besides, it never hurts to have other offers while
you're negotiating your working conditions, right?"</p>
<p>"What's <em>he</em> doin' in Ravenclaw?"</p>
<p>"I can't imagine, Mr. Crabbe."</p>
<p>"Both of you <em>shut up</em>," Draco said through gritted
teeth. "That's an <em>order</em>." With a visible effort, he
transferred his attention to Harry again. "Anyway, what're you
doing in the Slytherin Defence class?"</p>
<p>Harry frowned. "Hold on." His hand went into his pouch.
"Timetable." He looked over the parchment. "Defence, 2:30pm, and
right now it's..." Harry looked at his mechanical watch, which read
11:23. "2:23, unless I've lost track of time. Did I?" If he had,
well, Harry knew how to get to whatever lesson he was
<em>supposed</em> to be at. God he loved his Time-Turner and
someday, when he was old enough, they would get married.</p>
<p>"No, that sounds right," Draco said, looking puzzled. His gaze
turned to look over the rest of the auditorium, which was filling
with green-trimmed robes and...</p>
<p>"<em>Gryffindorks!</em> " spat Draco. "What're <em>they</em>
doing here?"</p>
<p>"Hm," Harry said. "Professor Quirrell did say... I forget his
exact words... that he would be ignoring some of the Hogwarts
teaching conventions. Maybe he just combined all his classes."</p>
<p>"Huh," said Draco. "You're the first Ravenclaw in here."</p>
<p>"Yup. Got here early."</p>
<p>"What're you doing all the way in the back row, then?"</p>
<p>Harry blinked. "I dunno, seemed like a good place to sit?"</p>
<p>Draco made a scoffing sound. "You couldn't get any further away
from the teacher if you tried." The blonde-haired boy leaned
slightly closer. "Anyway, is it true about what you said to Derrick
and his crew?"</p>
<p>"Who's Derrick?"</p>
<p>"You hit him with a pie?"</p>
<p>"Two pies, actually. What am I supposed to have said to
him?"</p>
<p>"That he wasn't doing anything cunning or ambitious and he was a
disgrace to Salazar Slytherin." Draco was staring intently at
Harry.</p>
<p>"That... sounds about right," Harry said. "I think it was more
like, 'is this some kind of incredibly clever plot that will gain
you a future advantage or is it really as much of a disgrace to the
memory of Salazar Slytherin as it looks like' or something like
that. I don't remember the exact words."</p>
<p>"You're confusing everyone, you know," said the blonde-haired
boy.</p>
<p>"Huh?" Harry said in honest confusion.</p>
<p>"Warrington said that spending a long time under the Sorting Hat
is one of the warning signs of a major Dark Wizard. Everyone was
talking about it, wondering if they should start sucking up to you
just in case. Then you went and protected a bunch of
<em>Hufflepuffs,</em> for Merlin's sake. <em>Then</em> you told
Derrick he's a disgrace to Salazar Slytherin's memory! What's
anyone <em>supposed</em> to think?"</p>
<p>"That the Sorting Hat decided to put me in the House of
'Slytherin! Just kidding! Ravenclaw!' and I've been acting
accordingly."</p>
<p>Mr. Crabbe and Mr. Goyle both giggled, causing Mr. Goyle to
quickly clap a hand to his mouth.</p>
<p>"We'd better go get our seats," Draco said. He hesitated,
straightened a bit, spoke a bit more fomally. "But I do want to
continue our last conversation and I accept your conditions."</p>
<p>Harry nodded. "Would you mind terribly if I waited until
Saturday afternoon? I'm in a bit of a contest right now."</p>
<p>"A contest?"</p>
<p>"See if I can read all my textbooks as fast as Hermione Granger
did."</p>
<p>"Granger," Draco echoed. His eyes narrowed. "The mudblood who
thinks she's Merlin? If you're trying to show <em>her</em> up then
all Slytherin wishes you the <em>very</em> best luck, Potter, and I
won't bother you 'til Saturday." Draco inclined his head
respectfully, and wandered off, tailed by his minions.</p>
<p><em>Oh, this is going to be</em> so <em>much fun to juggle, I
can already tell.</em></p>
<p>The classroom was filling up rapidly now with all four colors of
trim: green, red, yellow, and blue. Draco and his two friends
seemed to be in the midst of trying to acquire three contiguous
front-row seats - already occupied, of course. Mr. Crabbe and Mr.
Goyle were looming vigorously, but it didn't seem to be having much
effect.</p>
<p>Harry bent over his Defence textbook and continued reading.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>At 2:35PM, when most of the seats were taken and no one else
seemed to be coming in, Professor Quirrell gave a sudden jerk in
his chair and sat up straight, and his face appeared on all the
flat, white rectangular objects that were propped up on the
students' desks.</p>
<p>Harry was taken by surprise, both by the sudden appearance of
Professor Quirrell's face and by the resemblance to Muggle
television. There was something both nostalgic and sad about that,
it seemed so much like a piece of home and yet it wasn't
really...</p>
<p>"Good afternoon, my young apprentices," said Professor Quirrell.
His voice seemed to come from the desk screen and to be speaking
directly to Harry. "Welcome to your first lesson in Battle Magic,
as the founders of Hogwarts would have put it; or, as it happens to
be called in the late twentieth century, Defence Against the Dark
Arts."</p>
<p>There was a certain amount of frantic scrabbling as students,
taken by surprise, reached for their parchment or notebooks.</p>
<p>"No," Professor Quirrell said. "Don't bother writing down what
this subject was once called. No such pointless question will count
toward your marks in any of my lessons. That is a promise."</p>
<p>Many students sat straight up at that, looking rather
shocked.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was smiling thinly. "Those of you who have
wasted time by reading your useless first-year Defence textbooks
-"</p>
<p>Someone made a choking sound. Harry wondered if it was
Hermione.</p>
<p>"- may have gotten the impression that although this subject is
called Defence Against the Dark Arts, it is actually about how to
defend against Nightmare Butterflies, which cause mildly bad
dreams, or Acid Slugs, which can dissolve all the way through a
two-inch wooden beam given most of a day."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell stood up, shoving his chair back from the
desk. The screen on Harry's desk followed his every move. Professor
Quirrell strode towards the front of the classroom, and
bellowed:</p>
<p>"The Hungarian Horntail is taller than a dozen men! It breathes
fire so quickly and so accurately that it can melt a Snitch in
midflight! One Killing Curse will bring it down!"</p>
<p>There were gasps from the students.</p>
<p>"The Mountain Troll is more dangerous than the Hungarian
Horntail! It is strong enough to bite through steel! Its hide is
resistant enough to withstand Stunning Hexes and Cutting Charms!
Its sense of smell is so acute that it can tell from afar whether
its prey is part of a pack, or alone and vulnerable! Most fearsome
of all, the troll is unique among magical creatures in continuously
maintaining a form of Transfiguration on itself - it is always
transforming into its own body. If you somehow succeed in ripping
off its arm it will grow another within seconds! Fire and acid will
produce scar tissue which can temporarily confuse a troll's
regenerative powers - for an hour or two! They are smart enough to
use clubs as tools! The mountain troll is the third most perfect
killing machine in all Nature! One Killing Curse will bring it
down."</p>
<p>The students were looking rather shocked.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was smiling rather grimly. "Your sad excuse
for a third-year Defence textbook will suggest to you that you
expose the mountain troll to sunlight, which will freeze it in
place. This, my young apprentices, is the sort of useless knowledge
you will never find in my lessons. You do not encounter mountain
trolls in open daylight! The idea that you should use sunlight to
stop them is the result of foolish textbook authors trying to show
off their mastery of minutia at the expense of practicality. Just
because there is a ridiculously obscure way of dealing with
mountain trolls does not mean you should actually try to use it!
The Killing Curse is unblockable, unstoppable, and works every
single time on anything with a brain. If, as an adult wizard, you
find yourself incapable of using the Killing Curse, then you can
simply Apparate away! Likewise if you are facing the second most
perfect killing machine, a Dementor. You just Apparate away!"</p>
<p>"Unless, of course," Professor Quirrell said, his voice now
lower and harder, "you are under the influence of an
anti-Apparition jinx. No, there is exactly one monster which can
threaten you once you are fully grown. The single most dangerous
monster in all the world, so dangerous that nothing else comes
close. The Dark Wizard. That is the only thing that will still be
able to threaten you."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's lips were set in a thin line. "I will
reluctantly teach you enough trivia for a passing mark on the
Ministry-mandated portions of your first-year finals. Since your
exact mark on these sections will make no difference to your future
life, anyone who wants more than a passing mark is welcome to waste
their own time studying our pathetic excuse for a textbook. The
title of this subject is not Defence Against Minor Pests. You are
here to learn how to defend yourselves against the Dark Arts. Which
means, let us be very clear on this, defending yourselves against
Dark Wizards. People with wands who want to hurt you and who will
likely succeed in doing so unless you hurt them first! There is no
defence without offence! There is no defence without fighting! This
reality is deemed too harsh for eleven-year-olds by the fat,
overpaid, Auror-guarded politicians who mandated your curriculum.
To the abyss with those fools! You are here for the subject that
has been taught at Hogwarts for eight hundred years! Welcome to
your first year of Battle Magic!"</p>
<p>Harry started applauding. He couldn't help himself, it was too
inspiring.</p>
<p>Once Harry started clapping there was some scattered response
from Gryffindor, and more from Slytherin, but most students simply
seemed too stunned to react.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell made a cutting gesture, and the applause died
instantly. "Thank you very much," said Professor Quirrell. "Now to
practicalities. I have combined all my first-year Battle classes
into one, which allows me to offer you twice as much classroom time
as Doubles sessions -"</p>
<p>There were gasps of horror.</p>
<p>"- an increased load which I will make up to you by not
assigning any homework."</p>
<p>The gasps of horror cut off abruptly.</p>
<p>"Yes, you heard me correctly. I will teach you to fight, not to
write twelve inches on fighting due Monday."</p>
<p>Harry desperately wished he'd sat next to Hermione so he could
see the look on her face now, but on the other hand he was pretty
sure he was imagining it accurately.</p>
<p>Also Harry was in love. It would be a three-way wedding: him,
the Time-Turner, and Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>"For those of you who so choose, I have arranged some
after-school activities that I think you will find quite
interesting as well as educational. Do you want to show the world
your <em>own</em> abilities instead of watching fourteen other
people play Quidditch? More than seven people can fight in an
army."</p>
<p>Hot <em>damn.</em></p>
<p>"These and other after-school activities will also earn you
Quirrell points. What are Quirrell points, you ask? The House point
system does not suit my needs, because it makes House points too
rare. I prefer to let my students know how they are doing more
frequently than that. And on the rare occasions I offer you a
written test, it will mark itself as you go along, and if you get
too many related questions wrong, your test will show the names of
students who got those questions right, and those students will be
able to earn Quirrell points by helping you."</p>
<p>...wow. Why didn't the other professors use a system like
that?</p>
<p>"What good are Quirrell points, you wonder? For a start, ten
Quirrell points will be worth one House point. But they will earn
you other favors as well. Would you like to take your exam at an
unusual time? Is there a particular session you would very much
prefer to skip? You will find that I can be very flexible on behalf
of students who have accumulated enough Quirrell points. Quirrell
points will control the generalship of the armies. And for
Christmas - just before the Christmas break - I will grant someone
a wish. Any school-related feat that lies within my power, my
influence, or above all, my ingenuity. Yes, I was in Slytherin and
I am offering to formulate a cunning plot on your behalf, if that
is what it takes to accomplish your desire. This wish will go to
whoever has earned the most Quirrell points within all seven
years."</p>
<p>That would be Harry.</p>
<p>"Now leave your books and loose items at your desks - they will
be safe, the screens will watch over them for you - and come down
onto this platform. It's time to play a game called Who's the Most
Dangerous Student in the Classroom."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry twisted his wand in his right hand and said
"<em>Ma-ha-su!</em> "</p>
<p>There was another high-pitched "bing" from the floating blue
sphere that Professor Quirrell had assigned to Harry as his target.
That particular sound meant a perfect strike, which Harry had been
gotten on nine out of his last ten attempts.</p>
<p>Somewhere Professor Quirrell had dug up a spell that was
incredibly easy to pronounce, <em>and</em> had a ridiculously
simple wand motion, <em>and</em> had a tendency to hit wherever you
were currently looking at. Professor Quirrell had disdainfully
proclaimed that real battle magic was far more difficult than this.
That the hex was entirely useless in actual combat. That it was a
barely ordered burst of magic whose only real content was the
aiming, and that it would produce, when it hit, a pain briefly
equivalent to being punched hard in the nose. That the sole purpose
of this test was to see who was a fast learner, since Professor
Quirrell was certain no one would have previously encountered this
hex or anything like it.</p>
<p>Harry didn't care about any of that.</p>
<p>"<em>Ma-ha-su!</em> "</p>
<p>A <em>red bolt of energy</em> shot out of his wand and struck
the target and the blue sphere once again made the bing which meant
the spell had <em>actually worked for him.</em></p>
<p>Harry was feeling like a real wizard for the first time since
he'd come to Hogwarts. He wished the target would dodge like the
little spheres that Ben Kenobi had used for training Luke, but for
some reason Professor Quirrell had instead lined up all the
students and targets in neat orders which made sure they wouldn't
fire on each other.</p>
<p>So Harry lowered his wand, skipped to the right, snapped up his
wand and twisted and shouted "<em>Ma-ha-su!</em> "</p>
<p>There was a lower-pitched "dong" which meant he'd gotten it
almost right.</p>
<p>Harry put his wand into his pocket, skipped back to the left and
drew and fired another red bolt of energy.</p>
<p>The high-pitched bing which resulted was easily one of the most
satisfying sounds he'd heard in his life. Harry wanted to scream in
triumph at the top of his lungs. <em>I CAN DO MAGIC! FEAR ME, LAWS
OF PHYSICS, I'M COMING TO VIOLATE YOU!</em></p>
<p>"<em>Ma-ha-su!</em> " Harry's voice was loud, but hardly
noticeable over the steady chant of similar cries from around the
classroom platform.</p>
<p>"Enough," said Professor Quirrell's amplified voice. (It didn't
sound loud. It sounded like normal volume, coming from just behind
your left shoulder, no matter where you were standing relative to
Professor Quirrell.) "I see that all of you have succeeded at least
once now." The target-spheres turned red and began to drift up
towards the ceiling.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was standing on the raised dais in the center
of the platform, leaning slightly on his teacher's desk with one
hand.</p>
<p>"I told you," Professor Quirrell said, "that we would play a
game called Who's the Most Dangerous Student in the Classroom.
There is one student in this classroom who mastered the Sumerian
Simple Strike Hex faster than anyone else -"</p>
<p>Oh blah blah blah.</p>
<p>"- and went on to help seven other students. For which she has
earned the first seven Quirrell points awarded to your year. Come
forth, Hermione Granger. It is time for the next stage of the
game."</p>
<p>Hermione Granger began striding forwards, a mixed look of
triumph and apprehension on her face. The Ravenclaws looked on
proudly, the Slytherins with glares, and Harry with frank
annoyance. Harry had done fine this time. He was probably even in
the upper half of the class, now that everyone had been faced with
an equally unfamiliar spell and Harry had read all the way through
Adalbert Waffling's <em>Magical Theory</em>. And yet <em>Hermione
was still doing better</em>.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the back of his mind was the fear that Hermione was
simply smarter than him.</p>
<p>But for now Harry was going to pin his hopes on the known facts
that (a) Hermione had read a lot more than the standard textbooks
and (b) Adalbert Waffling was an uninspired sod who'd written
<em>Magical Theory</em> to pander to a school board that didn't
think much of eleven-year-olds.</p>
<p>Hermione reached the central dais and stepped up.</p>
<p>"Hermione Granger mastered a completely unfamiliar spell in two
minutes, almost a full minute faster than the next runner-up."
Professor Quirrell turned slowly in place to look at all the
students watching them. "Could Miss Granger's intelligence make her
the most dangerous student in the classroom? Well? What do you
think?"</p>
<p>No one seemed to be thinking anything at the moment. Even Harry
wasn't sure what to say.</p>
<p>"Let's find out, shall we?" said Professor Quirrell. He turned
back to Hermione, and gestured toward the wider class. "Select any
student you like and cast the Simple Strike Hex on them."</p>
<p>Hermione froze where she stood.</p>
<p>"Come now," Professor Quirrell said smoothly. "You have cast
this spell perfectly over fifty times. It is not permanently
harmful or even all that painful. It hurts as much as a hard punch
and lasts only a few seconds." Professor Quirrell's voice grew
harder. "This is a direct order from your professor, Miss Granger.
Choose a target and fire a Simple Strike Hex."</p>
<p>Hermione's face was screwed up in horror and her wand was
trembling in her hand. Harry's own fingers were clenching his own
wand hard in sympathy. Even though he could see what Professor
Quirrell was trying to do. Even though he could see the point
Professor Quirrell was trying to make.</p>
<p>"If you do <em>not</em> raise your wand and fire, Miss Granger,
you will lose a Quirrell point."</p>
<p>Harry stared at Hermione, willing her to look in his direction.
His right hand was softly tapping his own chest. <em>Pick me, I'm
not afraid...</em></p>
<p>Hermione's wand twitched in her hand; then her face relaxed, and
she lowered her wand to her side.</p>
<p>"No," said Hermione Granger.</p>
<p>Her voice was calm, and even though it wasn't loud, everyone
heard it in the silence.</p>
<p>"Then I must deduct one point from you," said Professor
Quirrell. "This is a test, and you have failed it."</p>
<p>That reached her. Harry could see it. But she kept her shoulders
straight.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's voice was sympathetic and seemed to fill
the whole room. "Knowing things isn't always enough, Miss Granger.
If you cannot give and receive violence on the order of stubbing
your toe, then you cannot defend yourself and you will not pass
Defence. Please rejoin your classmates."</p>
<p>Hermione walked back towards the Ravenclaw cluster. Her face
looked peaceful and Harry, for some odd reason, wanted to start
clapping. Even though Professor Quirrell had been
<em>right</em>.</p>
<p>"So," Professor Quirrell said. "It becomes clear that Hermione
Granger is not the most dangerous student in the classroom. Who do
you think might actually be the most dangerous person here? -
besides me, of course."</p>
<p>Without even thinking, Harry turned to look at the Slytherin
contingent.</p>
<p>"Draco, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy," said
Professor Quirrell. "It seems that many of your fellow pupils are
looking in your direction. Come forth, if you would."</p>
<p>Draco did so, walking with a certain pride in his bearing. He
stepped onto the dais and looked up at Professor Quirrell with a
smile.</p>
<p>"Mr. Malfoy," Professor Quirrell said. "Fire."</p>
<p>Harry would have tried to stop it if there'd been time but in
one smooth motion Draco spun on the Ravenclaw contingent and raised
his wand and said "<em>Mahasu!</em> " like it was all one syllable
and Hermione was saying "Ow!" and that was that.</p>
<p>"Well struck," said Professor Quirrell. "Two Quirrell points to
you. But tell me, why did you target Miss Granger?"</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>Finally Draco said, "Because she stood out the most."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's lips turned up in a thin smile. "And that
is the true reason why Draco Malfoy is dangerous. Had he selected
any other, that child would more likely resent being singled out,
and Mr. Malfoy would more probably make an enemy. And while Mr.
Malfoy might have given some other justification for selecting her,
that would have served him no purpose save to alienate some of you,
while others are already cheering him whether he says anything or
not. Which is to say that Mr. Malfoy is dangerous because he knows
who to strike and who not to strike, how to make allies and avoid
making enemies. Two more Quirrell points to you, Mr. Malfoy. And as
you have demonstrated an exemplary virtue of Slytherin, I think
that Salazar's House has earned a point as well. You may rejoin
your friends."</p>
<p>Draco bowed slightly and walked back to the Slytherin
contingent. Some clapping started from the green-trimmed robes, but
Professor Quirrell made a cutting gesture and silence fell
again.</p>
<p>"It might seem that our game is done," said Professor Quirrell.
"And yet there is a single student in this classroom who is more
dangerous than the scion of Malfoy."</p>
<p>And <em>now</em> for some reason there seemed to be an awful lot
of people looking at...</p>
<p>"Harry Potter. Come forth."</p>
<p>This did not bode well.</p>
<p>Harry reluctantly walked towards where Professor Quirrell stood
on his raised dais, still leaning slightly against his teacher's
desk.</p>
<p>The nervousness of being put into the spotlight seemed to be
sharpening Harry's wits as he approached the dais, and his mind was
ruffling through possibilities for what Professor Quirrell might
think could demonstrate Harry's dangerousness. Would he be asked to
cast a spell? To defeat a Dark Lord?</p>
<p>Demonstrate his supposed immunity to the Killing Curse? Surely
Professor Quirrell was too smart for <em>that</em>...</p>
<p>Harry stopped well short of the dais, and Professor Quirrell
didn't ask him to come any closer.</p>
<p>"The irony is," said Professor Quirrell, "you all looked at the
right person for entirely the wrong reasons. You are thinking,"
Professor Quirrell's lips twisted, "that Harry Potter has defeated
the Dark Lord, and so must be very dangerous. Bah. He was one year
old. Whatever quirk of fate killed the Dark Lord likely had little
to do with Mr. Potter's abilities as a fighter. But after I heard
rumors of one Ravenclaw facing down five older Slytherins, I
interviewed several eyewitnesses and came to the conclusion that
Harry Potter would be my most dangerous student."</p>
<p>A jolt of adrenaline poured into Harry's system, making him
stand up straighter. He didn't know what conclusion Professor
Quirrell had come to, but that couldn't be good.</p>
<p>"Ah, Professor Quirrell -" Harry started to say.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell looked amused. "You're thinking that I've
come up with a wrong answer, aren't you, Mr. Potter? You will learn
to expect better of <em>me</em>." Professor Quirrell straightened
from where he had leaned on the desk. "Mr. Potter, all things have
their accustomed uses. Give me ten unaccustomed uses of objects in
this room for combat!"</p>
<p>For a moment Harry was rendered speechless by the sheer, raw
shock of having been understood.</p>
<p>And then the ideas started to pour out.</p>
<p>"There are desks which are heavy enough to be fatal if dropped
from a great height. There are chairs with metal legs that could
impale someone if driven hard enough. The air in this classroom
would be deadly by its absence, since people die in vacuum, and it
can serve as a carrier for poison gases."</p>
<p>Harry had to stop briefly for breath, and into that pause
Professor Quirrell said:</p>
<p>"That's three. You need ten. The rest of the class thinks that
you've already used up the whole contents of the classroom."</p>
<p>"<em>Ha!</em> The floor can be removed to create a spike pit to
fall into, the ceiling can be collapsed on someone, the walls can
serve as raw material for Transfiguration into any number of deadly
things - knives, say."</p>
<p>"That's six. But surely you're scraping the bottom of the barrel
now?"</p>
<p>"I haven't even started! Just look at all the people! Having a
Gryffindor attack the enemy is an <em>ordinary</em> use, of course
-"</p>
<p>"I will not count that one."</p>
<p>"- but their blood can also be used to drown someone. Ravenclaws
are known for their brains, but their internal organs could be sold
on the black market for enough money to hire an assassin.
Slytherins aren't just useful as assassins, they can also be thrown
at sufficient velocity to crush an enemy. And Hufflepuffs, in
addition to being hard workers, also contain bones that can be
removed, sharpened, and used to stab someone."</p>
<p>By now the rest of the class was staring at Harry in some
horror. Even the Slytherins looked shocked.</p>
<p>"That's ten, though I'm being generous in counting the Ravenclaw
one. Now, for extra credit, one Quirrell point for each use of
objects in this room which you have not yet named." Professor
Quirrell favored Harry with a companionable smile. "The rest of
your class thinks you are in trouble now, since you've named
everything except the targets and you have no idea what may be done
with those."</p>
<p>"Bah! I've named all the people, but not my robes, which can be
used to suffocate an enemy if wrapped around their head enough
times, or Hermione Granger's robes, which can be torn into strips
and tied into a rope and used to hang someone, or Draco Malfoy's
robes, which can be used to start a fire -"</p>
<p>"Three points," said Professor Quirrell, "no more clothing
now."</p>
<p>"My wand can be pushed into an enemy's brain through their eye
socket" and someone made a horrified, strangling sound.</p>
<p>"Four points, no more wands."</p>
<p>"My wristwatch could suffocate someone if jammed down their
throat -"</p>
<p>"Five points, and enough."</p>
<p>"Hmph," Harry said. "Ten Quirrell points to one House point,
right? You should have let me keep going until I'd won the House
Cup, I haven't even started yet on the unaccustomed uses of
everything I've got in my pockets" or the mokeskin pouch itself and
he couldn't talk about the Time-Turner or the invisibility cloak
but there had to be <em>something</em> he could say about those red
spheres...</p>
<p>"<em>Enough,</em> Mr. Potter. Well, do you all think you
understand what makes Mr. Potter the most dangerous student in the
classroom?"</p>
<p>There was a low murmur of assent.</p>
<p>"Say it out loud, please. Terry Boot, what makes your dorm-mate
dangerous?"</p>
<p>"Ah... um... he's creative?"</p>
<p>"<em>Wrong!</em> " bellowed Professor Quirrell, and his fist
came down sharply on his desk with an amplified sound that made
everyone jump. "All of Mr. Potter's ideas were worse than
useless!"</p>
<p>Harry started in surprise.</p>
<p>"Remove the floor to create a spike trap? Ridiculous! In combat
you do not have that sort of preparation time and if you did there
would be a hundred better uses! Transfigure material from the
walls? Mr. Potter cannot perform Transfiguration! Mr. Potter had
exactly one idea which he could use immediately, right now, without
extensive preparation or a cooperative enemy or magic he does not
know. That idea was to jam his wand through his enemy's eye socket.
Which would be more likely to break his wand than kill his
opponent! In short, Mr. Potter, I'm afraid that your proposals were
uniformly awful."</p>
<p>"What?" Harry said indignantly. "You <em>asked</em> for unusual
ideas, not practical ones! I was thinking outside the box! How
would <em>you</em> use something in this classroom to kill
someone?"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's expression was disapproving, but there were
smile crinkles around his eyes. "Mr. Potter, I never said you were
to <em>kill.</em> There is a time and a place for taking your enemy
alive, and inside a Hogwarts classroom is usually one of those
places. But to answer your question, hit them on the neck with the
edge of a chair."</p>
<p>There was some laughter from the Slytherins, but they were
laughing with Harry, not at him.</p>
<p>Everyone else was looking rather horrified.</p>
<p>"But Mr. Potter has now demonstrated why he is the most
dangerous student in the classroom. I asked for unaccustomed uses
of items in this room for combat. Mr. Potter could have suggested
using a desk to block a curse, or using a chair to trip an oncoming
enemy, or wrapping cloth around his arm to create an improvised
shield. Instead, every single use that Mr. Potter named was
offensive rather than defensive, and either fatal or potentially
fatal."</p>
<p>What? Wait, that couldn't be true... Harry had a sudden sense of
vertigo as he tried to remember what exactly he'd suggested, surely
there had to be a counterexample...</p>
<p>"And that," Professor Quirrell said, "is why Mr. Potter's ideas
were so strange and useless - because he had to reach far into the
impractical in order to meet his standard of <em>killing the
enemy.</em> To him, any idea which fell short of that was not worth
considering. This reflects a quality that we might call <em>intent
to kill</em>. I have it. Harry Potter has it, which is how he could
stare down five older Slytherins. Draco Malfoy does not have it,
not yet. Mr. Malfoy would hardly shrink from talk of ordinary
murder, but even he was shocked - yes you were Mr. Malfoy, I was
watching your face - when Mr. Potter described how to use his
classmates' bodies as raw material. There are censors inside your
mind which make you flinch away from thoughts like that. Mr. Potter
thinks <em>purely</em> of killing the enemy, he will grasp at any
means to do so, he does not flinch, his censors are off. Even
though his youthful genius is so undisciplined and impractical as
to be useless, his <em>intent to kill</em> makes Harry Potter the
Most Dangerous Student in the Classroom. One final point to him -
no, let us make that a point to Ravenclaw - for this indispensable
requisite of a true fighting wizard."</p>
<p>Harry's mouth gaped open in speechless shock as he searched
frantically for something to say to this. <em>That is so completely
not what I am about!</em></p>
<p>But he could see that the other students were starting to
believe it. Harry's mind was flipping through possible denials and
not finding anything that could stand up against the authoritative
voice of Professor Quirrell. The best Harry had come up with was
"I'm not a psychopath, I'm just very creative" and that sounded
kind of ominous. He needed to say something unexpected, something
that would make people stop and reconsider -</p>
<p>"And now," Professor Quirrell said. "Mr. Potter. Fire."</p>
<p>Nothing happened, of course.</p>
<p>"Ah, well," said Professor Quirrell. He sighed. "I suppose we
must all start somewhere. Mr. Potter, select any student you please
for a Simple Strike Hex. You <em>will</em> do so before I dismiss
your class for the day. If you do not, I will begin deducting House
points, and I will keep on deducting them until you do."</p>
<p>Harry carefully raised his wand. He had to do that much, or
Professor Quirrell might start deducting House points right
away.</p>
<p>Slowly, as though on a roasting platter, Harry turned to face
the Slytherins.</p>
<p>And Harry's eyes met Draco's.</p>
<p>Draco Malfoy didn't look the slightest bit afraid. The
blonde-haired boy wasn't giving any visible sign of assent such as
Harry had given Hermione, but then he could hardly be expected to
do so. The other Slytherins would think that rather odd.</p>
<p>"Why the hesitation?" said Professor Quirrell. "Surely there's
only one obvious choice."</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said. "Only one <em>obvious</em> choice."</p>
<p>Harry twisted the wand and said "<em>Ma-ha-su!</em> "</p>
<p>There was complete silence in the classroom.</p>
<p>Harry shook his left arm, trying to get rid of the lingering
sting.</p>
<p>There was more silence.</p>
<p>Finally Professor Quirrell sighed. "Yes, quite ingenious, but
there was a lesson to be taught and you dodged it. One point from
Ravenclaw for showing off your own cleverness at the expense of the
actual goal. Class dismissed."</p>
<p>And before anyone else could say anything, Harry sang out:</p>
<p>"Just kidding! RAVENCLAW!"</p>
<p>There was silence for a brief moment after that, a sound of
people thinking, and then the murmurs started and rapidly rose to a
roar of conversation.</p>
<p>Harry turned towards Professor Quirrell, the two of them needed
to talk -</p>
<p>Quirrell had slumped over and was trudging back to his
chair.</p>
<p>No. Not acceptable. They <em>really</em> needed to talk. Stuff
the zombie act, Professor Quirrell would probably wake up if Harry
poked him a couple of times. Harry started forward -</p>
<p><em>WRONG<br>
DON'T<br>
BAD IDEA</em></p>
<p>Harry swayed and stopped in his tracks, feeling dizzy.</p>
<p>And then a flock of Ravenclaws descended on him and the
discussions began.</p>

<p>The office of the Deputy Headmistress was clean and
well-organised; on the wall immediately adjacent to the desk was a
maze of wooden cubbyholes of all shapes and sizes, most with
several parchment scrolls thrust into them, and it was somehow very
clear that Professor McGonagall knew exactly what every cubbyhole
meant, even if no one else did. A single parchment lay on the
actual desk, which was, aside from that, clean. Behind the desk was
a closed door barred with several locks.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall was sitting on a backless stool behind the
desk, looking puzzled - her eyes had widened, with perhaps a slight
note of apprehension, as she saw Harry.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter?" said Professor McGonagall. "What is this
about?"</p>
<p>Harry's mind went blank. He'd been instructed by the game to
come here, he had been expecting <em>her</em> to have something in
mind...</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter?" said Professor McGonagall, starting to look
slightly annoyed.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Harry's panicking brain remembered at this point
that he <em>did</em> have something he'd been planning to discuss
with Professor McGonagall. Something important and well worth her
time.</p>
<p>"Um..." Harry said. "If there are any spells you can cast to
make sure no one's listening to us..."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall stood up from her chair, firmly closed the
outer door, and began taking out her wand and saying spells.</p>
<p>It was at this point that Harry realised he was faced with a
priceless and possibly irreplaceable opportunity to offer Professor
McGonagall a Comed-Tea and he couldn't believe he was seriously
thinking that and it would be fine the soda would vanish after a
few seconds and he told that part of himself to <em>shut
up.</em></p>
<p>It did, and Harry began to organise mentally what he was going
to say. He hadn't planned to have this discussion <em>quite</em> so
soon, but so long as he was here...</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall finished a spell that sounded a lot older
than Latin, and then she sat down again.</p>
<p>"All right," she said in a quiet voice. "No one's listening."
Her face was rather tight.</p>
<p><em>Oh, right, she's expecting me to blackmail her for
information about the prophecy.</em></p>
<p>Eh, Harry'd get around to that some other day.</p>
<p>"It's about the Incident with the Sorting Hat," Harry said.
(Professor McGonagall blinked.) "Um... I think there's an extra
spell on the Sorting Hat, something that the Sorting Hat itself
doesn't know about, something that triggers when the Sorting Hat
says Slytherin. I heard a message that I'm pretty sure Ravenclaws
aren't supposed to hear. It came the moment the Sorting Hat was off
my head and I felt the connection break. It sounded like a hiss and
like English at the same time," there was a sharp intake of breath
from McGonagall, "and it said: Salutations from Slytherin to
Slytherin, if you would seek my secrets, speak to my snake."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall sat there with her mouth open, staring at
Harry as if he'd grown another two heads.</p>
<p>"So..." Professor McGonagall said slowly, as though she couldn't
believe the words that were coming out of her own lips, "you
decided to come to me right away and tell me about it."</p>
<p>"Well, yes, of course," Harry said. There was no need to admit
how long it had taken him to actually think of that. "As opposed
to, say, trying to research it myself, or telling any of the other
children."</p>
<p>"I... see," Professor McGonagall said. "And if, perhaps, you
were to discover the entrance to Salazar Slytherin's legendary
Chamber of Secrets, an entrance that you and you alone could
open..."</p>
<p>"I would close the entrance and report to you at once so that a
team of experienced magical archaeologists could be assembled,"
Harry said promptly. "Then I would open up the entrance again and
they would go in very carefully to make sure that there was nothing
dangerous. I might go in later to look around, or if they needed me
to open up something else, but it would be after the area had been
declared clear and they had photographs of how everything looked
before people started tromping around their priceless historical
site."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall sat there with her mouth open, staring at
him like he'd just turned into a cat.</p>
<p>"It's obvious if you're not a Gryffindor," Harry said
kindly.</p>
<p>"I think," Professor McGonagall said in a rather choked voice,
"that you <em>far</em> underestimate the rarity of common sense,
Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>That sounded about right. Although... "A Hufflepuff would've
said the same thing."</p>
<p>McGonagall paused, struck. "<em>That's</em> true."</p>
<p>"Sorting Hat offered me Hufflepuff."</p>
<p>She blinked at him as though she couldn't believe her own ears.
"Did it <em>really?</em> "</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter," McGonagall said, and now her voice was low, "five
decades ago was the last time a student died within the walls of
Hogwarts, and I am now certain that five decades ago was the last
time someone heard that message."</p>
<p>A chill went through Harry. "Then I will be <em>very</em> sure
to take no action <em>whatsoever</em> on this matter without
consulting you, Professor McGonagall." He paused. "And may I
suggest that you get together the best people you can find and see
if it's possible to get that extra spell off the Sorting Hat... and
if you can't do that, maybe put on <em>another</em> spell, a
Quietus that briefly activates just as the Hat is being removed
from a student's head, that might work as a patch. There, no more
dead students." Harry nodded in satisfaction.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall looked even more stunned, if such a thing
were imaginable. "I cannot <em>possibly</em> award you enough
points for this without giving the House Cup to Ravenclaw
outright."</p>
<p>"Um," Harry said. "Um. I'd rather not earn <em>that</em> many
House points."</p>
<p>Now Professor McGonagall was giving him a strange look. "Why
not?"</p>
<p>Harry was having a little difficulty putting it into words.
"Because it would be just too sad, you know? Like... like back when
I was still trying to go to school in the Muggle world, and
whenever there was a group project, I'd go ahead and do the whole
thing myself because the others would only slow me down. I'm fine
with earning lots of points, more than anyone else even, but if I
earn enough to be decisive in winning the House Cup just by myself,
then it's like I'm carrying House Ravenclaw on my back and that's
too sad."</p>
<p>"I see..." McGonagall said hesitantly. It was apparent that this
way of thinking had never occurred to her. "Suppose I only awarded
you fifty points, then?"</p>
<p>Harry shook his head again. "It's not fair to the other children
if I earn lots of points for grownup things that I can be part of
and they can't. How is Terry Boot supposed to earn fifty points for
reporting a whisper he heard from the Sorting Hat? It wouldn't be
fair at all."</p>
<p>"I see why the Sorting Hat offered you Hufflepuff," said
Professor McGonagall. She was eyeing him with a strange
respect.</p>
<p>That made Harry choke up a bit. He'd honestly thought he wasn't
worthy of Hufflepuff. That the Sorting Hat had just been trying to
shove him anywhere but Ravenclaw, into a House whose virtues he
didn't have...</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall was smiling now. "And if I tried to give
you <em>ten</em> points...?"</p>
<p>"Are you going to explain where those ten points came from, if
anyone asks? There might be a lot of Slytherins, and I don't mean
the children at Hogwarts, who would be really <em>really</em> angry
if they knew about the spell being taken off the Sorting Hat and
found out I was involved. So I think that absolute secrecy is the
better part of valour. No need to thank me, ma'am, virtue is its
own reward."</p>
<p>"So it is," Professor McGonagall said, "but I do have a very
special something else to give you. I see that I have greatly
wronged you in my thoughts, Mr. Potter. Please wait here."</p>
<p>She got up, went over to the locked back door, waved her wand,
and a sort of blurry curtain sprang up around her. Harry could
neither see nor hear what was going on. It was a few minutes later
that the blur vanished and Professor McGonagall was standing there,
facing him, with the door behind her looking as though it hadn't
ever been opened.</p>
<p>And Professor McGonagall held out in one hand a necklace, a thin
golden chain bearing in its center a silver circle, within which
was the device of an hourglass. In her other hand was a folded
pamphlet. "This is for you," she said.</p>
<p>Wow! He was going to get some sort of neat magical item as a
quest reward! Apparently that business with refusing offers of
monetary rewards until you got a magic item actually worked in real
life, not just computer games.</p>
<p>Harry accepted his new necklace, smiling. "What is it?"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall took a breath. "Mr. Potter, this is an item
which is ordinarily lent only to children who have already shown
themselves to be highly responsible, in order to help them with
difficult class schedules." McGonagall hesitated, as though about
to add something else. "I <em>must</em> emphasise, Mr. Potter, that
this item's true nature is <em>secret</em> and that you must
<em>not</em> tell any of the other students about it, or let them
see you using it. If that's not acceptable to you, then you can
give it back now."</p>
<p>"I can keep secrets," Harry said. "So what does it do?"</p>
<p>"So far as the other students are concerned, this is a Spimster
wicket and it is used to treat a rare, non-contagious magical
ailment called Spontaneous Duplication. You wear it under your
clothes, and while you have no reason to show it to anyone, you
also have no reason to treat it as an awful secret. Spimster
wickets are not interesting. Do you understand, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>Harry nodded, his smile widening. He sensed the work of a
<em>competent</em> Slytherin. "And what does it <em>really</em>
do?"</p>
<p>"It's a Time-Turner. Each spin of the hourglass sends you one
hour back in time. So if you use it to go back two hours every day,
you should always be able to get to sleep at the same time."</p>
<p>Harry's suspension of disbelief blew completely out the
window.</p>
<p><em>You're giving me a time machine to treat my sleep
disorder.</em></p>
<p><em>You're giving me a TIME MACHINE to treat my SLEEP
DISORDER.</em></p>
<p><em>YOU'RE <strong>GIVING ME A TIME MACHINE</strong> IN ORDER TO
<strong>TREAT MY SLEEP DISORDER</strong>.</em></p>
<p>"Ehehehehhheheh..." Harry's mouth said. He was now holding the
necklace away from him as though it were a live bomb. Well, no, not
as if it were a live bomb, that didn't <em>begin</em> to describe
the severity of the situation. Harry held the necklace away from
him as though it were a time machine.</p>
<p><em>Say, Professor McGonagall, did you know that time-reversed
ordinary matter looks just like antimatter? Why yes it does! Did
you know that one kilogram of antimatter encountering one kilogram
of matter will annihilate in an explosion equivalent to 43 million
tons of TNT? Do you realise that I myself weigh 41 kilograms and
that the resulting blast would leave A GIANT SMOKING CRATER WHERE
THERE USED TO BE SCOTLAND?</em></p>
<p>"Excuse me," Harry managed to say, "but this sounds really
really <em>really REALLY DANGEROUS!</em> " Harry's voice didn't
quite rise to a shriek, he couldn't possibly scream loud enough to
do this situation justice so there was no point in trying.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall looked upon him with tolerant affection.
"I'm glad you're taking this seriously, Mr. Potter, but
Time-Turners aren't <em>that</em> dangerous. We wouldn't give them
to children if they were."</p>
<p>"Really," Harry said. "Ahahahaha. Of course you wouldn't give
time machines to children if they were dangerous, what <em>was</em>
I thinking? So just to be clear, sneezing on this device will
<em>not</em> send me into the Middle Ages where I will run over
Gutenberg with a horse cart and prevent the Enlightenment? Because,
you know, I hate it when that happens to me."</p>
<p>McGonagall's lips were twitching in that way she had when she
was trying not to smile. She offered Harry the pamphlet she was
holding, but Harry was carefully holding out the necklace with both
hands and staring at the hourglass to make sure it wasn't about to
turn. "Don't worry," McGonagall said after a momentary pause, when
it became clear that Harry wasn't going to move, "that can't
possibly happen, Mr. Potter. The Time-Turner cannot be used to move
more than six hours backwards. It can't be used more than six times
in any day."</p>
<p>"Oh, good, very good, that. And if someone bumps into me the
Time-Turner will <em>not</em> break and will <em>not</em> trap the
whole castle of Hogwarts in an endlessly repeating loop of
Thursdays."</p>
<p>"Well, they <em>can</em> be fragile..." said McGonagall. "And I
do think I've heard about strange things happening if they're
broken. But nothing like <em>that!</em> "</p>
<p>"Perhaps," Harry said when he could speak again, "you ought to
provide your time machines with some sort of <em>protective
shell</em>, rather than <em>leaving the glass exposed</em>, so as
to <em>prevent that from happening</em>."</p>
<p>McGonagall looked quite struck. "That's an excellent idea, Mr.
Potter. I shall inform the Ministry of it."</p>
<p><em>That's it, it's official now, they've ratified it in
Parliament, everyone in the wizarding world is completely
stupid.</em></p>
<p>"And while I hate to get all <em>PHILOSOPHICAL,</em>" Harry
desperately tried to lower his voice to something under a shriek,
"has anyone thought about the <em>IMPLICATIONS</em> of going back
six hours and doing something that changes time which would pretty
much <em>DELETE ALL THE PEOPLE AFFECTED</em> and <em>REPLACE THEM
WITH DIFFERENT VERSIONS -</em>"</p>
<p>"Oh, you can't <em>change</em> time!" Professor McGonagall
interrupted. "Good heavens, Mr. Potter, do you think these would be
allowed students if <em>that</em> was possible? What if someone
tried to change their test scores?"</p>
<p>Harry took a moment to process this. His hands relaxed, just a
little, from their white grip on the hourglass chain. Like he
wasn't holding a time machine, just a live nuclear warhead.</p>
<p>"So..." Harry said slowly. "People just find that the
universe... happens to be self-consistent, somehow, even though it
has time-travel in it. If I and my future self interact then I'll
see the same thing as both of me, even though, on my own first run
through, my future self is already acting in full knowledge of
things that, from my own perspective, haven't happened yet..."
Harry's voice trailed off into the inadequacy of English.</p>
<p>"Correct, I think," said Professor McGonagall. "Although wizards
<em>are</em> advised to avoid being seen by their past selves. If
you're attending two classes at the same time and you need to cross
paths with yourself, for example, the first version of you should
step aside and close his eyes at a known time - you have a watch
already, good - so that the future you can pass. It's all there in
the pamphlet."</p>
<p>"Ahahahaa. And what happens when someone <em>ignores</em> that
advice?"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall pursed her lips. "I understand that it can
be quite disconcerting."</p>
<p>"And it doesn't, say, create a paradox that destroys the
universe."</p>
<p>She smiled tolerantly. "Mr. Potter, I think I'd remember hearing
if <em>that</em> had ever happened."</p>
<p>"<em>THAT IS NOT REASSURING! HAVEN'T YOU PEOPLE EVER HEARD OF
THE ANTHROPIC PRINCIPLE? AND WHAT IDIOT EVER BUILT ONE OF THESE
THINGS FOR THE FIRST TIME?</em> "</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall actually laughed. It was a pleasant, glad
sound that seemed surprisingly out of place on that stern face.
"You're having another 'you turned into a cat' moment, aren't you,
Mr. Potter. You probably don't want to hear this, but it's quite
endearingly cute."</p>
<p>"Turning into a cat doesn't even <em>BEGIN</em> to compare to
this. You know right up until this moment I had this awful
suppressed thought somewhere in the back of my mind that the only
remaining answer was that my whole universe was a computer
simulation like in the book <em>Simulacron 3</em> but now <em>even
that is ruled out</em> because this little toy <em>ISN'T TURING
COMPUTABLE!</em> A Turing machine could simulate going back into a
defined moment of the past and computing a different future from
there, an oracle machine could rely on the halting behavior of
lower-order machines, but what you're saying is that reality
somehow self-consistently computes in one sweep using information
that hasn't... happened... yet..."</p>
<p>Realisation struck Harry a pile-driver blow.</p>
<p>It all made sense now. It all <em>finally</em> made sense.</p>
<p>"<em>SO THAT'S HOW THE COMED-TEA WORKS!</em> Of <em>course!</em>
The spell doesn't <em>force</em> funny events to happen, it just
makes you <em>feel an impulse to drink</em> right before funny
things are going to happen anyway! I'm such a fool, I should have
realised when I felt the impulse to drink the Comed-Tea before
Dumbledore's second speech, <em>didn't</em> drink it, and then
choked on my own saliva instead - drinking the Comed-Tea doesn't
cause the comedy, the comedy causes you to drink the Comed-Tea! I
saw the two events were correlated and assumed the Comed-Tea had to
be the cause and the comedy had to be the effect because I thought
temporal order restrained causation and causal graphs had to be
acyclic BUT IT ALL MAKES SENSE ONCE YOU DRAW THE CAUSAL ARROWS
GOING <em>BACKWARDS IN TIME!</em> "</p>
<p>Realisation struck Harry the <em>second</em> pile-driver.</p>
<p>This one he managed to keep quiet, making only a small
strangling sound like a dying kitten as he realised who'd put the
note on his bed this morning.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall's eyes were alight. "After you graduate, or
possibly even before, you really <em>must</em> teach some of these
Muggle theories at Hogwarts, Mr. Potter. They sound quite
fascinating, even if they're all wrong."</p>
<p>"Glehhahhh..."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall offered him a few more pleasantries,
demanded a few more promises to which Harry nodded, said something
about not talking to snakes where anyone could hear him, reminded
him to read the pamphlet, and then somehow Harry found himself
standing outside her office with the door closed firmly behind
him.</p>
<p>"Gaahhhrrrraa..." Harry said.</p>
<p>Why yes his mind <em>was</em> blown.</p>
<p>Not least by the fact that, if not for the Prank, he might well
have never obtained a Time-Turner in the first place.</p>
<p>Or would Professor McGonagall have given it to him anyway, only
later in the day, whenever he got around to asking about his sleep
disorder or telling her about the Sorting Hat's message? And would
he, at that time, have wanted to pull a prank on himself which
would have led to him getting the Time-Turner <em>earlier?</em> So
that the only <em>self-consistent</em> possibility was the one in
which the Prank started before he even woke up in the
morning...?</p>
<p>Harry found himself considering, for the first time in his life,
that the answer to his question might be literally
<em>inconceivable.</em> That since his own brain contained neurons
that only ran forwards in time, there was <em>nothing</em> his
brain could do, no operation it could perform, which was conjugate
to the operation of a Time Turner.</p>
<p>Up until this point Harry had lived by the admonition of E. T.
Jaynes that if you were ignorant about a phenomenon, that was a
fact about your own state of mind, not a fact about the phenomenon
itself; that your uncertainty was a fact about you, not a fact
about whatever you were uncertain about; that ignorance existed in
the mind, not in reality; that a blank map did not correspond to a
blank territory. There were mysterious questions, but a mysterious
answer was a contradiction in terms. A phenomenon could be
mysterious <em>to</em> some particular person, but there could be
no phenomena mysterious of themselves. To worship a sacred mystery
was just to worship your own ignorance.</p>
<p>So Harry had looked upon magic and refused to be intimidated.
People had no sense of history, they learned about chemistry and
biology and astronomy and thought that these matters had always
been the proper meat of science, that they had <em>never been</em>
mysterious. The stars had once been mysteries. Lord Kelvin had once
called the nature of life and biology - the response of muscles to
human will and the generation of trees from seeds - a mystery
"infinitely beyond" the reach of science. (Not just a little
beyond, mind you, but <em>infinitely</em> beyond. Lord Kelvin
certainly had felt a huge emotional charge from <em>not knowing
something</em>.) Every mystery ever solved had been a puzzle from
the dawn of the human species right up until someone solved it.</p>
<p>Now, for the first time, he was up against the prospect of a
mystery that was threatening to be <em>permanent</em>. If Time
didn't work by acyclic causal networks then Harry didn't understand
what was meant by cause and effect; and if Harry didn't understand
causes and effects then he didn't understand what sort of stuff
reality might be made of instead; and it was entirely possible that
his human mind never <em>could</em> understand, because his brain
was made of <em>old-fashioned linear-time neurons,</em> and this
had turned out to be an impoverished subset of reality.</p>
<p>On the plus side, the Comed-Tea, which had once seemed
all-powerful and all-unbelievable, had turned out to have a much
simpler explanation. Which he'd missed <em>merely</em> because the
truth was completely outside his hypothesis space or anything that
his brain had evolved to comprehend. But now he actually
<em>had</em> figured it, probably. Which was sort of encouraging.
Sort of.</p>
<p>Harry glanced down at his watch. It was nearly 11AM, he'd gotten
to sleep last night at 1AM, so in the natural state of affairs he'd
go to sleep tonight at 3AM. So to go to sleep at 10PM and wake up
at 7AM, he should go back five hours total. Which meant that if he
wanted to get back to his dorm at around 6AM, before anyone was
awake, he'd better hurry up and...</p>
<p>Even in <em>retrospect</em> Harry didn't understand how he'd
pulled off <em>half</em> the stuff involved in the Prank. Where had
the <em>pie</em> come from?</p>
<p>Harry was starting to seriously fear time travel.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he had to admit that it <em>had</em> been an
irreplaceable opportunity. A prank you could only pull on yourself
once in a lifetime, within six hours of when you first found out
about Time-Turners.</p>
<p>In fact that was even <em>more</em> puzzling, when Harry thought
about it. Time had presented him with the finished Prank as a
<em>fait accompli,</em> and yet it was, quite clearly, his own
handiwork. Concept and execution and writing style. Every last
part, even the ones he still didn't understand.</p>
<p>Well, time was a-wasting and there were at most thirty hours in
a day. Harry did know <em>some</em> of what he had to do, and he
might figure out the rest, like the pie, while he was working.
There was no point putting it off. He couldn't exactly accomplish
anything stuck here in the <em>future.</em></p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Five hours earlier, Harry was sneaking into his dorm with his
robes pulled up over his head as a thin sort of disguise, just in
case someone was already up and about and saw him at the same time
as Harry lying in his bed. He didn't want to have to explain to
anyone about his little medical problem with Spontaneous
Duplication.</p>
<p>Fortunately it seemed that everyone was still asleep.</p>
<p>And there also seemed to be a box, wrapped in red and green
paper with a bright golden ribbon, lying next to his bed. The
perfect, stereotypical image of a Christmas present, although it
wasn't Christmas.</p>
<p>Harry crept in as softly as he could manage, just in case
someone had their Quieter turned down low.</p>
<p>There was an envelope attached to the box, closed by plain clear
wax without a seal impressed.</p>
<p>Harry carefully pried the envelope open, and took out the letter
inside.</p>
<p>The letter said:</p>
<p><em>This is the Cloak of Invisibility of Ignotus Peverell,
passed down through his descendants the Potters. Unlike lesser
cloaks and spells it has the power to keep you <span style="text-decoration:underline;">hidden</span>, not merely invisible.
Your father lent it to me to study shortly before he died, and I
confess that I have received much good use of it over the
years.</em></p>
<p><em>In the future I shall have to get along with
Disillusionment, I fear. It is time the Cloak was returned to you,
its heir. I had thought to make this a Christmas present, but it
wished to come back to your hand before then. It seems to expect
you to have need of it. Use it well.</em></p>
<p><em>No doubt you are already thinking of all manner of wonderful
pranks, as your father committed in his day. If his full misdeeds
were known, every woman in Gryffindor would gather to desecrate his
grave. I shall not try to stop history from repeating, but be MOST
careful not to reveal yourself. If Dumbledore saw a chance to
possess one of the Deathly Hallows, he would never let it escape
his grasp until the day he died.</em></p>
<p><em>A Very Merry Christmas to you.</em></p>
<p>The note was unsigned.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"Hold on," Harry said, pulling up short as the other boys were
about to leave the Ravenclaw dorm. "Sorry, there's something else
I've got to do with my trunk. I'll be along to breakfast in a
couple of minutes."</p>
<p>Terry Boot scowled at Harry. "You'd better not be planning to go
through any of our things."</p>
<p>Harry held up one hand. "I swear that I intend to do nothing of
the sort to any of your things, that I only intend to access
objects that I myself own, that I have no pranking or otherwise
questionable intentions towards any of you, and that I do not
anticipate those intentions changing before I get to breakfast in
the Great Hall."</p>
<p>Terry frowned. "Wait, is that -"</p>
<p>"Don't worry," said Penelope Clearwater, who was there to guide
them. "There were no loopholes. Well-worded, Potter, you should be
a lawyer."</p>
<p>Harry Potter blinked at that. Ah, yes, Ravenclaw
<em>prefect.</em> "Thank you," he said. "I think."</p>
<p>"When you try to find the Great Hall, you will get lost."
Penelope stated this in the tones of a flat, unarguable fact. "As
soon as you do, ask a portrait how to get to the first floor. Ask
another portrait the <em>instant</em> you suspect you might be lost
again. <em>Especially</em> if it seems like you're going up higher
and higher. If you are higher than the whole castle ought to be,
<em>stop</em> and wait for search parties. Otherwise we shall see
you again four months later and you will be five months older and
dressed in a loincloth and covered in snow and <em>that's if you
stay inside the castle.</em>"</p>
<p>"Understood," said Harry, swallowing hard. "Um, shouldn't you
tell students all that sort of stuff right away?"</p>
<p>Penelope sighed. "What, <em>all</em> of it? That would take
weeks. You'll pick it up as you go along." She turned to go,
followed by the other students. "If I don't see you at breakfast in
thirty minutes, Potter, I'll start the search."</p>
<p>Once everyone was gone, Harry attached the note to his bed -
he'd already written it and all the other notes, working in his
cavern level before everyone else woke up. Then he carefully
reached inside the Quietus field and pulled the Cloak of
Invisibility off Harry-1's still-sleeping form.</p>
<p>And just for the sake of mischief, Harry put the Cloak into
Harry-1's pouch, knowing it would thereby already be in his
own.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"I can see that the message is passed on to Cornelion
Flubberwalt," said the painting of a man with aristocratic airs
and, in fact, a perfectly normal nose. "But might I ask where it
came from <em>originally?</em> "</p>
<p>Harry shrugged with artful helplessness. "I was told that it was
spoken by a hollow voice that belled forth from a gap within the
air itself, a gap that opened upon a fiery abyss."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"Hey!" Hermione said in tones of indignation from her place on
the other side of the breakfast table. "That's <em>everyone's</em>
dessert! You can't just take one whole pie and put it in your
pouch!"</p>
<p>"I'm not taking one pie, I'm taking two. Sorry everyone, gotta
run now!" Harry ignored the cries of outrage and left the Great
Hall. He needed to arrive at Herbology class a little early.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Professor Sprout eyed him sharply. "And how do <em>you</em> know
what the Slytherins are planning?"</p>
<p>"I can't name my source," Harry said. "In fact I have to ask you
to pretend that this conversation never happened. Just act like you
happened across them naturally while you were on an errand, or
something. I'll run on ahead as soon as Herbology gets out. I think
I can distract the Slytherins until you get there. I'm not easy to
scare or bully, and I don't think they'll dare to seriously hurt
the Boy-Who-Lived. Though... I'm not asking you to run in the
hallways, but I would appreciate it if you didn't dawdle along the
way."</p>
<p>Professor Sprout looked at him for a long moment, then her
expression softened. "Please be careful with yourself, Harry
Potter. And... thank you."</p>
<p>"Just be sure not to be late," Harry said. "And remember, when
you get there, you weren't expecting to see me and this
conversation never happened."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>It was horrible, watching himself yank Neville out of the circle
of Slytherins. Neville had been right, he'd used too much force,
way too much force.</p>
<p>"Hello," Harry Potter said coldly. "I'm the Boy-Who-Lived."</p>
<p>Eight first-year boys, mostly the same height. One of them had a
scar on his forehead and he wasn't acting like the others.</p>
<p><em>Oh wad some power the giftie gie us<br>

And foolish notion -</em></p>
<p>Professor McGonagall was right. The Sorting Hat was right. It
was clear once you saw it from the outside.</p>
<p>There was something wrong with Harry Potter.</p>

<p>Thursday.</p>
<p>If you wanted to be specific, 7:24am on Thursday morning.</p>
<p>Harry was sitting on his bed, a textbook lying limp in his
motionless hands.</p>
<p>Harry had just had an idea for a <em>truly brilliant</em>
experimental test.</p>
<p>It would mean waiting an extra hour for breakfast, but that was
why he had cereal bars. No, this idea absolutely positively had to
be tested right away, immediately, now.</p>
<p>Harry set the textbook aside, leapt out of bed, raced around his
bed, yanked out the cavern level of his trunk, ran down the stairs,
and started moving boxes of books around. (He really needed to
unpack and get bookcases at some point but he was in the middle of
his textbook reading contest with Hermione and falling behind so he
hadn't had time.)</p>
<p>Harry found the book he wanted and raced back upstairs.</p>
<p>The other boys were getting ready to go down to breakfast in the
Great Hall and start the day.</p>
<p>"Excuse me can you do something for me?" said Harry. He was
flipping through the book's index as he spoke, found the page with
the first ten thousand primes, flipped to that page, and thrust the
book at Anthony Goldstein. "Pick two three-digit numbers from this
list. Don't tell me what they are. Just multiply them together and
tell me the product. Oh, and can you do the calculation twice to
double-check? Please make really sure you've got the right answer,
I'm not sure what's going to happen to me or the universe if you
make a multiplication error."</p>
<p>It said a lot about what life in that dorm had been like over
the past few days that Anthony didn't even bother saying anything
like "Why'd you suddenly flip out?" or "That seems really weird,
what are your reasons for asking?" or "What do you mean, you're not
sure what's going to happen to the universe?"</p>
<p>Anthony wordlessly accepted the book and took out a parchment
and quill. Harry spun around and shut his eyes, making sure not to
see anything, dancing back and forth and bouncing up and down with
impatience. He got a pad of paper and a mechanical pencil and got
ready to write.</p>
<p>"Okay," Anthony said, "One hundred and eighty-one thousand, four
hundred and twenty-nine."</p>
<p>Harry wrote down 181,429. He repeated what he'd just written
down, and Anthony confirmed it.</p>
<p>Then Harry raced back down into the cavern level of his trunk,
glanced at his watch (the watch said 4:28 which meant 7:28) and
then shut his eyes.</p>
<p>Around thirty seconds later, Harry heard the sound of steps,
followed by the sound of the cavern level of the trunk sliding
shut. (Harry wasn't worried about suffocating. An automatic
Air-Freshening Charm was part of what you got if you were willing
to buy a really good trunk. Wasn't magic wonderful, it didn't have
to worry about electric bills.)</p>
<p>And when Harry opened his eyes, he saw just what he'd been
hoping to see, a folded piece of paper left on the floor, the gift
of his future self.</p>
<p>Call that piece of paper "Paper-2".</p>
<p>Harry tore a piece of paper off his pad.</p>
<p>Call that "Paper-1". It was, of course, the same piece of paper.
You could even see, if you looked closely, that the ragged edges
matched.</p>
<p>Harry reviewed in his mind the algorithm that he would
follow.</p>
<p>If Harry opened up Paper-2 and it was blank, then he would write
"101 x 101" down on Paper-1, fold it up, study for an hour, go back
in time, drop off Paper-1 (which would thereby become Paper-2), and
head on up out of the cavern level to join his dorm mates for
breakfast.</p>
<p>If Harry opened up Paper-2 and it had two numbers written on it,
Harry would multiply those numbers together.</p>
<p>If their product equaled 181,429, Harry would write down those
two numbers on Paper-1 and send Paper-1 back in time.</p>
<p>Otherwise Harry would add 2 to the number on the right and write
down the new pair of numbers on Paper-1. Unless that made the
number on the right greater than 997, in which case Harry would add
2 to the number on the left and write down 101 on the right.</p>
<p>And if Paper-2 said 997 x 997, Harry would leave Paper-1
blank.</p>
<p>Which meant that the only possible <em>stable</em> time loop was
the one in which Paper-2 contained the two prime factors of
181,429.</p>
<p>If this worked, Harry could use it to recover any sort of answer
that was easy to check but hard to find. He wouldn't have
<em>just</em> shown that P=NP once you had a Time-Turner, this
trick was <em>more general</em> than that. Harry could use it to
find the combinations on combination locks, or passwords of every
sort. Maybe even find the entrance to Slytherin's Chamber of
Secrets, if Harry could figure out some systematic way of
describing all the locations in Hogwarts. It would be an awesome
cheat even by Harry's standards of cheating.</p>
<p>Harry took Paper-2 in his trembling hand, and unfolded it.</p>
<p>Paper-2 said in slightly shaky handwriting:</p>
<p>DO NOT MESS WITH TIME</p>
<p>Harry wrote down "DO NOT MESS WITH TIME" on Paper-1 in slightly
shaky handwriting, folded it neatly, and resolved not to do any
more truly brilliant experiments on Time until he was at least
fifteen years old.</p>
<p>To the best of Harry's knowledge, that had been the scariest
experimental result in the entire history of science.</p>
<p>It had been somewhat difficult for Harry to focus on reading his
textbook for the next hour.</p>
<p>That was how Harry's Thursday started.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Thursday.</p>
<p>If you wanted to be specific, 3:32pm on Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p>Harry and all the other boys in the first year were outside on a
grassy field with Madam Hooch, standing next to the Hogwarts supply
of broomsticks. The girls would be learning to fly separately.
Apparently, for some reason, girls didn't want to learn how to fly
on broomsticks in the presence of boys.</p>
<p>Harry had been a little wobbly all day long. He just couldn't
seem to stop wondering how that <em>particular</em> stable time
loop had been selected out of what was, in retrospect, a rather
large space of possibilities.</p>
<p>Also: seriously, <em>broomsticks?</em> He was going to fly on,
basically, a line segment? Wasn't that pretty much the single most
unstable shape you could possibly find, short of attempting to hold
on to a point marble? Who'd selected <em>that</em> design for a
flying device, out of all the possibilities? Harry had been hoping
that it was just a figure of speech, but no, they were standing in
front of what looked for all the world like ordinary wooden kitchen
broomsticks. Had someone just gotten stuck on the idea of
broomsticks and failed to consider anything else? It had to be.
There was no way that the <em>optimal</em> designs for cleaning
kitchens and flying would happen to coincide if you worked them out
from scratch.</p>
<p>It was a clear day with a bright blue sky and a brilliant sun
that was just begging to get in your eyes and make it impossible to
see, if you were trying to fly around the sky. The ground was nice
and dry, smelling positively baked, and somehow felt very, very
hard under Harry's shoes.</p>
<p>Harry kept reminding himself that the lowest common denominator
of eleven-year-olds was expected to learn this and it couldn't be
that hard.</p>
<p>"Stick out your right hand over the broom, or left hand if
you're left-handed," called Madam Hooch. "And say, UP!"</p>
<p>"UP!" everyone shouted.</p>
<p>The broomstick leapt eagerly into Harry's hand.</p>
<p>Which put him at the head of the class, for once. Apparently
saying "UP!" was a lot more difficult than it looked, and most of
the broomsticks were rolling around on the ground or trying to inch
away from their would-be riders.</p>
<p>(Of course Harry would have bet money that Hermione had done at
least as well when it came her own turn to try, earlier in the day.
There couldn't possibly be anything <em>he</em> could master on the
first try which would baffle Hermione, and if there <em>was</em>
and it turned out to be <em>broomstick riding</em> instead of
anything intellectual, Harry would just die.)</p>
<p>It took a while for everyone to get a broomstick in front of
them. Madam Hooch showed them how to mount and then walked around
the field, correcting grips and stances. Apparently even among the
few children who'd been allowed to fly at home, they hadn't been
taught to do it correctly.</p>
<p>Madam Hooch surveyed the field of boys, and nodded. "Now, when I
blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard."</p>
<p>Harry swallowed hard, trying to quell the queasy feeling in his
stomach.</p>
<p>"Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come
straight back down by leaning forwards slightly. On my whistle -
three - two -"</p>
<p>One of the brooms shot skyward, accompanied by a young boy's
screams - of horror, not delight. The boy was spinning at an awful
rate as he ascended, they only got glimpses of his white face -</p>
<p>As though in slow motion, Harry was leaping back off his own
broomstick and scrabbling for his wand, though he didn't really
know what he planned to do with it, he'd had exactly two sessions
of Charms and the last one <em>had</em> been the Hover Charm but
Harry had only been able to cast the spell successfully one time
out of three and he certainly couldn't levitate whole people -</p>
<p><em>If there is any hidden power in me, let it reveal itself
NOW!</em></p>
<p>"Come back, boy!" shouted Madam Hooch (which had to be the most
unhelpful instruction imaginable for dealing with an out-of-control
broomstick, from a <em>flying instructor</em>, and a fully
automatic section of Harry's brain added Madam Hooch to his tally
of fools).</p>
<p>And the boy was thrown off the broomstick.</p>
<p>He seemed to move very slowly through the air, at first.</p>
<p>"<em>Wingardium Leviosa!</em> " screamed Harry.</p>
<p>The spell failed. He could feel it fail.</p>
<p>There was a THUD and a distant cracking sound, and the boy lay
facedown on the grass in a heap.</p>
<p>Harry sheathed his wand and raced forwards at full speed. He
arrived at the boy's side at the same time as Madam Hooch, and
Harry reached into his pouch and tried to recall oh god what was
the name never mind he'd just try "Healer's Pack!" and it popped up
into his hand and -</p>
<p>"Broken wrist," Madam Hooch said. "Calm down, boy, he just has a
broken wrist!"</p>
<p>There was a sort of mental lurch as Harry's mind snapped out of
Panic Mode.</p>
<p>The Emergency Healing Pack Plus lay open in front of him, and
there was a syringe of liquid fire in Harry's hand, which would
have kept the boy's brain oxygenated if he'd managed to snap his
neck.</p>
<p>"Ah..." Harry said in a rather wavering sort of voice. His heart
was pounding so loudly that he almost couldn't hear himself panting
for breath. "Broken bone... right... Setting String?"</p>
<p>"That's for emergencies only," snapped Madam Hooch. "Put it
away, he's fine." She leaned over the boy, offering him a hand.
"Come on, boy, it's all right, up you get!"</p>
<p>"You're not seriously going to make him ride the broomstick
again?" Harry said in horror.</p>
<p>Madam Hooch sent Harry a glare. "Of course not!" She pulled the
boy to his feet using his good arm - Harry saw with a shock that it
was Neville Longbottom <em>again,</em> what was <em>with</em> him?
- and she turned to all the watching children. "None of you is to
move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those
brooms where they are or you'll be out of Hogwarts before you can
say 'Quidditch.' Come on, dear."</p>
<p>And Madam Hooch walked off with Neville, who was clutching his
wrist and trying to control his sniffles.</p>
<p>When they were out of earshot, one of the Slytherins started
giggling.</p>
<p>That set off the others.</p>
<p>Harry turned and looked at them. It seemed like a good time to
memorise some faces.</p>
<p>And Harry saw that Draco was strolling towards him, accompanied
by Mr. Crabbe and Mr. Goyle. Mr. Crabbe wasn't smiling. Mr. Goyle
decidedly was. Draco himself was wearing a very controlled face
that twitched occasionally, from which Harry inferred that Draco
thought it was hilarious but saw no political advantage to be
gained by laughing about it now instead of in the Slytherin
dungeons afterwards.</p>
<p>"Well, Potter," Draco said in a low voice that didn't carry,
still with that very controlled face that was twitching
occasionally, "Just wanted to say, when you take advantage of
emergencies to demonstrate leadership, you want to look like you're
in total control of the situation, rather than, say, going into a
complete panic." Mr. Goyle giggled, and Draco shot him a quelling
look. "But you probably scored a few points anyway. You need any
help stowing that healer's kit?"</p>
<p>Harry turned to look at the Healing Pack, which got his own face
turned away from Draco. "I think I'm fine," Harry said. He put the
syringe back in its place, redid the latches, and stood up.</p>
<p>Ernie Macmillan arrived just as Harry was feeding the pack back
into his mokeskin pouch.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Harry Potter, on behalf of Hufflepuff," Ernie
Macmillan said formally. "It was a good try and a good
thought."</p>
<p>"A good thought indeed," drawled Draco. "Why didn't anyone in
Hufflepuff have their wands out? Maybe if you'd <em>all</em> helped
instead of just Potter, you could've caught him. I thought
Hufflepuffs were supposed to stick together?"</p>
<p>Ernie looked like he was torn between getting angry and wanting
to die of shame. "We didn't think of it in time -"</p>
<p>"Ah," said Draco, "didn't <em>think</em> of it, I guess that's
why it's better to have one Ravenclaw as a friend than all of
Hufflepuff."</p>
<p>Oh, hell, how was Harry supposed to juggle this one... "You're
not helping," Harry said in a mild tone. Hoping Draco would
interpret that as <em>you're interfering with my plans, please shut
up.</em></p>
<p>"Hey, what's this?" said Mr. Goyle. He stooped to the grass and
picked up something around the size of a large marble, a glass ball
that seemed to be filled with a swirling white mist.</p>
<p>Ernie blinked. "Neville's Remembrall!"</p>
<p>"What's a Remembrall?" asked Harry.</p>
<p>"It turns red if you've forgotten something," Ernie said. "It
doesn't tell you what you forgot, though. Give it here, please, and
I'll hand it back to Neville later." Ernie held out his hand.</p>
<p>A sudden grin flashed across Mr. Goyle's face and he spun around
and raced away.</p>
<p>Ernie stood still for a moment in surprise, and then shouted
"Hey!" and ran after Mr. Goyle.</p>
<p>And Mr. Goyle grabbed a broomstick, hopped on with one smooth
motion and took to the air.</p>
<p>Harry's jaw dropped. Hadn't Madam Hooch said that would get him
<em>expelled?</em></p>
<p><em>"That idiot!</em> " Draco hissed. He opened his mouth to
shout -</p>
<p>"<em>Hey!</em> " shouted Ernie. "That's Neville's! <em>Give it
back!</em> "</p>
<p>The Slytherins started cheering and hooting.</p>
<p>Draco's mouth snapped shut. Harry caught the sudden look of
indecision on his face.</p>
<p>"Draco," Harry said in a low tone, "if you don't order that
idiot back on the ground, the teacher's going to get back and
-"</p>
<p>"<em>Come and get it, Hufflepuffle!</em> " shouted Mr. Goyle,
and a great cheer went up from the Slytherins.</p>
<p>"I <em>can't!</em> " whispered Draco. "Everyone in Slytherin
would think I'm <em>weak!</em> "</p>
<p>"And if Mr. Goyle gets expelled," hissed Harry, "your
<em>father</em> is going to think you're a <em>moron!</em> "</p>
<p>Draco's face twisted in agony.</p>
<p>At that moment -</p>
<p>"Hey, <em>Slytherslime</em>," shouted Ernie, "didn't anyone ever
tell you that Hufflepuffs stick together? <em>Wands out,
Hufflepuff!</em> "</p>
<p>And there were suddenly a whole lot of wands pointed in Mr.
Goyle's direction.</p>
<p>Three seconds later -</p>
<p>"<em>Wands out, Slytherin!</em> " said around five different
Slytherins.</p>
<p>And there were a whole lot of wands pointed in Hufflepuff's
direction.</p>
<p>Two seconds later -</p>
<p>"<em>Wands out, Gryffindor!</em> "</p>
<p>"<em>Do something, Potter!</em> " whispered Draco. "<em>I can't
be the one to stop this it has to be you! I'll owe you a favour
just think of something aren't you supposed to be
brilliant?</em> "</p>
<p>In around five and a half seconds, realised Harry, someone was
going to cast the Sumerian Simple Strike Hex and by the time it was
over and the teachers were done expelling people the only boys left
in his year would be Ravenclaws.</p>
<p>"<em>Wands out, Ravenclaw!</em> " shouted Michael Corner who was
apparently feeling left out of the disaster.</p>
<p>"<em>GREGORY GOYLE!"</em> screamed Harry<em>. "I challenge you
to a contest for possession of Neville's Remembrall!"</em></p>
<p>There was a sudden pause.</p>
<p>"Oh, really?" said Draco in the loudest drawl Harry had ever
heard. "That sounds interesting. What sort of contest, Potter?"</p>
<p>Er...</p>
<p>"Contest" had been as far as Harry's inspiration had gotten.
What sort of contest, he couldn't say "chess" because Draco
wouldn't be able to accept without it looking strange, he couldn't
say "arm-wrestling" because Mr. Goyle would crush him -</p>
<p>"How about this?" Harry said loudly. "Gregory Goyle and I stand
apart from each other, and no one else is allowed to come near
either of us. We don't use our wands and neither does anyone else.
I don't move from where I'm standing, and neither does he. And if I
can get my hands on Neville's Remembrall, then Gregory Goyle
relinquishes all claim to that Remembrall he's holding and gives it
to me."</p>
<p>There was another pause as people's looks of relief transmuted
to confusion.</p>
<p>"Hah, Potter!" said Draco loudly. "I'd like to see you do
<em>that!</em> Mr. Goyle accepts!"</p>
<p>"It's on!" said Harry.</p>
<p>"Potter, <em>what?</em> " whispered Draco, which he somehow did
without moving his lips.</p>
<p>Harry didn't know how to answer without moving his.</p>
<p>People were putting their wands away, and Mr. Goyle swooped
gracefully to the ground, looking rather confused. Some Hufflepuffs
started over towards Mr. Goyle, but Harry shot them a desperately
pleading look and they backed off.</p>
<p>Harry walked toward Mr. Goyle and stopped when he was a few
paces away, far enough apart that they couldn't reach each
other.</p>
<p>Slowly, deliberately, Harry sheathed his wand.</p>
<p>Everyone else backed away.</p>
<p>Harry swallowed. He knew in broad outline what he
<em>wanted</em> to do, but it had to be done in such a way that no
one understood <em>what</em> he'd done -</p>
<p>"All right," Harry said loudly. "And now..." He took a deep
breath and raised one hand, fingers ready to snap. There were gasps
from anyone who'd heard about the pies, which was practically
everyone. "<em>I call upon the insanity of Hogwarts! Happy happy
boom boom swamp swamp swamp!</em> " And Harry snapped his
fingers.</p>
<p>A lot of people flinched.</p>
<p>And nothing happened.</p>
<p>Harry let the silence stretch on for a while, developing,
until...</p>
<p>"Um," someone said. "Is that it?"</p>
<p>Harry looked at the boy who'd spoken. "Look in front of you. You
see that patch of ground that looks barren, without any grass on
it?"</p>
<p>"Um, yeah," said the boy, a Gryffindor (Dean something?).</p>
<p>"Dig it up."</p>
<p>Now Harry was getting a lot of strange looks.</p>
<p>"Er, why?" said Dean something.</p>
<p>"Just do it," said Terry Boot in a weary voice. "No point asking
why, trust me on this one."</p>
<p>Dean something kneeled down and began to scoop away dirt.</p>
<p>After a minute or so, Dean stood up again. "There's nothing
there," Dean said.</p>
<p>Huh. Harry had been planning to go back in time and bury a
treasure map that would lead to another treasure map that would
lead to Neville's Remembrall which he would put there after getting
it back from Mr. Goyle...</p>
<p>Then Harry realised there was a much simpler way which didn't
threaten the secret of Time-Turners quite as much.</p>
<p>"Thanks, Dean!" Harry said loudly. "Ernie, would you look around
on the ground where Neville fell and see if you can find Neville's
Remembrall?"</p>
<p>People looked even more confused.</p>
<p>"Just do it," said Terry Boot. "He'll keep trying until
something works, and the scary thing is that -"</p>
<p>"<em>Merlin!</em> " gasped Ernie. He was holding up Neville's
Remembrall. "It's <em>here!</em> Right where he fell!"</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " cried Mr. Goyle. He looked down and saw...</p>
<p>...that he was still holding Neville's Remembrall.</p>
<p>There was a rather long pause.</p>
<p>"Er," said Dean something, "that's not possible, is it?"</p>
<p>"It's a plot hole," said Harry. "I made myself weird enough to
distract the universe for a moment and it forgot that Goyle had
already picked up the Remembrall."</p>
<p>"No, wait, I mean, that's <em>totally</em> not possible -"</p>
<p>"Excuse me, are we all standing around here waiting to go flying
on broomsticks? Yes we are. So shut up. Anyway, once I get my hands
on Neville's Remembrall, the contest is over and Gregory Goyle has
to relinquish all claim to the Remembrall he's holding and give it
to me. Those were the terms, remember?" Harry stretched out a hand
and beckoned Ernie. "Just roll it over here, since no one's
supposed to get close to me, okay?"</p>
<p>"Hold on!" shouted a Slytherin - Blaise Zabini, Harry wasn't
likely to forget that name. "How do we know that's Neville's
Remembrall? You could've just dropped <em>another</em> Remembrall
there -"</p>
<p>"The Slytherin is strong with this one," Harry said, smiling.
"But you have my word that the one Ernie's holding is Neville's. No
comment about the one Gregory Goyle's holding."</p>
<p>Zabini spun to Draco. "<em>Malfoy!</em> You're not just going to
let him get away with that -"</p>
<p>"Shut up, you," rumbled Mr. Crabbe, standing behind Draco. "Mr.
Malfoy doesn't need <em>you</em> to tell him what to do!"</p>
<p><em>Good</em> minion.</p>
<p>"My bet was with Draco, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of
Malfoy," Harry said. "Not with you, Zabini. I have done what Mr.
Malfoy said he'd like to see me do, and as for the judgment of the
bet, I leave that up to Mr. Malfoy." Harry inclined his head
towards Draco and raised his eyebrows slightly. That ought to allow
Draco to save enough face.</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>"You promise that actually <em>is</em> Neville's Remembrall?"
Draco said.</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said. "That's the one that'll go back to Neville
and it was his originally. And the one Gregory Goyle's holding goes
to me."</p>
<p>Draco nodded, looking decisive. "I won't question the word of
the Noble House of Potter, then, no matter how strange that all
was. And the Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy keeps its word
as well. Mr. Goyle, give that to Mr. Potter -"</p>
<p>"Hey!" Zabini said. "He hasn't won <em>yet</em>, he hasn't got
his hands on -"</p>
<p>"Catch, Harry!" said Ernie, and he tossed the Remembrall.</p>
<p>Harry easily snapped the Remembrall out of the air, he'd always
had good reflexes that way. "There," said Harry, "I win..."</p>
<p>Harry trailed off. All conversation stopped.</p>
<p>The Remembrall was glowing bright red in his hand, blazing like
a miniature sun that cast shadows on the ground in broad
daylight.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Thursday.</p>
<p>If you wanted to be specific, 5:09pm on Thursday afternoon, in
Professor McGonagall's office, after flying classes. (With an extra
hour for Harry slipped in between.)</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall sitting on her stool. Harry in the hot seat
in front of her desk.</p>
<p>"Professor," Harry said tightly, "Slytherin was pointing their
wands at Hufflepuff, Gryffindor was pointing their wands at
Slytherin, some <em>idiot</em> called wands out in Ravenclaw, and I
had maybe five seconds to keep the whole thing from blowing
sky-high! It was all I could think of!"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall's face was pinched and angry. "<em>You are
not to use the Time-Turner in that fashion, Mr. Potter!</em> Is the
concept of secrecy not something that you understand?"</p>
<p>"They don't <em>know</em> how I did it! They just think I can do
really weird things by snapping my fingers! I've done other weird
stuff that can't be done with Time-Turners even, and I'll do
<em>more</em> stuff like that, and <em>this</em> case won't even
stand out! I <em>had to do it,</em> Professor!"</p>
<p>"You did <em>not</em> have to do it!" snapped Professor
McGonagall. "All you needed to do was get this <em>anonymous
Slytherin</em> back on the ground and the wands put away! You could
have challenged him to a game of Exploding Snap but no, you had to
use the Time-Turner in a flagrant and unnecessary manner!"</p>
<p>"It was all I could think of! I don't even know what Exploding
Snap <em>is,</em> they wouldn't have accepted a game of chess and
if I'd picked arm-wresting I would have lost!"</p>
<p>"<em>Then you should have picked wrestling!</em> "</p>
<p>Harry blinked. "But then I'd have <em>lost</em> -"</p>
<p>Harry stopped.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall was looking <em>very</em> angry.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Professor McGonagall," Harry said in a small voice.
"I honestly didn't think of that, and you're right, I should have,
it would have been brilliant if I had, but I just didn't think of
that at all..."</p>
<p>Harry's voice trailed off. It was suddenly apparent to him that
he'd had a <em>lot</em> of other options. He could have asked
<em>Draco</em> to suggest something, he could have asked the
crowd... his use of the Time-Turner <em>had</em> been flagrant and
unnecessary. There had been a giant space of possibilities, why had
he picked <em>that</em> one?</p>
<p>Because he'd seen a way to <em>win.</em> Win possession of an
unimportant trinket that the teachers would've taken back from Mr.
Goyle anyway.</p>
<p>Intent to win. That was what had gotten him.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," Harry said again. "For my pride and my
stupidity."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall wiped a hand across her forehead. Some of
her anger seemed to dissipate. But her voice still came out very
hard. "One more display like that, Mr. Potter, and you will be
returning that Time-Turner. Do I make myself very clear?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said. "I understand and I'm sorry."</p>
<p>"Then, Mr. Potter, you will be allowed to retain the Time-Turner
for now. And considering the size of the debacle you did, in fact,
avert, I will not deduct any points from Ravenclaw."</p>
<p><em>Plus you couldn't explain why you'd deducted the
points.</em> But Harry wasn't dumb enough to say that out loud.</p>
<p>"More importantly, why did the Remembrall go off like that?"
Harry said. "Does it mean I've been Obliviated?"</p>
<p>"That puzzles me as well," Professor McGonagall said slowly. "If
it were that simple, I would think that the courts would use
Remembralls, and they do not. I shall look into it, Mr. Potter."
She sighed. "You can go now."</p>
<p>Harry started to get up from his chair, then halted. "Um, sorry,
I did have something else I wanted to tell you -"</p>
<p>You could hardly see the flinch. "What is it, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>"It's about Professor Quirrell -"</p>
<p>"I'm sure, Mr. Potter, that it is nothing of importance."
Professor McGonagall spoke the words in a great rush. "Surely you
heard the Headmaster tell the students that you were not to bother
us with any unimportant complaints about the Defence
Professor?"</p>
<p>Harry was rather confused. "But this could <em>be</em>
important, yesterday I got this sudden sense of doom when -"</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter! I have a sense of doom as well! And my sense of
doom is suggesting that <em>you must not finish that
sentence!</em> "</p>
<p>Harry's mouth gaped open. Professor McGonagall had succeeded;
Harry was speechless.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter," said Professor McGonagall, "if you have discovered
anything that seems interesting about Professor Quirrell, please
feel free not to share it with me or anyone else. Now I think
you've taken up enough of my valuable time -"</p>
<p>"<em>This isn't like you!</em> " Harry burst out. "I'm sorry but
that just seems <em>unbelievably</em> irresponsible! From what I've
heard there's some kind of jinx on the Defence position, and if you
already <em>know</em> something's going to go wrong, I'd think
you'd all be on your toes -"</p>
<p>"Go <em>wrong</em>, Mr. Potter? <em>I certainly hope not.</em>"
Professor McGonagall's face was expressionless. "After Professor
Blake was caught in a closet with no fewer than three fifth-year
Slytherins last February, and a year before that, Professor Summers
failed so completely as an educator that her students thought a
boggart was a kind of furniture, it would be <em>catastrophic</em>
if some problem with the extraordinarily competent Professor
Quirrell came to my attention now, and I daresay most of our
students would fail their Defence O.W.L.s and N.E.W.T.s."</p>
<p>"I see," Harry said slowly, taking it all in. "So in other
words, whatever's wrong with Professor Quirrell, you desperately
don't want to know about it until the end of the school year. And
since it's currently September, he could assassinate the Prime
Minister on live television and get away with it so far as you're
concerned."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall gazed at him unblinkingly. "I am certain
that I could never be heard endorsing such a statement, Mr. Potter.
At Hogwarts we strive to be proactive with respect to
<em>anything</em> that threatens the educational attainment of our
students."</p>
<p><em>Such as first-year Ravenclaws who can't keep their mouths
shut.</em> "I believe I understand you completely, Professor
McGonagall."</p>
<p>"Oh, I doubt that, Mr. Potter. I doubt that very much."
Professor McGonagall leaned forward, her face tightening again.
"Since you and I have already discussed matters far more sensitive
than these, I shall speak frankly. You, and you alone, have
reported this mysterious sense of doom. You, and you alone, are a
chaos magnet the likes of which I have never seen. After our little
shopping trip to Diagon Alley, and <em>then</em> the Sorting Hat,
and then <em>today's</em> little episode, I can well foresee that I
am fated to sit in the Headmaster's office and hear some hilarious
tale about Professor Quirrell in which you and you alone play a
starring role, after which there will be no choice but to fire him.
I am already resigned to it, Mr. Potter. And if this sad event
takes place any earlier than the Ides of May, I will string you up
by the gates of Hogwarts with your own intestines and pour fire
beetles into your nose. <em>Now</em> do you understand me
completely?"</p>
<p>Harry nodded, his eyes very wide. Then, after a second, "What do
I get if I can make it happen on the last day of the school
year?"</p>
<p>"<em>Get out of my office!</em> "</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Thursday.</p>
<p>There must have been something about Thursdays in Hogwarts.</p>
<p>It was 5:32pm on Thursday afternoon, and Harry was standing next
to Professor Flitwick, in front of the great stone gargoyle that
guarded the entrance to the Headmaster's office.</p>
<p>No sooner had he made it back from Professor McGonagall's office
to the Ravenclaw study rooms than one of the students told him to
report to Professor Flitwick's office, and there Harry had learned
that Dumbledore wanted to speak to him.</p>
<p>Harry, feeling rather apprehensive, had asked Professor Flitwick
if the Headmaster had said what this was about.</p>
<p>Professor Flitwick had shrugged in a helpless sort of way.</p>
<p>Apparently Dumbledore had said that Harry was far too young to
invoke the words of power and madness.</p>
<p><em>Happy happy boom boom swamp swamp swamp?</em> Harry had
thought but not said aloud.</p>
<p>"Please don't worry too much, Mr. Potter," squeaked Professor
Flitwick from somewhere around Harry's shoulder level. (Harry was
grateful for Professor Flitwick's gigantic puffy beard, it was hard
getting used to a Professor who was not only shorter than him but
spoke in a higher-pitched voice.) "Headmaster Dumbledore may seem a
little odd, or a lot odd, or even extremely odd, but he has never
hurt a student in the slightest, and I don't believe he ever will."
Professor Flitwick gave Harry an encouraging smile. "Just keep that
in mind at all times and you'll be sure not to panic!"</p>
<p>This was not helping.</p>
<p>"Good luck!" squeaked Professor Flitwick, and leaned over to the
gargoyle and said something that Harry somehow failed to hear at
all. (Of course, the password wouldn't be much good if you could
hear someone saying it.) And the stone gargoyle walked aside with a
very natural and ordinary movement that Harry found rather
shocking, since the gargoyle still looked like solid, immovable
stone the whole time.</p>
<p>Behind the gargoyle was a set of slowly revolving spiral stairs.
There was something disturbingly hypnotic about it, and even more
disturbing was that <em>revolving</em> the spiral ought not to take
you anywhere.</p>
<p>"Up you go!" squeaked Flitwick.</p>
<p>Harry rather nervously stepped onto the spiral, and found
himself, for some reason that his brain couldn't seem to visualise
at all, moving upwards.</p>
<p>The gargoyle thudded back into place behind him, and the spiral
stairs kept turning and Harry kept being higher up, and after a
rather dizzying time, Harry found himself in front of an oak door
with a brass griffin knocker.</p>
<p>Harry reached out and turned the doorknob.</p>
<p>The door swung open.</p>
<p>And Harry saw the most interesting room he'd ever seen in his
life.</p>
<p>There were tiny metal mechanisms that whirred or ticked or
slowly changed shape or emitted little puffs of smoke. There were
dozens of mysterious fluids in dozens of oddly shaped containers,
all bubbling, boiling, oozing, changing color, or forming into
interesting shapes that vanished half a second after you saw them.
There were things that looked like clocks with many hands,
inscribed with numbers or in unrecognisable languages. There was a
bracelet bearing a lenticular crystal that sparkled with a thousand
colors, and a bird perched atop a golden platform, and a wooden cup
filled with what looked like blood, and a statue of a falcon
encrusted in black enamel. The wall was all hung with pictures of
people sleeping, and the Sorting Hat was casually poised on a
hatrack that was also holding two umbrellas and three red slippers
for left feet.</p>
<p>In the midst of all the chaos was a clean black oaken desk.
Before the desk was an oaken stool. And behind the desk was a
well-cushioned throne containing Albus Percival Wulfric Brian
Dumbledore, who was adorned with a long silver beard, a hat like a
squashed giant mushroom, and what looked to Muggle eyes like three
layers of bright pink pyjamas.</p>
<p>Dumbledore was smiling, and his bright eyes twinkled with a mad
intensity.</p>
<p>With some trepidation, Harry seated himself in front of the
desk. The door swung shut behind him with a loud
<em>thunk.</em></p>
<p>"Hello, Harry," said Dumbledore.</p>
<p>"Hello, Headmaster," Harry replied. So they were on a first-name
basis? Would Dumbledore now say to call him -</p>
<p>"Please, Harry!" said Dumbledore. "Headmaster sounds so formal.
Just call me Heh for short."</p>
<p>"I'll be sure to, Heh," said Harry.</p>
<p>There was a slight pause.</p>
<p>"Do you know," said Dumbledore, "you're the first person who's
ever taken me up on that?"</p>
<p>"Ah..." Harry said. He tried to control his voice despite the
sudden sinking feeling in his stomach. "I'm sorry, I, ah,
Headmaster, you told me to do it so I did -"</p>
<p>"Heh, please!" said Dumbledore cheerfully. "And there's no call
to be so worried, I won't launch you out a window just because you
make one mistake. I'll give you plenty of warnings first, if you're
doing something wrong! Besides, what matters isn't how people talk
to you, it's what they think of you."</p>
<p><em>He's never hurt a student, just keep remembering that and
you'll be sure not to panic.</em></p>
<p>Dumbledore drew forth a small metal case and flipped it open,
showing some small yellow lumps. "Sherbet lemon?" said the
Headmaster.</p>
<p>"Er, no thank you, Heh," said Harry. <em>Does slipping a student
LSD count as hurting them, or does that fall into the category of
harmless fun?</em> "You, um, said something about my being too
young to invoke the words of power and madness?"</p>
<p>"That you most certainly are!" Dumbledore said. "Thankfully the
Words of Power and Madness were lost seven centuries ago and no one
has the slightest idea what they are anymore. It was just a little
remark."</p>
<p>"Ah..." Harry said. He was aware that his mouth was hanging
open. "Why did you call me here, then?"</p>
<p>"<em>Why?</em> " Dumbledore repeated. "Ah, Harry, if I went
around all day asking <em>why</em> I do things, I'd never have time
to get a single thing done! I'm quite a busy person, you know."</p>
<p>Harry nodded, smiling. "Yes, it was a very impressive list.
Headmaster of Hogwarts, Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, and
Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards.
Sorry to ask but I was wondering, is it possible to get more than
six hours if you use more than one Time-Turner? Because it's pretty
impressive if you're doing all that on just thirty hours a
day."</p>
<p>There was another slight pause, during which Harry went on
smiling. He was a little apprehensive, actually a lot apprehensive,
but once it had become clear that Dumbledore was deliberately
messing with him, something within him <em>absolutely refused</em>
to sit and take it like a defenceless lump.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid Time doesn't like being stretched out too much,"
said Dumbledore after the slight pause, "and yet we ourselves seem
to be a little too large for it, and so it's a constant struggle to
fit our lives into Time."</p>
<p>"Indeed," Harry said with grave solemnity. "That's why it's best
to come to our points quickly."</p>
<p>For a moment Harry wondered if he'd gone too far.</p>
<p>Then Dumbledore chuckled. "Straight to the point it shall be."
The Headmaster leaned forwards, tilting his squashed mushroom hat
and brushing his beard against his desk. "Harry, this Monday you
did something that should have been impossible even with a
Time-Turner. Or rather, impossible with <em>only</em> a
Time-Turner. Where did those two pies come from, I wonder?"</p>
<p>A jolt of adrenaline shot through Harry. He'd done that using
the Cloak of Invisibility, the one that had been given him in a
Christmas box along with a note, and that note had said: <em>If
Dumbledore saw a chance to possess one of the Deathly Hallows he
would never let it escape his grasp.</em><em>...</em></p>
<p>"A natural thought," Dumbledore went on, "is that since none of
the first-years present were able to cast such a spell, someone
else was present, and yet unseen. And if no one could see them,
why, it would be easy enough for them to throw the pies. One might
further suspect that since you had a Time-Turner, you were the
invisible one; and that since the spell of Disillusionment is far
beyond your current abilities, you had an invisibility cloak."
Dumbledore smiled conspiratorially. "Am I on the right track so
far, Harry?"</p>
<p>Harry was frozen. He had the feeling that an outright lie would
not at all be wise, and possibly not the least bit helpful, and he
couldn't think of anything else to say.</p>
<p>Dumbledore waved a friendly hand. "Don't worry, Harry, you
haven't done anything wrong. Invisibility cloaks aren't against the
rules - I suppose they're rare enough that no one ever got around
to putting them on the list. But really I was wondering something
else entirely."</p>
<p>"Oh?" Harry said in the most normal voice he could manage.</p>
<p>Dumbledore's eyes shone with enthusiasm. "You see, Harry, after
you've been through a few adventures you tend to catch the hang of
these things. You start to see the pattern, hear the rhythm of the
world. You begin to harbour suspicions <em>before</em> the moment
of revelation. You are the Boy-Who-Lived, and somehow an
invisibility cloak made its way into your hands only four days
after you discovered our magical Britain. Such cloaks are not for
sale in Diagon Alley, but there is <em>one</em> which might find
its own way to a destined wearer. And so I cannot help but wonder
if by some strange chance you have found not just <em>an</em>
invisibility cloak, but <em>the</em> Cloak of Invisibility, one of
the three Deathly Hallows and reputed to hide the wearer from the
gaze of Death himself." Dumbledore's gaze was bright and eager.
"May I see it, Harry?"</p>
<p>Harry swallowed. There was a full flood of adrenaline in his
system now and it was entirely useless, this was the most powerful
wizard in the world and there was no way he could make it out the
door and there was nowhere in Hogwarts for him to hide if he did,
he was about to lose the Cloak that had been passed down through
the Potters for who knew how long -</p>
<p>Slowly Dumbledore leaned back into his high chair. The bright
light had gone out of his eyes, and he looked puzzled and a little
sorrowful. "Harry," said Dumbledore, "if you don't want to, you can
just say no."</p>
<p>"I can?" Harry croaked.</p>
<p>"Yes, Harry," said Dumbledore. His voice sounded sad now, and
worried. "It seems that you're afraid of me, Harry. May I ask what
I've done to earn your distrust?"</p>
<p>Harry swallowed. "Is there some way you can swear a binding
magical oath that you won't take my cloak?"</p>
<p>Dumbledore shook his head slowly. "Unbreakable Vows are not to
be used so lightly. And besides, Harry, if you did not already know
the spell, you would have only my word that the spell was binding.
Yet surely you realise that I do not <em>need</em> your permission
to see the Cloak. I am powerful enough to draw it forth myself,
mokeskin pouch or no." Dumbledore's face was very grave. "But this
I will not do. The Cloak is yours, Harry. I will not seize it from
you. Not even to look at for just a moment, unless you decide to
show it to me. That is a promise and an oath. Should I need to
prohibit you from using it on the school grounds, I will require
you to go to your vault at Gringotts and store it there."</p>
<p>"Ah..." Harry said. He swallowed hard, trying to calm the flood
of adrenaline and think reasonably. He took the mokeskin pouch off
his belt. "If you really <em>don't</em> need my permission... then
you have it." Harry held out the pouch to Dumbledore, and bit down
hard on his lip, sending that signal to himself in case he was
Obliviated afterwards.</p>
<p>The old wizard reached into the pouch, and without saying any
word of retrieval, drew forth the Cloak of Invisibility.</p>
<p>"Ah," breathed Dumbledore. "I was right..." He poured the
shimmering black velvet mesh through his hand. "Centuries old, and
still as perfect as the day it was made. We have lost much of our
art over the years, and now I cannot make such a thing myself, no
one can. I can feel the power of it like an echo in my mind, like a
song forever being sung without anyone to hear it..." The wizard
looked up from the Cloak. "Do not sell it," he said, "do not give
it to anyone as a possession. Think twice before you show it to
anyone, and ponder three times again before you reveal it is a
Deathly Hallow. Treat it with respect, for this is indeed a Thing
of Power."</p>
<p>For a moment Dumbledore's face grew wistful...</p>
<p>...and then he handed the Cloak back to Harry.</p>
<p>Harry put it back in his pouch.</p>
<p>Dumbledore's face was grave once more. "May I ask again, Harry,
how you came to distrust me so?"</p>
<p>Suddenly Harry felt rather ashamed.</p>
<p>"There was a note with the Cloak," Harry said in a small voice.
"It said that you would try to take the Cloak from me, if you knew.
I don't know who left the note, though, I really don't."</p>
<p>"I... see," Dumbledore said slowly. "Well, Harry, I won't impugn
the motives of whoever left you that note. Who knows but that they
themselves may have had the best of good intentions? They did give
you the Cloak, after all."</p>
<p>Harry nodded, impressed by Dumbledore's charity, and abashed at
the sharp contrast with his own attitude.</p>
<p>The old wizard went on. "But you and I are both gamepieces of
the same color, I think. The boy who finally defeated Voldemort,
and the old man who held him off long enough for you to save the
day. I will not hold your caution against you, Harry, we must all
do our best to be wise. I will only ask that you think twice and
ponder three times again, the next time someone tells you to
distrust me."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," Harry said. He felt wretched at this point, he'd
just told off Gandalf essentially, and Dumbledore's kindness was
only making him feel worse. "I shouldn't have distrusted you."</p>
<p>"Alas, Harry, in this world..." The old wizard shook his head.
"I cannot even say you were unwise. You did not know me. And in
truth there are some at Hogwarts who you would do well not to
trust. Perhaps even some you call friends."</p>
<p>Harry swallowed. That sounded rather ominous. "Like who?"</p>
<p>Dumbledore stood up from his chair, and began examining one of
his instruments, a dial with eight hands of varying length.</p>
<p>After a few moments, the old wizard spoke again. "He probably
seems to you quite charming," said Dumbledore. "Polite - to you at
least. Well-spoken, maybe even admiring. Always ready with a
helping hand, a favour, a word of advice -"</p>
<p>"Oh, <em>Draco Malfoy!</em> " Harry said, feeling rather
relieved that it wasn't Hermione or something. "Oh no, no no no,
you've got it all wrong, he's not turning me, I'm turning him."</p>
<p>Dumbledore froze where he was peering at the dial. "You're
<em>what?</em> "</p>
<p>"I'm going to turn Draco Malfoy from the Dark Side," Harry said.
"You know, make him a good guy."</p>
<p>Dumbledore straightened and turned to Harry. He was wearing one
of the most astonished expressions Harry had ever seen on anyone,
let alone someone with a long silver beard. "Are you certain," said
the old wizard after a moment, "that he is ready to be redeemed? I
fear that whatever goodness you think you see within him is only
wishful thinking - or worse, a lure, a bait -"</p>
<p>"Er, not likely," Harry said. "I mean if he's trying to disguise
himself as a good guy he's incredibly bad at it. This isn't a
question of Draco coming up to me and being all charming and me
deciding that he must have a hidden core of goodness deep down. I
selected him for redemption specifically because he's the heir to
House Malfoy and if you had to pick one person to redeem, it would
obviously be him."</p>
<p>Dumbledore's left eye twitched. "You intend to sow seeds of love
and kindness in Draco Malfoy's heart because you expect Malfoy's
heir to prove valuable to you?"</p>
<p>"Not just to <em>me!</em> " Harry said indignantly. "To all of
magical Britain, if this works out! <em>And</em> he'll have a
happier and mentally healthier life himself! Look, I don't have
enough time to turn <em>everyone</em> away from the Dark Side and
I've got to ask where the Light can gain the most advantage the
fastest -"</p>
<p>Dumbledore started laughing. Laughing a lot harder than Harry
would expect, almost howling. It seemed positively
<em>undignified.</em> An ancient and powerful wizard ought to
chuckle in deep booming tones, not laugh so hard he was gasping for
breath. Harry had once literally fallen out of his chair while
watching the Marx Brothers movie <em>Duck Soup,</em> and that was
how hard Dumbledore was laughing now.</p>
<p>"It's not <em>that</em> funny," Harry said after a while. He was
starting to worry about Dumbledore's sanity again.</p>
<p>Dumbledore got himself under control again with a visible
effort. "Ah, Harry, one symptom of the disease called wisdom is
that you begin laughing at things that no one else thinks is funny,
because when you're wise, Harry, you start getting the jokes!" The
old wizard wiped tears away from his eyes. "Ah, me. Ah, me. Oft
evil will shall evil mar indeed, in very deed."</p>
<p>Harry's brain took a moment to place the familiar words... "Hey,
that's a <em>Tolkien</em> quote! <em>Gandalf</em> says that!"</p>
<p>"Theoden, actually," said Dumbledore.</p>
<p>"You're <em>Muggleborn?</em> " Harry said in shock.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid not," said Dumbledore, smiling again. "I was born
seventy years before that book was published, dear child. But it
seems that my Muggleborn students tend to think alike in certain
ways. I have accumulated no fewer than twenty copies of <em>The
Lord of the Rings</em> and three sets of Tolkien's entire collected
works, and I treasure every one of them." Dumbledore drew his wand
and held it up and struck a pose. "<em>You cannot pass!</em> How
does that look?"</p>
<p>"Ah," Harry said in something approaching complete brain
shutdown, "I think you're missing a Balrog." And the pink pyjamas
and squashed mushroom hat were not helping in the slightest.</p>
<p>"I see." Dumbledore sighed and glumly sheathed the wand in his
belt. "I fear there have been precious few Balrogs in my life of
late. Nowadays it's all meetings of the Wizengamot where I must try
desperately to prevent any work from getting done, and formal
dinners where foreign politicians compete to see who can be the
most obstinate fool. And being mysterious at people, knowing things
I have no way of knowing, making cryptic statements which can only
be understood in hindsight, and all the other small ways in which
powerful wizards amuse themselves after they have left the part of
the pattern that allows them to be heroes. Speaking of which,
Harry, I have a certain something to give you, something which
belonged to your father."</p>
<p>"You do?" said Harry. "Gosh, who would have figured."</p>
<p>"Yes indeed," said Dumbledore. "I suppose it is a little
predictable, isn't it?" His face turned solemn.
"Nonetheless..."</p>
<p>Dumbledore went back to his desk and sat down, pulling out one
of the drawers as he did so. He reached in using both arms, and,
straining slightly, pulled a rather large and heavy-looking object
out of the drawer, which he then deposited on his oaken desk with a
huge thunk.</p>
<p>"This," Dumbledore said, "was your father's rock."</p>
<p>Harry stared at it. It was light gray, discolored, irregularly
shaped, sharp-edged, and very much a plain old ordinary large rock.
Dumbledore had deposited it so that it rested on the widest
available cross-section, but it still wobbled unstably on his
desk.</p>
<p>Harry looked up. "This is a joke, right?"</p>
<p>"It is not," said Dumbledore, shaking his head and looking very
serious. "I took this from the ruins of James and Lily's home in
Godric's Hollow, where also I found you; and I have kept it from
then until now, against the day when I could give it to you."</p>
<p>In the mixture of hypotheses that served as Harry's model of the
world, Dumbledore's insanity was rapidly rising in probability. But
there <em>was</em> still a substantial amount of probability
allocated to other alternatives... "Um, is it a <em>magical</em>
rock?"</p>
<p>"Not so far as I know," said Dumbledore. "But I advise you with
the greatest possible stringency to keep it close about your person
at all times."</p>
<p>All right. Dumbledore was <em>probably</em> insane but if he
<em>wasn't</em>... well, it would be just too <em>embarrassing</em>
to get in trouble from ignoring the advice of the inscrutable old
wizard. That had to be like #4 on the list of the Top 100 Obvious
Failure Modes.</p>
<p>Harry stepped forward and put his hands on the rock, trying to
find some angle from which to lift it without cutting himself.
"I'll put it in my pouch, then."</p>
<p>Dumbledore frowned. "That may not be close enough to your
person. And what if your mokeskin pouch is lost, or stolen?"</p>
<p>"You think I should just carry a big rock everywhere I go?"</p>
<p>Dumbledore gave Harry a serious look. "That might prove
wise."</p>
<p>"Ah..." Harry said. It looked rather heavy. "I'd think the other
students would tend to ask me questions about that."</p>
<p>"Tell them I ordered you to do it," said Dumbledore. "No one
will question that, since they all think I'm insane." His face was
still perfectly serious.</p>
<p>"Er, to be honest if you go around ordering your students to
carry large rocks I can kind of see why people would think
that."</p>
<p>"Ah, Harry," said Dumbledore. The old wizard gestured, a sweep
of one hand that seemed to take in all the mysterious instruments
around the room. "When we are young we believe that we know
everything, and so we believe that if we see no explanation for
something, then no explanation exists. When we are older we realise
that the whole universe works by a rhythm and a reason, even if we
ourselves do not know it. It is only our own ignorance which
appears to us as insanity."</p>
<p>"Reality is always lawful," said Harry, "even if we don't know
the law."</p>
<p>"Precisely, Harry," said Dumbledore. "To understand this - and I
see that you <em>do</em> understand it - is the essence of
wisdom."</p>
<p>"So... <em>why</em> do I have to carry this rock exactly?"</p>
<p>"I can't think of a reason, actually," said Dumbledore.</p>
<p>"...you can't."</p>
<p>Dumbledore nodded. "But just because I can't think of a reason
doesn't mean there <em>is</em> no reason."</p>
<p>The instruments ticked on.</p>
<p>"Okay," said Harry, "I'm not even sure if I should be saying
this, but that is simply not the correct way to deal with our
admitted ignorance of how the universe works."</p>
<p>"It isn't?" said the old wizard, looking surprised and
disappointed.</p>
<p>Harry had the feeling this conversation was not going to work
out in his favour, but he carried on regardless. "No. I don't even
know if that fallacy has an official name, but if I had to make one
up myself, it would be 'privileging the hypothesis' or something
like that. How can I put this formally... um... suppose you had a
million boxes, and only one of the boxes contained a diamond. And
you had a box full of diamond-detectors, and each diamond-detector
always went off in the presence of a diamond, and went off half the
time on boxes that didn't have a diamond. If you ran twenty
detectors over all the boxes, you'd have, on average, one false
candidate and one true candidate left. And then it would just take
one or two more detectors before you were left with the one true
candidate. The point being that when there are lots of possible
answers, <em>most</em> of the evidence you need goes into just
<em>locating</em> the true hypothesis out of millions of
possibilities - bringing it to your attention in the first place.
The amount of evidence you need to judge between two or three
plausible candidates is much smaller by comparison. So if you just
jump ahead without evidence and promote one particular possibility
to the focus of your attention, you're skipping over most of the
work. Like, you live in a city where there are a million people,
and there's a murder, and a detective says, well, we've got no
evidence at all, so have we considered the possibility that
Mortimer Snodgrass did it?"</p>
<p>"Did he?" said Dumbledore.</p>
<p>"No," said Harry. "But later it turns out that the murderer had
black hair, and Mortimer has black hair, so everyone's like, ah,
looks like Mortimer did it after all. So it's unfair to Mortimer
for the police to <em>promote him to their attention</em> without
having good reasons already in hand to suspect him. When there are
lots of possibilities, most of the work goes into just
<em>locating</em> the true answer - starting to pay attention to
it. You don't need <em>proof</em>, or the sort of official evidence
that scientists or courts demand, but you need some sort of
<em>hint</em>, and that hint has to discriminate that particular
possibility from the millions of others. Otherwise you can't just
pluck the right answer out of thin air. You can't even pluck a
possibility worth thinking about out of thin air. And there's got
to be a million other things I could do besides carrying around my
father's rock. Just because I'm ignorant about the universe doesn't
mean that I'm unsure about how I should reason in the presence of
my uncertainty. The laws for thinking with probabilities are no
less iron than the laws that govern old-fashioned logic, and what
you just did is <em>not allowed.</em>" Harry paused.
"<em>Unless</em>, of course, you have some <em>hint</em> you're not
mentioning."</p>
<p>"Ah," said Dumbledore. He tapped his cheek, looking thoughtful.
"An interesting argument, certainly, but doesn't it break down at
the point where you make an analogy between a million potential
murderers only one of whom committed the murder, and taking one out
of many possible courses of action, when many possible courses of
action may all be wise? I do not say that carrying your father's
rock is the one best possible course of action, only that it is
wiser to do than not."</p>
<p>Dumbledore once again reached into the same desk drawer he had
accessed earlier, this time seeming to root around inside - at
least his arm seemed to be moving. "I will remark," Dumbledore said
while Harry was still trying to sort out how to reply to this
completely unexpected rejoinder, "that it is a common misconception
of Ravenclaws that all the smart children are Sorted there, leaving
none for other Houses. This is not so; being Sorted to Ravenclaw
indicates that you are driven by your desire to know things, which
is not at all the same quality as being intelligent." The wizard
was smiling as he bent over the drawer. "Nonetheless, you
<em>do</em> seem rather intelligent. Less like an ordinary young
hero and more like a young mysterious ancient wizard. I think I may
have been taking the wrong approach with you, Harry, and that you
may be able to understand things that few others could grasp. So I
shall be daring, and offer you a certain <em>other</em>
heirloom."</p>
<p>"You don't mean..." gasped Harry. "My father... <em>owned
another rock?</em> "</p>
<p>"Excuse me," said Dumbledore, "I <em>am</em> still older and
more mysterious than you and if there are any revelations to be
made then <em>I</em> will do the revealing, thank you... oh, where
<em>is</em> that thing!" Dumbledore reached down further into the
desk drawer, and still further. His head and shoulders and whole
torso disappeared inside until only his hips and legs were sticking
out, as though the desk drawer was eating him.</p>
<p>Harry couldn't help but wonder just how much stuff was in there
and what the complete inventory would look like.</p>
<p>Finally Dumbledore rose back up out of the drawer, holding the
objective of his search, which he set down on the desk alongside
the rock.</p>
<p>It was a used, ragged-edged, worn-spined textbook:
<em>Intermediate Potion Making</em> by Libatius Borage. There was a
picture of a smoking vial on the cover.</p>
<p>"This," Dumbledore intoned, "was your mother's fifth-year
Potions textbook."</p>
<p>"Which I am to carry with me at all times," said Harry.</p>
<p>"<em>Which holds a terrible secret</em>. A secret whose
revelation could prove so disastrous that I must ask you to swear -
and I do require you to swear it seriously, Harry, whatever you may
think of all this - never to tell anyone or anything else."</p>
<p>Harry considered his mother's fifth-year Potions textbook,
which, apparently, held a terrible secret.</p>
<p>The problem was that Harry <em>did</em> take that oaths like
that very seriously. Any vow was an Unbreakable Vow if made by the
right sort of person.</p>
<p>And...</p>
<p>"I'm feeling thirsty," Harry said, "and that is not at all a
good sign."</p>
<p>Dumbledore entirely failed to ask any questions about this
cryptic statement. "<em>Do</em> you swear, Harry?" said Dumbledore.
His eyes gazed intently into Harry's. "Otherwise I cannot tell
you."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Harry. "I swear." That was the trouble with being a
Ravenclaw. You couldn't refuse an offer like that or your curiosity
would eat you alive, and everyone else knew it.</p>
<p>"And I swear in turn," said Dumbledore, "that what I am about to
tell you is the truth."</p>
<p>Dumbledore opened the book, seemingly at random, and Harry
leaned in to see.</p>
<p>"Do you see these notes," Dumbledore said in a voice so low it
was almost a whisper, "written in the margins of the book?"</p>
<p>Harry squinted slightly. The yellowing pages seemed to be
describing something called a <em>potion of eagle's splendour,</em>
many of the ingredients being items that Harry didn't recognise at
all and whose names didn't appear to derive from English. Scrawled
in the margin was a handwritten annotation saying, <em>I wonder
what would happen if you used Thestral blood here instead of
blueberries?</em> and immediately beneath was a reply in different
handwriting, <em>You'd get sick for weeks and maybe die.</em></p>
<p>"I see them," said Harry. "What about them?"</p>
<p>Dumbledore pointed to the second scrawl. "The ones in this
handwriting," he said, still in that low voice, "were written by
your mother. And the ones in <em>this</em> handwriting," moving his
finger to indicate the first scrawl, "were written by me. I would
turn myself invisible and sneak into her dorm room while she was
sleeping. Lily thought one of her friends was writing them and they
had the most amazing fights."</p>
<p>That was the exact point at which Harry realised that the
Headmaster of Hogwarts <em>was,</em> in fact, crazy.</p>
<p>Dumbledore was looking at him with a serious expression. "Do you
understand the implications of what I have just told you,
Harry?"</p>
<p>"Ehhh..." Harry said. His voice seemed to be stuck. "Sorry...
I... not really..."</p>
<p>"Ah well," said Dumbledore, and sighed. "I suppose your
cleverness has limits after all, then. Shall we all just pretend I
didn't say anything?"</p>
<p>Harry rose from his chair, wearing a fixed smile. "Of course,"
Harry said. "You know it's actually getting rather late in the day
and I'm a bit hungry, so I should be going down to dinner, really"
and Harry made a beeline for the door.</p>
<p>The doorknob entirely failed to turn.</p>
<p>"You wound me, Harry," said Dumbledore's voice in quiet tones
that were coming from right behind him. "Do you not at least
realise that what I have told you is a sign of trust?"</p>
<p>Harry slowly turned around.</p>
<p>In front of him was a very powerful and very insane wizard with
a long silver beard, a hat like a squashed giant mushroom, and
wearing what looked to Muggle eyes like three layers of bright pink
pyjamas.</p>
<p>Behind him was a door that didn't seem to be working at the
moment.</p>
<p>Dumbledore was looking rather saddened and weary, like he wanted
to lean on a wizard's staff he didn't have. "Really," said
Dumbledore, "you try anything new instead of following the same
pattern every time for a hundred and ten years, and people all
start running away." The old wizard shook his head in sorrow. "I'd
hoped for better from you, Harry Potter. I'd heard that your own
friends also think you mad. I know they are mistaken. Will you not
believe the same of me?"</p>
<p>"Please open the door," Harry said, his voice trembling. "If you
ever want me to trust you again, open the door."</p>
<p>There was the sound behind him of a door opening.</p>
<p>"There were more things I planned to say to you," Dumbledore
said, "and if you leave now, you will not know what they were."</p>
<p>Sometimes Harry absolutely <em>hated</em> being a Ravenclaw.</p>
<p><em>He's never hurt a student,</em> said Harry's Gryffindor
side. <em>Just keep remembering that and you'll be sure not to
panic. You're not going to run away just because things are getting
interesting, are you?</em></p>
<p><em>You can't just walk out on the Headmaster!</em> said the
Hufflepuff part. <em>What if he starts deducting House points? He
could make your school life very difficult if he decides he doesn't
like you!</em></p>
<p>And a piece of himself which Harry didn't much like but couldn't
quite manage to silence was pondering the potential advantages of
being one of the few friends of this mad old wizard who also
happened to be Headmaster, Chief Warlock, and Supreme Mugwump. And
unfortunately his inner Slytherin seemed to be much better than
Draco at turning people to the Dark Side, because it was saying
things like <em>poor fellow, he looks like he needs someone to talk
to, doesn't he?</em> and <em>you wouldn't want such a powerful man
to end up trusting someone less virtuous, would you?</em> and <em>I
wonder what sort of incredible secrets Dumbledore could tell you
if, you know, you became friends with him</em> and even <em>I bet
he's got a reaallly interesting book collection.</em></p>
<p><em>You're all a bunch of lunatics,</em> Harry thought at the
entire assemblage, but he'd been unanimously outvoted by every
component part of himself.</p>
<p>Harry turned, took a step towards the open door, reached out,
and deliberately closed it again. It was a costless sacrifice given
that he was staying anyway, Dumbledore could control his movements
regardless, but maybe it would impress Dumbledore.</p>
<p>When Harry turned back around he saw that the powerful insane
wizard was once more smiling and looking friendly. That was good,
maybe.</p>
<p>"Please don't do that again," Harry said. "I don't like being
trapped."</p>
<p>"I <em>am</em> sorry about that, Harry," said Dumbledore in what
sounded like tones of sincere apology. "But it would have been
terribly unwise to let you leave without your father's rock."</p>
<p>"Of course," Harry said. "It wasn't reasonable of me to expect
the door to open before I put the quest items in my inventory."</p>
<p>Dumbledore smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>Harry went over to the desk, twisted his mokeskin pouch around
to the front of his belt, and, with some effort, managed to heave
up the rock in his eleven-year-old arms and feed it in.</p>
<p>He could actually feel the weight slowly diminishing as the
Widening Lip charm ate the rock, and the burp which followed was
rather noisy and had a distinctly complaining sound to it.</p>
<p>His mother's fifth-year Potions textbook (which held a secret
that was in fact pretty terrible) followed shortly after.</p>
<p>And then Harry's inner Slytherin made a sly suggestion for
ingratiating himself with the Headmaster, which, unfortunately, had
been perfectly pitched in such a way as to gain the support of the
majority Ravenclaw faction.</p>
<p>"So," Harry said. "Um. As long as I'm hanging around, I don't
suppose you would like to give me a bit of a tour of your office?
I'm a bit curious as to what some of these things are," and that
was his understatement for the month of September.</p>
<p>Dumbledore gazed at him, and then nodded with a slight grin.
"I'm flattered by your interest," said Dumbledore, "but I'm afraid
there isn't much to say." Dumbledore took a step closer to the wall
and pointed to a painting of a sleeping man. "These are portraits
of past Headmasters of Hogwarts." He turned and pointed to his
desk. "This is my desk." He pointed to his chair. "This is my chair
-"</p>
<p>"Excuse me," Harry said, "actually I was wondering about those."
Harry pointed to a small cube that was softly whispering
"blorple... blorple... blorple".</p>
<p>"Oh, the little fiddly things?" said Dumbledore. "They came with
the Headmaster's office and I have absolutely no idea what most of
them do. Although <em>this</em> dial with the eight hands counts
the number of, let's call them sneezes, by left-handed witches
within the borders of France, you would not believe how much work
it took to nail that down. And <em>this</em> one with the golden
wibblers is my own invention and Minerva is never, ever going to
figure out what it's doing."</p>
<p>Dumbledore took a step over to the hatrack while Harry was still
processing this. "Here of course we have the Sorting Hat, I believe
the two of you have met. It told me that it was never again to be
placed on your head under any circumstances. You're only the
fourteenth student in history it's said that about, Baba Yaga was
another one and I'll tell you about the other twelve when you're
older. This is an umbrella. This is another umbrella." Dumbledore
took another few steps and turned around, now smiling quite
broadly. "And of course, most people who come to my office want to
see Fawkes."</p>
<p>Dumbledore was standing next to the bird on the golden
platform.</p>
<p>Harry came over, rather puzzled. "This is Fawkes?"</p>
<p>"Fawkes is a phoenix," said Dumbledore. "Very rare, very
powerful magical creatures."</p>
<p>"Ah..." Harry said. He lowered his head and stared into the
tiny, beady black eyes, which showed not the slightest sign of
power or intelligence.</p>
<p>"Ahhh..." Harry said again.</p>
<p>He was pretty sure he recognised the shape of the bird. It was
pretty hard to miss.</p>
<p>"Umm..."</p>
<p><em>Say something intelligent!</em> Harry's mind roared at
itself. <em>Don't just stand there sounding like a gibbering
moron!</em></p>
<p><em>Well what the heck am I</em> supposed <em>to say?</em>
Harry's mind fired back.</p>
<p><em>Anything!</em></p>
<p><em>You mean, anything besides "Fawkes is a chicken" -</em></p>
<p><em>Yes! Anything but that!</em></p>
<p>"So, ah, what sort of magic do phoenixes do, then?"</p>
<p>"Their tears have the power to heal," Dumbledore said. "They are
creatures of fire, and move between all places as easily as fire
may extinguish itself in one place and be kindled in another. The
tremendous strain of their innate magic ages their bodies quickly,
and yet they are as close to undying as any creature that exists in
this world, for whenever their bodies fail them they immolate
themselves in a burst of fire and leave behind a hatchling, or
sometimes an egg." Dumbledore came closer and inspected the
chicken, frowning. "Hm... looking a little peaky there, I'd
say."</p>
<p>By the time this statement registered fully in Harry's mind, the
chicken was already on fire.</p>
<p>The chicken's beak opened, but it didn't have time for so much
as a single caw before it began to wither and char. The blaze was
brief, intense, and entirely self-contained; there was no smell of
burning.</p>
<p>And then the fire died down only seconds after it had begun,
leaving behind a tiny, pathetic heap of ashes on the golden
platform.</p>
<p>"Don't look so horrified, Harry!" said Dumbledore. "Fawkes
hasn't been hurt." Dumbledore's hand dipped into a pocket, and then
the same hand sifted through the ashes and turned up a small
yellowish egg. "Look, here's an egg!"</p>
<p>"Oh... wow... amazing..."</p>
<p>"But now we really should get on with things," Dumbledore said.
Leaving the egg behind in the ashes of the chicken, he returned to
his throne and seated himself. "It's almost time for dinner, after
all, and we wouldn't want to have to use our Time-Turners."</p>
<p>There was a violent power struggle going on in the Government of
Harry. Slytherin and Hufflepuff had switched sides after seeing the
Headmaster of Hogwarts set fire to a chicken.</p>
<p>"Yes, things," said Harry's lips. "And then dinner."</p>
<p><em>You're sounding like a gibbering moron again</em> observed
Harry's Internal Critic.</p>
<p>"Well," Dumbledore said. "I fear I have a confession to make,
Harry. A confession and an apology."</p>
<p>"Apologies are good" <em>that doesn't even make sense! What am I
talking about?</em></p>
<p>The old wizard sighed deeply. "You may not still think so after
understanding what I have to say. I'm afraid, Harry, that I've been
manipulating you your entire life. It was I who consigned you to
the care of your wicked stepparents -"</p>
<p>"My stepparents aren't wicked!" blurted Harry. "My
<em>parents,</em> I mean!"</p>
<p>"They aren't?" Dumbledore said, looking surprised and
disappointed. "Not even a little wicked? That doesn't fit the
pattern..."</p>
<p>Harry's inner Slytherin screamed at the top of its mental lungs,
<em>SHUT UP YOU IDIOT HE'LL TAKE YOU AWAY FROM THEM!</em></p>
<p>"No, no," said Harry, lips frozen in a ghastly grimace, "I was
just trying to spare your feelings, they're actually very
wicked..."</p>
<p>"They are?" Dumbledore leaned forward, gazing at him intently.
"What do they do?"</p>
<p><em>Talk fast</em> "they, ah, I have to do dishes and wash
problems and they don't let me read a lot of books and -"</p>
<p>"Ah, good, that's good to hear," said Dumbledore, leaning back
again. He smiled in a sad sort of way. "I apologise for
<em>that</em>, then. Now where was I? Ah, yes. I'm sorry to say,
Harry, that I am responsible for virtually everything bad that has
ever happened to you. I know that this will probably make you very
angry."</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm very angry!" said Harry. "Grrr!"</p>
<p>Harry's Internal Critic promptly awarded him the All-Time Award
for the Worst Acting in the History of Ever.</p>
<p>"And I just wanted you to know," Dumbledore said, "I wanted to
tell you as early as possible, in case something happens to one of
us later, that I am truly, truly sorry. For everything that has
already happened, and everything that will."</p>
<p>Moisture glistened in the old wizard's eyes.</p>
<p>"And I'm very angry!" said Harry. "So angry that I want to leave
right now unless you've got anything else to say!"</p>
<p><em>Just GO before he sets you on fire!</em> shrieked Slytherin,
Hufflepuff, and Gryffindor.</p>
<p>"I understand," said Dumbledore. "One last thing then, Harry.
You are <em>not</em> to attempt the forbidden door on the
third-floor corridor. There's no possible way you could get through
all the traps, and I wouldn't want to hear that you'd been hurt
trying. Why, I doubt that you could so much as open the first door,
since it's locked and you don't know the spell <em>Alohomora
-</em>"</p>
<p>Harry spun around and bolted for the exit at top speed, the
doorknob turned agreeably in his hand and then he was racing down
the spiral stairs even as they turned, his feet almost stumbling
over themselves, in just a moment he was at the bottom and the
gargoyle was walking aside and Harry fired out of the stairwell
like a cannonball.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry Potter.</p>
<p>There must have been something about Harry Potter.</p>
<p>It was Thursday for everyone, after all, and yet this sort of
thing didn't seem to happen to anyone else.</p>
<p>It was 6:21pm on Thursday afternoon when Harry Potter, firing
out of the stairwell like a cannonball and accelerating at top
speed, ran directly into Minerva McGonagall as she was turning a
corner on her way to the Headmaster's office.</p>
<p>Thankfully neither of them were much hurt. As had been explained
to Harry a little earlier in the day - back when he was refusing to
go anywhere near a broomstick again - Quidditch needed solid iron
Bludgers just to stand a decent chance of injuring the players,
since wizards tended to be a lot more resistant than Muggles to
impacts.</p>
<p>Harry and Professor McGonagall did both end up on the floor, and
the parchments she had been carrying went all over the
corridor.</p>
<p>There was a terrible, terrible pause.</p>
<p>"Harry Potter," breathed Professor McGonagall from where she was
lying on the floor right next to Harry. Her voice rose to nearly a
shriek. "<em>What were you doing in the Headmaster's
office?"</em></p>
<p>"Nothing!" squeaked Harry.</p>
<p><em>"Were you talking about the Defence Professor?"</em></p>
<p>"No! Dumbledore called me up there and he gave me this big rock
and said it was my father's and I should carry it everywhere!"</p>
<p>There was another terrible pause.</p>
<p>"I see," said Professor McGonagall, her voice a little calmer.
She stood up, brushed herself off, and glared at the scattered
parchments, which jumped into a neat stack and scurried back
against the corridor wall as though to hide from her gaze. "My
sympathies, Mr. Potter, and I apologise for doubting you."</p>
<p>"Professor McGonagall," Harry said. His voice was wavering. He
pushed himself off the floor, stood, and looked up at her
trustworthy, <em>sane</em> face. "Professor McGonagall..."</p>
<p>"Yes, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>"Do you think I should?" Harry said in a small voice. "Carry my
father's rock everywhere?"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall sighed. "That is between you and the
Headmaster, I'm afraid." She hesitated. "I will say that ignoring
the Headmaster completely is almost never wise. I <em>am</em> sorry
to hear of your dilemma, Mr. Potter, and if there's any way I
<em>can</em> help you with whatever you decide to do -"</p>
<p>"Um," Harry said. "Actually I was thinking that once I know how,
I could Transfigure the rock into a ring and wear it on my finger.
If you could teach me how to sustain a Transfiguration -"</p>
<p>"It is good that you asked me first," Professor McGonagall said,
her face growing a bit stern. "If you lost control of the
Transfiguration the reversal would cut off your finger and probably
rip your hand in half. And at your age, even a ring is too large a
target for you to sustain indefinitely without it being a serious
drain on your magic. But I can have a ring forged for you with a
setting for a jewel, a <em>small</em> jewel, in contact with your
skin, and you can practice sustaining a safe subject, like a
marshmallow. When you have kept it up successfully, even in your
sleep, for a full month, I will allow you to Transfigure, ah, your
father's rock..." Professor McGonagall's voice trailed off. "Did
the Headmaster <em>really -</em>"</p>
<p>"Yes. Ah... um..."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall sighed. "That's a bit strange even for
him." She stooped and picked up the stack of parchments. "I'm sorry
about this, Mr. Potter. I apologise again for mistrusting you. But
now it's my own turn to see the Headmaster."</p>
<p>"Ah... good luck, I guess. Er..."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>"Um..."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall walked over to the gargoyle, inaudibly
spoke the password, and stepped through into the revolving spiral
stairs. She began to rise out of sight, and the gargoyle started
back -</p>
<p>"<em>Professor McGonagall the Headmaster set fire to a
chicken!"</em></p>
<p>"He <em>wha-</em>"</p>

<p><em>"That does sound like the sort of thing I would do, doesn't

<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>It was breakfast time on Friday morning. Harry took another huge
bite out of his toast and then tried to remind his brain that
scarfing his breakfast wouldn't actually get him into the dungeons
any faster. Anyway they had a full hour of study time between
breakfast and the start of Potions.</p>
<p>But dungeons! In Hogwarts! Harry's imagination was already
sketching the chasms, narrow bridges, torchlit sconces, and patches
of glowing moss. Would there be rats? Would there be
<em>dragons?</em></p>
<p>"Harry Potter," said a quiet voice from behind him.</p>
<p>Harry looked over his shoulder and found himself beholding Ernie
Macmillan, smartly dressed in yellow-trimmed robes and looking a
little worried.</p>
<p>"Neville thought I should warn you," Ernie said in a low voice.
"I think he's right. Be careful of the Potions Master in our
session today. The older Hufflepuffs told us that Professor Snape
can be really nasty to people he doesn't like, and he doesn't like
most people who aren't Slytherins. If you say anything smart to him
it... it could be really bad for you, from what I've heard. Just
keep your head down and don't give him any reason to notice
you."</p>
<p>There was a pause as Harry processed this, and then he lifted
his eyebrows. (Harry wished he could raise just one eyebrow, like
Spock, but he'd never been able to manage.) "Thanks," Harry said.
"You might've just saved me a lot of trouble."</p>
<p>Ernie nodded, and turned to go back to the Hufflepuff table.</p>
<p>Harry resumed eating his toast.</p>
<p>It was around four bites afterward that someone said "Pardon
me," and Harry turned around to see an older Ravenclaw, looking a
little worried -</p>
<p>Some time later, Harry was finishing up his third plate of
rashers. (He'd learned to eat heavily at breakfast. He could always
eat lightly at lunch if he didn't end up using the Time-Turner.)
And there was yet another voice from behind him saying "Harry?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said wearily, "I'll try not to draw Professor
Snape's attention -"</p>
<p>"Oh, that's hopeless," said Fred.</p>
<p>"Completely hopeless," said George.</p>
<p>"So we had the house elves bake you a cake," said Fred.</p>
<p>"We're going to put one candle on it for every point you lose
for Ravenclaw," said George.</p>
<p>"And have a party for you at the Gryffindor table during lunch,"
said Fred.</p>
<p>"We hope that'll cheer you up afterward," finished George.</p>
<p>Harry swallowed his last bite of rasher and turned around. "All
right," said Harry. "I wasn't going to ask this after Professor
Binns, I really wasn't, but if Professor Snape is <em>that</em>
awful why hasn't he been fired?"</p>
<p>"Fired?" said Fred.</p>
<p>"You mean, let go?" said George.</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said. "It's what you do to bad teachers. You fire
them. Then you hire a better teacher instead. You don't have unions
or tenure here, right?"</p>
<p>Fred and George were frowning in much the same way that
hunter-gatherer tribal elders might frown if you tried to tell them
about calculus.</p>
<p>"I don't know," said Fred after a while. "I never thought about
that."</p>
<p>"Me neither," said George.</p>
<p>"Yeah," said Harry, "I get that a lot. See you at lunch, guys,
and don't blame me if there aren't any candles on that cake."</p>
<p>Fred and George both laughed, as if Harry had said something
funny, and bowed to him and headed back toward Gryffindor.</p>
<p>Harry turned back to the breakfast table and grabbed a cupcake.
His stomach already felt full, but he had a feeling this morning
might use a lot of calories.</p>
<p>As he ate his cupcake, Harry thought of the worst teacher he'd
met so far, Professor Binns of History. Professor Binns was a
ghost. From what Hermione had said about ghosts, it didn't seem
likely that they were fully self-aware. There were no famous
discoveries made by ghosts, or much of any original work, no matter
who they'd been in life. Ghosts tended to have trouble remembering
the current century. Hermione had said they were like accidental
portraits, impressed into the surrounding matter by a burst of
psychic energy accompanying a wizard's sudden death.</p>
<p>Harry had run into some stupid teachers during his abortive
forays into standard Muggle education - his father had been a lot
pickier when it came to selecting grad students as tutors, of
course - but History class was the first time he'd encountered a
teacher who literally wasn't sentient.</p>
<p>And it showed, too. Harry had given up after five minutes and
started reading a textbook. When it became clear that "Professor
Binns" wasn't going to object, Harry had also reached into his
pouch and gotten earplugs.</p>
<p>Did ghosts not require a salary? Was that it? Or was it
literally impossible to fire anyone in Hogwarts <em>even if they
died?</em></p>
<p>Now it seemed that Professor Snape was going about being
absolutely awful to everyone who wasn't a Slytherin and it hadn't
even <em>occurred</em> to anyone to terminate his contract.</p>
<p>And the Headmaster had set fire to a chicken.</p>
<p>"Excuse me," came a worried voice from behind him.</p>
<p>"I swear," Harry said without turning around, "this place is
almost eight and a half percent as bad as what Dad says about
Oxford."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry stamped down the stone corridors, looking affronted,
annoyed, and infuriated all at once.</p>
<p>"Dungeons!" Harry hissed. "<em>Dungeons!</em> These are not
dungeons! This is a basement! A <em>basement!</em> "</p>
<p>Some of the Ravenclaw girls gave him odd looks. The boys were
all used to him by now.</p>
<p>It seemed that the level in which the Potions classroom was
located was called the "dungeons" for no better reason than that it
was below ground and slightly colder than the main castle.</p>
<p>In <em>Hogwarts!</em> In <em>Hogwarts!</em> Harry had been
waiting his whole life and now he was <em>still</em> waiting and if
there was anywhere <em>on the face of the Earth</em> that had
decent dungeons it ought to be Hogwarts! Was Harry going to have to
build his own castle if he wanted to see one little bottomless
abyss?</p>
<p>A short time later they got to the actual Potions classroom and
Harry cheered up considerably.</p>
<p>The Potions classroom had strange preserved creatures floating
in huge jars on shelves that covered every centimeter of wall space
between the closets. Harry had gotten far enough along in his
reading now that he could actually identify some of the creatures,
like the Zabriskan Fontema. Albeit the fifty-centimeter spider
<em>looked</em> like an Acromantula but it was too small to
<em>be</em> one. He'd tried asking Hermione, but she hadn't seemed
very interested in looking anywhere near where he was pointing.</p>
<p>Harry was looking at a large dust ball with eyes and feet when
the assassin swept into the room.</p>
<p>That was the first thought that crossed Harry's mind when he saw
Professor Severus Snape. There was something quiet and deadly about
the way the man stalked between the children's desks. His robes
were unkempt, his hair spotted and greasy. There was something
about him that seemed reminiscent of Lucius, although the two of
them looked nothing remotely alike, and you got the impression that
where Lucius would kill you with flawless elegance, this man would
simply kill you.</p>
<p>"Sit down," said Professor Severus Snape. "Now."</p>
<p>Harry and a few other children who had been standing around
talking to each other scrambled for desks. Harry had planned on
ending up next to Hermione but somehow he found himself sitting
down in the nearest empty desk next to Justin Finch-Fletchley (it
was a Doubles session, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff) which put him two
desks to the left of Hermione.</p>
<p>Severus seated himself behind the teacher's desk, and without
the slightest transition or introduction, said, "Hannah
Abbott."</p>
<p>"Here," said Hannah in a somewhat trembling voice.</p>
<p>"Susan Bones."</p>
<p>"Present."</p>
<p>And so it went, no one daring to say a word in edgewise,
until:</p>
<p>"Ah, yes. Harry Potter. Our new... <em>celebrity.</em>"</p>
<p>"The celebrity is present, <em>sir</em>."</p>
<p>Half the class flinched, and some of the smarter ones suddenly
looked like they wanted to run out the door while the classroom was
still there.</p>
<p>Severus smiled in an anticipatory sort of way and called the
next name on his list.</p>
<p>Harry gave a mental sigh. That had happened way too fast for him
to do anything about it. Oh well. Clearly this man already didn't
like him, for whatever reason. And when Harry thought about it,
better by far that this Potions professor should pick on
<em>him</em> rather than, say, Neville or Hermione. Harry was a lot
better able to defend himself. Yep, probably all for the best.</p>
<p>When full attendance had been taken, Severus swept his gaze over
the full class. His eyes were as empty as a night sky without
stars.</p>
<p>"You are here," Severus said in a quiet voice which the students
at back strained to hear, "to learn the subtle science and exact
art of potionmaking. As there is little foolish wand-waving here,
many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you
will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron
with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep
through human veins," this in a rather caressing, gloating tone,
"bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses," this was just getting
creepier and creepier. "I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew
glory, even stopper death - if you aren't as great a pack of fools
as I usually have to teach."</p>
<p>Severus somehow seemed to notice the look of skepticism on
Harry's face, or at least his eyes suddenly jumped to where Harry
was sitting.</p>
<p>"Potter!" snapped the Potions professor. "What would I get if I
added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?"</p>
<p>Harry blinked. "Was that in <em>Magical Drafts and
Potions</em>?" he said. "I just finished reading it, and I don't
remember anything which used wormwood -"</p>
<p>Hermione's hand went up and Harry shot her a glare which caused
her to raise her hand even higher.</p>
<p>"Tut, tut," Severus said silkily. "Fame clearly isn't
everything."</p>
<p>"Really?" Harry said. "But you just told us you'd teach us how
to bottle fame. Say, how <em>does</em> that work, exactly? You
drink it and turn into a celebrity?"</p>
<p>Three-quarters of the class flinched.</p>
<p>Hermione's hand was dropping slowly back down. Well, that wasn't
surprising. She might be his rival, but she wasn't the sort of girl
who would play along after it became clear that the professor was
deliberately trying to humiliate him.</p>
<p>Harry was trying hard to keep control of his temper. The first
rejoinder that had crossed his mind was 'Abracadabra'.</p>
<p>"Let's try again," said Severus. "Potter, where would you look
if I told you to find me a bezoar?"</p>
<p>"That's not in the textbook either," Harry said, "but in one
Muggle book I read that a trichinobezoar is a mass of solidified
hair found in a human stomach, and Muggles used to believe it would
cure any poison -"</p>
<p>"Wrong," Severus said. "A bezoar is found in the stomach of a
goat, it is not made of hair, and it will cure most poisons but not
all."</p>
<p>"I didn't <em>say</em> it would, I said that was what I read in
one Muggle book -"</p>
<p>"No one here is interested in your <em>pathetic</em> Muggle
books. Final try. What is the difference, Potter, between
monksblood and wolfsbane?"</p>
<p>That did it.</p>
<p>"You know," Harry said icily, "in one of my quite
<em>fascinating</em> Muggle books, they describe a study in which
people managed to make themselves look very smart by asking
questions about random facts that only they knew. Apparently the
onlookers only noticed that the askers knew and the answerers
didn't, and failed to adjust for the unfairness of the underlying
game. So, Professor, can you tell me how many electrons are in the
outermost orbital of a carbon atom?"</p>
<p>Severus's smile widened. "Four," he said. "It is a useless fact
which no one should bother writing down, however. And for your
information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion
so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. As for
monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes
by the name of aconite, as you would know if you had read <em>One
Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi.</em> Thought you didn't need to
open the book before coming, eh, Potter? All the rest of you should
be copying that down so that you will not be as ignorant as him."
Severus paused, looking quite pleased with himself. "And that will
be... five points? No, let us make it an even ten points from
Ravenclaw for backchat."</p>
<p>Hermione gasped, along with a number of others.</p>
<p>"Professor Severus Snape," Harry bit out. "I know of nothing
which I have done to earn your enmity. If there is some problem you
have with me which I do not know about, I suggest we -"</p>
<p>"Shut up, Potter. Ten more points from Ravenclaw. The rest of
you, open your books to page 3."</p>
<p>There was only a slight, only a very faint burning sensation in
the back of Harry's throat, and no moisture at all in his eyes. If
crying was not an effective strategy for destroying this Potions
professor then there was no point in crying.</p>
<p>Slowly, Harry sat up very straight. All his blood seemed to have
been drained away and replaced with liquid nitrogen. He knew he'd
been trying to keep his temper but he couldn't seem to remember
why.</p>
<p>"Harry," whispered Hermione frantically from two desks over,
"stop, please, it's all right, we won't count it -"</p>
<p>"Talking in class, Granger? Three -"</p>
<p>"So," said a voice colder than zero Kelvin, "how does one go
about filing a formal complaint against an abusive professor? Does
one talk to the Deputy Headmistress, write a letter to the Board of
Governors... would you care to explain how it works?"</p>
<p>The class was utterly frozen.</p>
<p>"Detention for one month, Potter," Severus said, smiling even
more broadly.</p>
<p>"I decline to recognize your authority as a teacher and I will
not serve any detention you give."</p>
<p>People stopped breathing.</p>
<p>Severus's smile vanished. "Then you will be -" his voice stopped
short.</p>
<p>"Expelled, were you about to say?" Harry, on the other hand, was
now smiling thinly. "But then you seemed to doubt your ability to
carry out the threat, or fear the consequences if you did. I, on
the other hand, neither doubt nor fear the prospect of finding a
school with less abusive professors. Or perhaps I should hire
private tutors, as is my accustomed practice, and be taught at my
full learning speed. I have enough money in my vault. Something
about bounties on a Dark Lord I defeated. But there <em>are</em>
teachers at Hogwarts who I rather like, so I think it will be
easier if I find some way to get rid of you instead."</p>
<p>"Get rid of me?" Severus said, now also smiling thinly. "What an
amusing conceit. How do you suppose you will do that, Potter?"</p>
<p>"I understand there have been a number of complaints about you
from students and their parents," a guess but a safe one, "which
leaves only the question of why you're not already gone. Is
Hogwarts too financially strapped to afford a real Potions
professor? I could chip in, if so. I'm sure they could find a
better class of teacher if they offered double your current
salary."</p>
<p>Two poles of ice radiated freezing winter across the
classroom.</p>
<p>"You will find," Severus said softly, "that the Board of
Governers is not the slightest bit sympathetic to your offer."</p>
<p>"Lucius..." Harry said. "<em>That's</em> why you're still here.
Perhaps I should chat with Lucius about that. I believe he desires
to meet with me. I wonder if I have anything he wants?"</p>
<p>Hermione frantically shook her head. Harry noticed out of the
corner of his eye, but his attention was all on Severus.</p>
<p>"You are a very foolish boy," Severus said. He wasn't smiling at
all, now. "You have nothing that Lucius values more than my
friendship. And if you did, I have other allies." His voice grew
hard. "And I find it increasingly unlikely that you were not Sorted
into Slytherin. How was it that you managed to stay out of my
House? Ah, yes, because the Sorting Hat claimed it was
<em>joking</em>. For the first time in recorded history. What were
you really <em>chatting</em> about with the Sorting Hat, Potter?
Did you have something that it wanted?"</p>
<p>Harry stared into Severus's cold gaze and remembered that the
Sorting Hat had warned him not to meet anyone's eyes while thinking
about - Harry dropped his gaze to Severus's desk.</p>
<p>"You seem oddly reluctant to look me in the eyes, Potter!"</p>
<p>A shock of sudden understanding - "So it was <em>you</em> the
Sorting Hat was warning me about!"</p>
<p>"What?" said Severus's voice, sounding genuinely surprised,
though of course Harry didn't look at his face.</p>
<p>Harry got up out of his desk.</p>
<p>"Sit down, Potter," said an angry voice from somewhere he wasn't
looking.</p>
<p>Harry ignored it, and looked around the classroom. "I have no
intention of letting one unprofessional teacher ruin my time at
Hogwarts," Harry said with deadly calm. "I think I'll take my leave
of this class, and either hire a tutor to teach me Potions while
I'm here, or if the Board is really that locked up, learn over the
summer. If any of you decide that you don't care to be bullied by
this man, my sessions will be open to you."</p>
<p>"<em>Sit down, Potter!</em> "</p>
<p>Harry strode across the room and grasped the doorknob.</p>
<p>It didn't turn.</p>
<p>Harry slowly turned around, and caught a glimpse of Severus
smiling nastily before he remembered to look away.</p>
<p>"Open this door."</p>
<p>"No," said Severus.</p>
<p>"You are making me feel threatened," said a voice so icy it
didn't sound like Harry's at all, "and that is a mistake."</p>
<p>Severus's voice laughed. "What do you intend to do about it,
little boy?"</p>
<p>Harry took six long strides forward away from the door, until he
was standing near the back row of desks.</p>
<p>Then Harry drew himself upright and raised his right hand in one
terrible motion, fingers poised to snap.</p>
<p>Neville screamed and dived under his desk. Other children shrank
back or instinctively raised their arms to shield themselves.</p>
<p>"<em>Harry don't!</em> " shrieked Hermione. "Whatever you were
going to do to him, don't do it!"</p>
<p>"Have you all gone <em>mad?</em> " barked Severus's voice.</p>
<p>Slowly, Harry lowered his hand. "I wasn't going to hurt him,
Hermione," Harry said, his voice a little lower. "I was just going
to blow up the door."</p>
<p>Though now that Harry remembered it, you weren't supposed to
Transfigure things that were to be burned, which meant that going
back in time afterward and getting Fred or George to Transfigure
some carefully measured amount of explosives might not actually
have been such a good idea...</p>
<p>"<em>Silencio,</em>" said Severus's voice.</p>
<p>Harry tried to say "What?" and found that no sound was coming
out.</p>
<p>"This has become ridiculous. I think you've been allowed to get
yourself in enough trouble for one day, Potter. You are the most
disruptive and unruly student I have ever seen, and I don't recall
how many points Ravenclaw has right now, but I'm sure I can manage
to wipe them all out. Ten points from Ravenclaw. Ten points from
Ravenclaw. Ten points from Ravenclaw! Fifty points from Ravenclaw!
Now sit down and watch the rest of the class take their
lesson!"</p>
<p>Harry put his hand into his pouch and tried to say 'marker' but
of course no words came out. For one brief moment that stopped him;
and then it occurred to Harry to spell out M-A-R-K-E-R using finger
motions, which worked. P-A-D and he had a pad of paper. Harry
strode over to an empty desk, not the one he'd originally sat down
in, and scrawled a brief message. He tore off that sheet of paper,
put away the marker and pad in a pocket of his robes for quicker
access, and held up his message, not to Snape, but to the rest of
the class.</p>
<p>I'M LEAVING<br>
DOES ANYONE ELSE<br>
NEED TO GET OUT?</p>
<p>"You're insane, Potter," Severus said with cold contempt.</p>
<p>Aside from that, no one spoke.</p>
<p>Harry swept an ironic bow to the teacher's desk, walked over to
the wall, and with one smooth motion yanked open a closet door,
stepped in, and slammed the door shut behind him.</p>
<p>There was the muffled sound of someone snapping his fingers, and
then nothing.</p>
<p>In the classroom, students looked at each other in puzzlement
and fear.</p>
<p>The Potions Master's face was now completely enraged. He crossed
the room in terrible strides and yanked open the closet door.</p>
<p>The closet was empty.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>One hour earlier, Harry listened from inside the closed closet.
There was no sound from outside, and no point in taking risks
either.</p>
<p>C-L-O-A-K, his fingers spelled out.</p>
<p>Once he was invisible, he very carefully and slowly cracked open
the closet door and peeked out. No one seemed to be in the
classroom.</p>
<p>The door wasn't locked.</p>
<p>It was when Harry was outside the dangerous place and inside the
hallway, safely invisible, that some of the anger drained away and
he realized what he'd just done.</p>
<p>What he'd just done.</p>
<p>Harry's invisible face was frozen in absolute horror.</p>
<p>He'd antagonized a teacher three orders of magnitude beyond
anything he'd ever managed before. He'd threatened to walk out of
Hogwarts and might have to follow through on it. He'd lost all the
points Ravenclaw had and then he'd used the Time-Turner...</p>
<p>His imagination showed him his parents yelling at him after he
was expelled, Professor McGonagall disappointed in him, and it was
just too painful and he couldn't bear it and he <em>couldn't think
of any way to save himself -</em></p>
<p>The thought that Harry allowed himself to think was that if
getting angry had gotten him into all this trouble, then maybe when
he was angry he'd think of a way out, things seemed clearer somehow
when he was angry.</p>
<p>And the thought that Harry didn't let himself think was that he
just couldn't face this future if he wasn't angry.</p>
<p>So he cast his thoughts back and remembered the burning
humiliation -</p>
<p><em>Tut, tut. Fame clearly isn't everything.</em></p>
<p><em>Ten points from Ravenclaw for backchat.</em></p>
<p>The calming cold washed back through his veins like a wave
reflected and returning from some breaker, and Harry let out his
breath.</p>
<p>Okay. Back to being sane now.</p>
<p>He was actually feeling a bit disappointed in his non-angry self
for collapsing like that and wanting only to get out of trouble.
Professor Severus Snape was <em>everyone's</em> problem.
Normal-Harry had forgotten that and wished for a way to protect
<em>himself.</em> And let all the other victims go hang? The
question wasn't how to protect himself, the question was how to
destroy this Potions professor.</p>
<p><em>So this is my dark side, is it?</em> <em>Bit of a prejudiced
term that, my light side seems more selfish and cowardly, not to
mention confused and panicky.</em></p>
<p>And now that he was thinking clearly, it was equally clear what
to do next. He'd already given himself an extra hour to prepare,
and could get up to five hours more if required...</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Minerva McGonagall waited in the Headmaster's office.</p>
<p>Dumbledore sat in his padded throne behind his desk, dressed in
four layers of formal lavender robes. Minerva sat in a chair before
him, opposite Severus in another chair. Facing the three of them
was an empty wooden stool.</p>
<p>They were waiting for Harry Potter.</p>
<p><em>Harry,</em> Minerva thought despairingly, <em>you promised
you wouldn't bite any teachers!</em></p>
<p>And in her mind she could see very clearly the reply, Harry's
angry face and his outraged response: <em>I said I wouldn't bite
anyone who didn't bite me first!</em></p>
<p>There was a knock at the door.</p>
<p>"Come in!" Dumbledore called.</p>
<p>The door swept open, and Harry Potter entered. Minerva almost
gasped out loud. The boy looked cool, collected, and utterly in
control of himself.</p>
<p>"Good mor-" Harry's voice suddenly cut off. His jaw dropped.</p>
<p>Minerva tracked Harry's gaze, and she saw that Harry was staring
at Fawkes where the phoenix sat on its golden perch. Fawkes
fluttered his bright red-golden wings like the flickering of a
flame, and dipped his head in a measured nod to the boy.</p>
<p>Harry turned to stare at Dumbledore.</p>
<p>Dumbledore winked at him.</p>
<p>Minerva felt she was missing something.</p>
<p>Sudden uncertainty crossed Harry's face. His coolness wavered.
Fear showed in his eyes, then anger, and then the boy was calm
again.</p>
<p>A chill went down Minerva's spine. Something was not right
here.</p>
<p>"Please sit down," said Dumbledore. His face was now serious
once more.</p>
<p>Harry sat.</p>
<p>"So, Harry," said Dumbledore. "I've heard one report of this day
from Professor Snape. Would you care to tell me what happened in
your own words?"</p>
<p>Harry's gaze flicked dismissively to Severus. "It's not
complicated," said the boy, smiling thinly. "He tried bullying me
the way he's been bullying every non-Slytherin in the school since
the day Lucius foisted him off on you. As for the other details, I
request a private conversation with you concerning them. A student
who is reporting abusive behavior from a professor can hardly be
expected to speak frankly in front of that same professor, after
all."</p>
<p>This time Minerva couldn't stop herself from gasping out
loud.</p>
<p>Severus simply laughed.</p>
<p>And the Headmaster's face grew grave. "Mr. Potter," the
Headmaster said, "one does not speak of a Hogwarts professor in
such terms. I fear that you labor under a terrible misapprehension.
Professor Severus Snape has my fullest confidence, and serves
Hogwarts at my own behest, not Lucius Malfoy's."</p>
<p>There was silence for a few moments.</p>
<p>When the boy spoke again his voice was icy. "Am I missing
something here?"</p>
<p>"Quite a number of things, Mr. Potter," said the Headmaster.
"You should understand, to start with, that the purpose of this
meeting is to discuss how to discipline you for the events of this
morning."</p>
<p>"This man has terrorized your school for years. I spoke to
students and collected stories to make sure there would be enough
for a newspaper campaign to rally the parents against him. Some of
the younger students cried while they told me. I almost cried when
I heard them! <em>You allowed this abuser to run free? You did this
to your students? Why?</em> "</p>
<p>Minerva swallowed a lump in her throat. She'd - thought that,
sometimes, but somehow she'd never quite -</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter," said the Headmaster, his voice now stern, "this
meeting is not about Professor Snape. It is about you and your
disregard for school discipline. Professor Snape has suggested, and
I have agreed, that three full months of detention will be
appropriate -"</p>
<p>"Declined," Harry said icily.</p>
<p>Minerva was speechless.</p>
<p>"This is not a request, Mr. Potter," the Headmaster said. The
full, entire force of the wizard's gaze was turned on the boy.
"This is your punishme-"</p>
<p>"You will explain to me why you allowed this man to hurt the
children placed in your care, and if your explanation is not
sufficient then I will begin my newspaper campaign with
<em>you</em> as the target."</p>
<p>Minerva's body swayed with the force of that blow, with the
sheer raw <em>lese majeste</em>.</p>
<p>Even Severus looked shocked.</p>
<p>"That, Harry, would be most extremely unwise," Dumbledore said
slowly. "I am the primary piece opposing Lucius on the gameboard.
For you to do such a thing would strengthen him greatly, and I did
not think that was your chosen side."</p>
<p>The boy was still for a long moment.</p>
<p>"This conversation grows private," Harry said. His hand flicked
in Severus's direction. "Send him away."</p>
<p>Dumbledore shook his head. "Harry, did I not tell you that
Severus Snape has my fullest confidence?"</p>
<p>The boy's face showed the shock of it. "This man's bullying
makes you vulnerable! I am not the only one who could start a
newspaper campaign against you! This is insane! Why are you doing
this?"</p>
<p>Dumbledore sighed. "I'm sorry, Harry. It has to do with things
that you are not, at this time, ready to hear."</p>
<p>The boy stared at Dumbledore. Then he turned to look at Severus.
Then back to Dumbledore again.</p>
<p>"It <em>is</em> insanity," the boy said slowly. "You haven't
reined him in because you think he's <em>part of the pattern</em>.
That Hogwarts needs an evil Potions Master to be a proper magical
school, just as it needs a ghost to teach History."</p>
<p>"That does sound like the sort of thing I would do, doesn't it?"
said Dumbledore, smiling.</p>
<p>"Unacceptable," Harry said flatly. His gaze was now cold and
dark. "I will not tolerate bullying or abuse. I had considered many
possible ways of dealing with this problem, but I will make it
simple. Either this man goes, or I do."</p>
<p>Minerva gasped again. Something strange flickered in Severus's
eyes.</p>
<p>Now Dumbledore's gaze was also growing cold. "Expulsion, Mr.
Potter, is the final threat which may be used against a student. It
is not customarily used as a threat by students against the
Headmaster. This is the best magical school in the entire world,
and an education here is not an opportunity given to everyone. Are
you under the impression that Hogwarts cannot get along without
you?"</p>
<p>And Harry sat there, smiling thinly.</p>
<p>Sudden horror dawned on Minerva. Surely Harry wouldn't -</p>
<p>"You forget," Harry said, "that you're not the only one who can
see patterns. <em>This grows private. Now send him</em> -" Harry
flicked a hand at Severus again, and then stopped in mid-sentence
and mid-gesture.</p>
<p>Minerva could see it on Harry's face, the moment when he
remembered.</p>
<p>She'd told him, after all.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter," said the Headmaster, "once again, Severus Snape
has my fullest confidence."</p>
<p>"You told him," whispered the boy. "You utter fool."</p>
<p>Dumbledore didn't react to the insult. "Told him what?"</p>
<p>"That the Dark Lord is alive."</p>
<p>"<em>What in Merlin's name are you on about, Potter?</em> "
cried Severus in tones of sheer astonishment and outrage.</p>
<p>Harry glanced briefly at him, smiling grimly. "Oh, so we
<em>are</em> a Slytherin, then," Harry said. "I was starting to
wonder."</p>
<p>And then there was silence.</p>
<p>Finally Dumbledore spoke. His voice was mild. "Harry, what
<em>are</em> you talking about?"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Albus," Minerva whispered.</p>
<p>Severus and Dumbledore turned to look at her.</p>
<p>"Professor McGonagall didn't tell me," said Harry's voice,
swiftly and less calm than it had been. "I guessed. I told you, I
can see the patterns too. I guessed, and she controlled her
reaction just as Severus did. But her control fell a shade short of
perfection, and I could tell it was control, not genuine."</p>
<p>"And I told him," said Minerva, her voice trembling a little,
"that you, and I, and Severus were the only ones who knew."</p>
<p>"Which she did as a concession to prevent me from simply going
around asking questions, as I threatened to do if she didn't talk,"
Harry said. The boy chuckled briefly. "I really should have gotten
one of you alone and told you that she told me everything, to see
if you let anything slip. Probably wouldn't have worked, but would
have been worth a shot." The boy smiled again. "Threat's still on
the table and I do expect to be briefed <em>fully</em> at some
point."</p>
<p>Severus was giving her a look of utter contempt. Minerva raised
her chin and bore it. She knew it was deserved.</p>
<p>Dumbledore leaned back in his padded throne. His eyes were as
cold as anything Minerva had seen from him since the day his
brother died. "And you threaten to abandon us to Voldemort if we do
not comply with your wishes."</p>
<p>Harry's voice was razor-sharp. "I regret to inform you that you
are not the center of the universe. I'm not threatening to walk out
on magical Britain. I'm threatening to walk out on <em>you</em>. I
am not a meek little Frodo. This is <em>my</em> quest and if you
want in you will play by <em>my</em> rules."</p>
<p>Dumbledore's face was still cold. "I am beginning to doubt your
suitability as the hero, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>Harry's return gaze was equally icy. "I am beginning to doubt
your suitability as my Gandalf, <em>Mr. Dumbledore</em>. Boromir
was at least a plausible mistake. What is this <em>Nazgul</em>
doing in my Fellowship?"</p>
<p>Minerva was completely lost. She looked at Severus, to see if he
was following this, and she saw that Severus had turned his face
away from Harry's field of vision and was smiling.</p>
<p>"I suppose," Dumbledore said slowly, "that from your perspective
it is a reasonable question. So, Mr. Potter, if Professor Snape is
to leave you alone henceforth, will that be the last time this
issue arises, or will I find you here every week with a new
demand?"</p>
<p>"Leave <em>me</em> alone?" Harry's voice was outraged. "I am not
his only victim and certainly not the most vulnerable! <em>Have you
forgotten how defenseless children are? How much they hurt?</em>
Henceforth Severus will treat <em>every</em> student of Hogwarts
with appropriate and professional courtesy, or you will find
another Potions Master, or you will find another hero!"</p>
<p>Dumbledore started laughing. Full-throated, warm, humorous
laughter, as if Harry had just performed a comic dance in front of
him.</p>
<p>Minerva didn't dare move. Her eyes flickered and she saw that
Severus was equally motionless.</p>
<p>Harry's visage grew even colder. "You mistake me, Headmaster, if
you think that this is a joke. This is not a request. This is your
punishment."</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter -" Minerva said. She didn't even know what she was
going to say. She simply couldn't let that go by.</p>
<p>Harry made a shushing gesture at her and continued to speak to
Dumbledore. "And if that seems impolite to you," Harry said, his
voice now a little less hard, "it seemed no less impolite when you
said it to me. You would not say such a thing to anyone who you
considered a real human being instead of a subordinate child, and I
will treat you with just the same courtesy as you treat me -"</p>
<p>"Oh, indeed, in very deed, this is my punishment if ever there
was one! Of <em>course</em> you're in here blackmailing me to save
your fellow students, not to save yourself! I can't imagine why I
would have thought otherwise!" Dumbledore was now laughing even
harder. He pounded his fist on the desk three times.</p>
<p>Harry's gaze grew uncertain. His face turned toward her,
addressing her for the first time. "Excuse me," Harry said. His
voice seemed to be wavering. "Does he need to take his medication
or something?"</p>
<p>"Ah..." Minerva had no idea what she could possibly say.</p>
<p>"Well," said Dumbledore. He wiped away tears that had formed in
his eyes. "Pardon me. I'm sorry for the interruption. Please
continue with the blackmail."</p>
<p>Harry opened his mouth, then closed it again. He now seemed a
little unsteady. "Ah... he's also to stop reading students'
minds."</p>
<p>"Minerva," Severus said, his voice deadly, "you -"</p>
<p>"Sorting Hat warned me," said Harry.</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> "</p>
<p>"Can't say anything else. Anyway I think that's it. I'm
done."</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>"Now what?" Minerva said, when it became apparent that no one
else was going to say anything.</p>
<p>"Now what?" Dumbledore echoed. "Why, now the hero wins, of
course."</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " said Severus, Minerva, and Harry.</p>
<p>"Well, he certainly seems to have backed us into a corner,"
Dumbledore said, smiling happily. "But Hogwarts <em>does</em> need
an evil Potions Master, or it just wouldn't be a proper magical
school, now would it? So how about if Professor Snape is only awful
toward students in their fifth year and higher?"</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " said all three of them again.</p>
<p>"If it's the most vulnerable victims about whom you're
concerned. Maybe you're right, Harry. Maybe I <em>have</em>
forgotten over the decades what it's like to be a child. So let's
compromise. Severus will continue to unfairly award points to
Slytherin and impose lax discipline on his House, and he will be
awful to non-Slytherin students in their fifth year and higher. To
others he will be scary, but not abusive. He will promise to only
read minds when the safety of a student requires it. Hogwarts will
have its evil Potions Master, and the most vulnerable victims, as
you put it, will be safe."</p>
<p>Minerva McGonagall was as shocked as she'd ever been in her
life. She glanced uncertainly at Severus, whose face had been left
completely neutral, as though he couldn't decide what sort of
expression he ought to be wearing.</p>
<p>"I suppose that is acceptable," Harry said. His voice sounded a
bit odd.</p>
<p>"You can't be serious," Severus said, his voice as
expressionless as his face.</p>
<p>"I am very much in favor of this," Minerva said slowly. She was
so much in favor that her heart was pounding wildly beneath her
robes. "But what could we possibly tell the students? They might
not have questioned this while Severus was... being awful to
everyone, but -"</p>
<p>"Harry can tell the other students that he discovered a terrible
secret of Severus's and did a bit of blackmail," said Dumbledore.
"It's true, after all; he discovered that Severus was reading
minds, and he certainly did blackmail us."</p>
<p>"This is insanity!" exploded Severus.</p>
<p>"Bwah ha ha!" said Dumbledore.</p>
<p>"Ah..." said Harry uncertainly. "And if anyone asks me why fifth
years and above got shafted? I wouldn't blame them for being irate,
and that part wasn't exactly my idea -"</p>
<p>"Tell them," said Dumbledore, "that it wasn't you who suggested
the compromise, that it was all you could get. And then refuse to
say anything more. That, too, is true. There's an art to it, you'll
pick it up with practice."</p>
<p>Harry nodded slowly. "And the points he took from
Ravenclaw?"</p>
<p>"They must not be given back."</p>
<p>It was Minerva who said it.</p>
<p>Harry looked at her.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Mr. Potter," she said. She <em>was</em> sorry, but
it had to be done. "There <em>must</em> be some consequences for
your misbehavior or this school will fall to pieces."</p>
<p>Harry shrugged. "Acceptable," he said flatly. "But in the future
Severus will not strike at my House connections by taking points
from me, nor will he waste my valuable time with detentions. Should
he feel that my behavior requires correction, he may communicate
his concerns to Professor McGonagall."</p>
<p>"Harry," Minerva said, "will you continue to submit to school
discipline, or are you to be above the law now, as Severus
was?"</p>
<p>Harry looked at her. Something warm touched his gaze, briefly
before it was quashed. "I will continue to be an ordinary student
to every member of the staff who is not insane or evil, provided
that they do not come under pressure from others who are." Harry
glanced briefly at Severus, then turned back to Dumbledore. "Leave
Minerva alone, and I'll be a regular Hogwarts student in her
presence. No special privileges or immunities."</p>
<p>"Beautiful," Dumbledore said sincerely. "Spoken like a true
hero."</p>
<p>"And," she said, "Mr. Potter must publicly apologize for his
actions of today."</p>
<p>Harry gave her another look. This one was a bit skeptical.</p>
<p>"The discipline of the school has been gravely injured by your
actions, Mr. Potter," Minerva said. "It must be restored."</p>
<p>"I think, Professor McGonagall, that you considerably
overestimate the importance of what you call school discipline, as
compared to having History taught by a live teacher or not
torturing your students. Maintaining the current status hierarchy
and enforcing its rules seems ever so much more wise and moral and
important when you are on the top and doing the enforcing than when
you are on the bottom, and I can cite studies to this effect if
required. I could go on for several hours about this point, but I
will leave it at that."</p>
<p>Minerva shook her head. "Mr. Potter, you underestimate the
importance of discipline because you are not in need of it yourself
-" She paused. That hadn't come out right, and Severus, Dumbledore,
and even Harry were giving her strange looks. "To learn, I mean.
Not every child can learn in the absence of authority. And it is
the other children who will be hurt, Mr. Potter, if they see your
example as one to be followed."</p>
<p>Harry's lips curved into a twisted smile. "The first and last
resort is the truth. The truth is that I shouldn't have gotten
angry, I shouldn't have disrupted the class, I shouldn't have done
what I did, and I set a bad example for everyone. The truth is also
that Severus Snape behaved in a fashion unbecoming a Hogwarts
professor, and that from now on he will be more mindful of the
injured feelings of students in their fourth year and under. The
two of us could both get up and speak the truth. I could live with
that."</p>
<p>"In your dreams, Potter!" spat Severus.</p>
<p>"After all," said Harry, smiling grimly, "if the students see
that rules are for <em>everyone...</em> for professors too, not
just for poor helpless students who get nothing but suffering out
of the system... why, the positive effects on school discipline
should be <em>tremendous.</em>"</p>
<p>There was a brief pause, and then Dumbledore chuckled. "Minerva
is thinking that you're righter than you have any right to be."</p>
<p>Harry's gaze jerked away from Dumbledore, down to the floor.
"Are <em>you</em> reading <em>her</em> mind?"</p>
<p>"Common sense is often mistaken for Legilimency," said
Dumbledore. "I shall talk over this matter with Severus, and no
apology will be required from you unless he apologizes as well. And
now I declare this matter concluded, at least until lunchtime." He
paused. "Although, Harry, I'm afraid that Minerva wished to speak
with you about an additional matter. And that is not the result of
any pressure on my part. Minerva, if you would?"</p>
<p>Minerva rose from her chair and almost fell. There was too much
adrenaline in her blood, her heart was beating too fast.</p>
<p>"Fawkes," said Dumbledore, "accompany her, please."</p>
<p>"I don't -" she started to say.</p>
<p>Dumbledore shot her a look, and she fell silent.</p>
<p>The phoenix soared across the room like a smooth tongue of flame
leaping out, and landed on her shoulder. She felt the warmth
through her robes, all through her body.</p>
<p>"Please follow me, Mr. Potter," she said, firmly now, and they
left through the door.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>They stood on the rotating stairs, descending in silence.</p>
<p>Minerva didn't know what to say. She didn't know this person who
stood beside her.</p>
<p>And Fawkes began to croon.</p>
<p>It was tender, and soft, like a fireplace would sound if it had
melody, and it washed over Minerva's mind, easing, soothing,
gentling what it touched...</p>
<p>"<em>What</em> is <em>that?</em> " Harry whispered beside her.
His voice was unstable, wobbling, changing pitch.</p>
<p>"The song of the phoenix," said Minerva, not really aware of
what she was saying, her attention was all on that strange quiet
music. "It, too, heals."</p>
<p>Harry turned his face from her, but she caught a glimpse of
something agonized.</p>
<p>The descent seemed to take a very long time, or maybe it was
only that the music seemed to take a very long time, and when they
stepped out through the gap where a gargoyle had been, she was
holding Harry's hand firmly in hers.</p>
<p>As the gargoyle stepped back into place, Fawkes left her
shoulder, and swooped to hover in front of Harry.</p>
<p>Harry stared at Fawkes like someone hypnotized by the
ever-changing light of a fire.</p>
<p>"What am I to do, Fawkes?" whispered Harry. "I couldn't have
protected them if I hadn't been angry."</p>
<p>The phoenix's wings continued flapping, it continued hovering in
place. There was no sound but the beating of the wings. Then there
was a flash like a fire flaring up and going out, and Fawkes was
gone.</p>
<p>Both of them blinked, like waking up from a dream, or maybe like
falling asleep again.</p>
<p>Minerva looked down.</p>
<p>Harry Potter's bright young face looked up at her.</p>
<p>"Are phoenixes people?" said Harry. "I mean, are they smart
enough to count as people? Could I talk with Fawkes if I knew
how?"</p>
<p>Minerva blinked hard. Then she blinked again. "No," Minerva
said, her voice wavering. "Phoenixes are creatures of powerful
magic. That magic gives their existence a weight of meaning which
no simple animal could possess. They are fire, light, healing,
rebirth. But in the end, no."</p>
<p>"Where can I get one?"</p>
<p>Minerva leaned down and hugged him. She hadn't meant to, but she
didn't seem to have much choice in the matter.</p>
<p>When she stood up she found it hard to speak. But she had to
ask. "What happened today, Harry?"</p>
<p>"I don't know the answers to any of the important questions
either. Aside from that I'd really rather not think about it for a
while."</p>
<p>Minerva took his hand in hers again, and they walked the rest of
the way in silence.</p>
<p>It was only a short trip, since naturally the office of the
Deputy was close to the office of the Headmaster.</p>
<p>Minerva sat behind her desk.</p>
<p>Harry sat in front of her desk.</p>
<p>"So," Minerva whispered. She would have given almost anything
not to do this, or not to be the one who had to do it, or for it to
be any time but right now. "There is a matter of school discipline.
From which you are not exempt."</p>
<p>"Namely?" said Harry.</p>
<p>He didn't know. He hadn't figured it out yet. She felt her
throat tighten. But there was work to be done and she would not
shirk it.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter," said Professor McGonagall, "I need to see your
Time-Turner, please."</p>
<p>All the peace of the phoenix vanished from his face in an
instant and Minerva felt like she had just stabbed him.</p>
<p>"<em>No!</em> " Harry said. His voice was panicked. "I need it,
I won't be able to attend Hogwarts, I won't be able to sleep!"</p>
<p>"You'll be able to sleep," she said. "The Ministry has delivered
the protective shell for your Time-Turner. I will enchant it to
open only between the hours of 9PM and midnight."</p>
<p>Harry's face twisted. "But - but I -"</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter, how many times have you used the Time-Turner since
Monday? How many hours?"</p>
<p>"I..." Harry said. "Hold on, let me add it up -" He glanced down
at his watch.</p>
<p>Minerva felt a rush of sadness. She'd thought so. "It wasn't
just two per day, then. I suspect that if I asked your dormmates, I
would find that you were struggling to stay up long enough to go to
sleep at a reasonable time, and waking up earlier and earlier every
morning. Correct?"</p>
<p>Harry's face said everything she needed to know.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter," she said gently, "there are students who cannot be
entrusted with Time-Turners, because they become addicted to them.
We give them a potion which lengthens their sleep cycle by the
necessary amount, but they end up using the Time-Turner for more
than just attending their classes. And so we must take them back.
Mr. Potter, you have taken to using the Time-Turner as your
solution to everything, often very foolishly so. You used it to get
back a Remembrall. You vanished from a closet in a fashion apparent
to other students, instead of going back after you were out and
getting me or someone else to come and open the door."</p>
<p>From the look on Harry's face he hadn't thought of that.</p>
<p>"And more importantly," she said, "you should have simply sat in
Professor Snape's class. And watched. And left at the end of class.
As you would have done if you had not possessed a Time-Turner.
There are some students who cannot be entrusted with Time-Turners,
Mr. Potter. You are one of them. I am sorry."</p>
<p>"But I <em>need</em> it!" Harry blurted. "What if there are
Slytherins threatening me and I have to escape? It keeps me
<em>safe</em> -"</p>
<p>"Every other student in this castle runs the same risk, and I
assure you that they survive. No student has died in this castle
for fifty years. Mr. Potter, you will hand over your Time-Turner
and do so now."</p>
<p>Harry's face twisted in agony, but he drew out the Time-Turner
from under his robes and gave it to her.</p>
<p>From her desk, Minerva drew out one of the protective shells
that had been sent to Hogwarts. She snapped the cover into place
around the Time-Turner's turning hourglass, and then she laid her
wand on the cover to complete the enchantment.</p>
<p>"<em>This isn't fair!</em> " Harry shrieked. "I saved half of
Hogwarts from Professor Snape today, is it right that I be punished
for it? I saw the look on your face, you <em>hated</em> what he was
doing!"</p>
<p>Minerva didn't speak for a few moments. She was enchanting.</p>
<p>When she finished and looked up, she knew that her face was
stern. Maybe it was the wrong thing to do. And then again maybe it
was the right thing to do. There was an obstinate child in front of
her, and that <em>didn't</em> mean the universe was broken.</p>
<p>"<em>Fair,</em> Mr. Potter?" she snapped. "I have had to file
<em>two reports</em> with the Ministry on public use of a
Time-Turner in <em>two successive days!</em> Be <em>extremely</em>
grateful you were allowed to retain the Time-Turner even in
restricted form! The Headmaster made a Floo call to plead with them
personally and if you were not the Boy-Who-Lived even that would
not have sufficed!"</p>
<p>Harry gaped at her.</p>
<p>She knew that he was seeing the angry face of Professor
McGonagall.</p>
<p>Harry's eyes filled up with tears.</p>
<p>"I'm, sorry," he whispered, voice now choked and broken. "I'm
sorry, to have, disappointed you..."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry too, Mr. Potter," she said sternly, and handed him
the newly restricted Time-Turner. "You may go."</p>
<p>Harry turned and fled from her office, sobbing. She heard his
feet pattering away down the hall, and then the sound cut off as
the door swung closed.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry too, Harry," she whispered to the quiet room. "I'm
sorry too."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Fifteen minutes into lunch hour.</p>
<p>No one was speaking to Harry. Some of the Ravenclaws were
shooting him looks of anger, others of sympathy, a few of the
youngest students even had looks of admiration, but no one was
talking to him. Even Hermione hadn't tried to come over.</p>
<p>Fred and George had gingerly stepped near. They hadn't said
anything. The offer was clear, and its optionality. Harry had told
them that he would come over when dessert started, no earlier. They
had nodded and quickly walked away.</p>
<p>It was probably the utterly expressionless look on Harry's face
that was doing it.</p>
<p>The others probably thought he was controlling anger, or dismay.
They knew, because they'd seen Flitwick come and get him, that he'd
been called to the Headmaster's office.</p>
<p>Harry was trying not to smile, because if he smiled, he would
start laughing, and if he started laughing, he wouldn't stop until
the nice people in white jackets came to haul him away.</p>
<p>It was too much. It was just all too much. Harry had almost gone
over to the Dark Side, his dark side had done things that seemed in
retrospect insane, his dark side had won an impossible victory that
might have been real and might have been a pure whim of a crazy
Headmaster, his dark side had protected his friends. He just
couldn't handle it any more. He needed Fawkes to sing to him again.
He needed to use the Time-Turner to go off and take a quiet hour to
recover but that wasn't an option any more and the loss was like a
hole in his existence but he couldn't think about that because then
he might start laughing.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes. All the students who were going to eat lunch had
arrived, almost none had departed.</p>
<p>The tapping of a spoon rang through the Great Hall.</p>
<p>"If I may have your attention please," Dumbledore said. "Harry
Potter has something he would like to share with us."</p>
<p>Harry took a deep breath and got up. He walked over to the Head
Table, with every eye staring at him.</p>
<p>Harry turned and looked out at the four tables.</p>
<p>It was becoming harder and harder not to smile, but Harry kept
his face expressionless as he spoke his brief and memorized
speech.</p>
<p>"The truth is sacred," Harry said tonelessly. "One of my most
treasured possessions is a button which reads 'Speak the truth,
even if your voice trembles'. This, then, is the truth. Remember
that. I am not saying it because I am being forced to say it, I am
saying it because it is true. What I did in Professor Snape's class
was foolish, stupid, childish, and an inexcusable violation of the
rules of Hogwarts. I disrupted the classroom and deprived my fellow
students of their irreplaceable learning time. All because I failed
to control my temper. I hope that not a single one of you will ever
follow my example. I certainly intend to try never to follow it
again."</p>
<p>Many of the students gazing at Harry now had solemn, unhappy
looks upon their faces, such as one might see at a ceremony marking
the loss of a fallen champion. At the younger parts of the
Gryffindor table the look was almost universal.</p>
<p>Until Harry raised his hand.</p>
<p>He did not raise it high. That might have appeared preemptory.
He certainly did not raise it toward Severus. Harry simply raised
his hand to chest level, and softly snapped his fingers, a gesture
that was seen more than heard. It was possible that most of the
Head Table wouldn't see it at all.</p>
<p>This seeming gesture of defiance won sudden smiles from the
younger students and Gryffindors, and coldly superior sneers from
Slytherin, and frowns and worried looks from all others.</p>
<p>Harry kept his face expressionless. "Thank you," he said.
"That's all."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Mr. Potter," said the Headmaster. "And now Professor
Snape has something to share with us as well."</p>
<p>Severus smoothly stood up from his place at the Head Table. "It
has been brought to my attention," he said, "that my own actions
played a part in provoking the admittedly inexcusable anger of Mr.
Potter, and in the ensuing discussion I realized that I had
forgotten how easily injured are the feelings of the young and
immature -"</p>
<p>There was the sound of many people emitting muffled chokes at
the same time.</p>
<p>Severus continued as if he had not heard. "The Potions classroom
is a dangerous place, and I still feel that strict discipline is
necessary, but henceforth I will be more aware of the... emotional
fragility... of students in their fourth year and younger. My
deduction of points from Ravenclaw still stands, but I will revoke
Mr. Potter's detention. Thank you."</p>
<p>There was a single clap from the direction of Gryffindor and
faster than lightning Severus's wand was in his hand and
"<em>Quietus!</em> " silenced the offender.</p>
<p>"I will still demand discipline and respect in <em>all</em> my
classes," Severus said coldly, "and anyone who trifles with me will
regret it."</p>
<p>He sat down.</p>
<p>"Thank you too!" Headmaster Dumbledore said cheerfully. "Carry
on!"</p>
<p>And Harry, still expressionless, began to walk back to his seat
in Ravenclaw.</p>
<p>There was an explosion of conversation. Two words were clearly
identifiable in the beginning. The first was an initial "What -"
beginning many different sentences such as "What just happened -"
and "What the hell -" The second was "<em>Scourgify!</em> " as
students cleaned up the dropped food and spit-out drinks from
themselves, the tablecloth, and each other.</p>
<p>Some students were weeping openly. So was Professor Sprout.</p>
<p>At the Gryffindor table, where a cake waited with fifty-one
unlit candles, Fred whispered, "I think we may be out of our league
here, George."</p>
<p>And from that day onward, no matter what Hermione tried to tell
anyone, it would be an accepted legend of Hogwarts that Harry
Potter could make absolutely anything happen by snapping his
fingers.</p>

<p>Draco had a stern expression on his face, and his green-trimmed
robes somehow looked far more formal, serious, and well-turned-out
than the same exact robes as worn by the two boys behind him.</p>
<p>"Talk," said Draco.</p>
<p>"Yeah! Talk!"</p>
<p>"You heard da boss! Talk!"</p>
<p>"You two, on the other hand, <em>shut up.</em>"</p>
<p>The last session of classes on Friday was about to start, in
that vast auditorium where all four Houses learned Defense, er,
Battle Magic.</p>
<p>The last session of classes on Friday.</p>
<p>Harry was hoping that this class would be non-stressful, and
that the brilliant Professor Quirrell would realize this was
perhaps not the best time to single out Harry for anything. Harry
had recovered a little, but...</p>
<p>...but just in case, it was probably best to get in a bit of
stress relief first.</p>
<p>Harry leaned back in his chair and bestowed a look of great
solemnity upon Draco and his minions.</p>
<p>"You ask, what is our aim?" Harry declaimed. "I can answer in
one word. It is victory. Victory at all costs - Victory in spite of
all terrors - Victory, however long and hard the road may be, for
without victory there is no -"</p>
<p>"<em>Talk about Snape,</em>" Draco hissed. "<em>What did you
do?</em> "</p>
<p>Harry wiped away the fake solemnity and gave Draco a more
serious look.</p>
<p>"You saw it," Harry said. "Everyone saw it. I snapped my
fingers."</p>
<p>"<em>Harry! Stop teasing me!</em> "</p>
<p>So he'd been promoted to <em>Harry</em> now. Interesting. And in
fact Harry was fairly sure that he was meant to notice that, and
feel bad if he didn't respond somehow...</p>
<p>Harry tapped his ears and gave a significant glance at the
minions.</p>
<p>"They won't talk," said Draco.</p>
<p>"Draco," Harry said, "I'm going to be one hundred percent honest
here and say that yesterday I was not particularly impressed with
Mr. Goyle's cunning."</p>
<p>Mr. Goyle winced.</p>
<p>"Me neither," said Draco. "I explained to him that I ended up
owing you a favor because of it." (Mr. Goyle winced again.) "But
there <em>is</em> a big difference between that sort of mistake and
being indiscreet. That really is something they've been trained
from childhood to understand."</p>
<p>"All right then," Harry said. He lowered his voice, even though
the background noises had gone to blurs in Draco's presence. "I
deduced one of Severus's secrets and did a bit of blackmail."</p>
<p>Draco's expression hardened. "Good, now tell me something you
didn't tell in strict confidence to the idiots in Gryffindor,
meaning that was the story you <em>wanted</em> to get all over the
school."</p>
<p>Harry grinned involuntarily and he knew that Draco had caught
it.</p>
<p>"What is Severus saying?" Harry said.</p>
<p>"That he hadn't realized how sensitive the feelings of young
children were," Draco said. "Even in Slytherin! Even to
<em>me!</em> "</p>
<p>"Are you sure," Harry said, "that you want to know something
your Head of House would rather you not know?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Draco said without hesitation.</p>
<p><em>Interesting.</em> "Then you really are going to send your
minions away first, because I'm not sure I can believe everything
you believe about them."</p>
<p>Draco nodded. "Okay."</p>
<p>Mr. Crabbe and Mr. Goyle looked <em>very</em> unhappy. "Boss -"
said Mr. Crabbe.</p>
<p>"You've given Mr. Potter no reason to trust you," Draco said.
"Go!"</p>
<p>They left.</p>
<p>"In particular," Harry said, lowering his voice even further,
"I'm not <em>entirely</em> sure that they wouldn't just report what
I said to Lucius."</p>
<p>"Father wouldn't <em>do</em> that!" Draco said, looking
genuinely aghast. "They're <em>mine!</em> "</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Draco," Harry said. "I'm just not sure I can believe
everything you believe about your father. Imagine it was your
secret and me telling you my father wouldn't do that."</p>
<p>Draco nodded slowly. "You're right. <em>I'm</em> sorry, Harry.
It was wrong of me to ask it of you."</p>
<p><em>How did I get</em> this <em>promoted? Shouldn't he hate me
now?</em> Harry had the feeling he was looking at something
exploitable... he just wished his brain wasn't so exhausted.
Ordinarily he would have loved to try his hand at some complicated
plotting.</p>
<p>"Anyway," Harry said. "Trade. I tell you a fact that isn't on
the grapevine, and does not <em>go</em> on the grapevine, and in
<em>particular</em> does not go to your father, and in return you
tell me what you and Slytherin think about the whole business."</p>
<p>"Deal!"</p>
<p>Now to make this as vague as possible... something that wouldn't
hurt much even if it did get out... "What I said was true. I did
discover one of Severus's secrets, and I did do some blackmail. But
Severus wasn't the only person involved."</p>
<p>"<em>I knew it!</em> " Draco said exultantly.</p>
<p>Harry's stomach sank. He had apparently said something very
significant and he did not know why. This was not a good sign.</p>
<p>"All right," Draco said. He was grinning widely now. "So here's
what the reaction was like in Slytherin. First, all the idiots were
like, 'We hate Harry Potter! Let's go beat him up!'"</p>
<p>Harry choked. "What is <em>wrong</em> with the Sorting Hat?
That's not Slytherin, it's <em>Gryffindor</em> -"</p>
<p>"Not all children are prodigies," Draco said, though he was
smiling in a sort of nasty-conspiratorial way, as though to suggest
that he privately agreed with Harry's opinion. "And it took around
fifteen seconds for someone to explain to them why this might not
be such a favor to Snape, so you're fine. Anyway, after that was
the second wave of idiots, the ones who were saying, 'Looks like
Harry Potter was just another do-gooder after all.'"</p>
<p>"And then?" Harry said, smiling even though he had no idea why
<em>that</em> was stupid.</p>
<p>"And then the actual smart people started talking. It's obvious
that you found a way to put a <em>lot</em> of pressure on Snape.
And while that could be more than one thing... the obvious
<em>next</em> thought is that it has something to do with Snape's
unknown hold over Dumbledore. Am I right?"</p>
<p>"No comment," Harry said. At least his brain was processing this
part correctly. House Slytherin <em>had</em> wondered why Severus
wasn't getting fired. And they'd concluded that Severus was
blackmailing Dumbledore. Could that actually be true...? But
Dumbledore hadn't seemed to act like it...</p>
<p>Draco went on talking. "And the <em>next</em> thing the smart
people pointed out was that if you could put enough pressure on
Snape to make him leave half of Hogwarts alone, that meant you
probably had enough power to get rid of him entirely, if you
wanted. What you did to him was a humiliation, just the same way he
tried to humiliate you - but you left us our Head of House."</p>
<p>Harry made his smile wider.</p>
<p>"And then the <em>really</em> smart people," Draco said, his
face now serious, "went off and had a little discussion by
themselves, and someone pointed out that it would be a very stupid
thing to leave an enemy around like that. If you could break his
hold over Dumbledore, the obvious thing would be to just do it.
Dumbledore would kick Snape out of Hogwarts and maybe even have him
killed, he'd be <em>very</em> grateful to you, and you wouldn't
have to worry about Snape sneaking into your dorm room at night
with interesting potions."</p>
<p>Harry's face was now neutral. He had not thought of that and he
really, really should have. "And from this you concluded...?"</p>
<p>"Snape's hold was some secret of Dumbledore's and <em>you've got
the secret!</em> " Draco was looking exultant. "It can't be
powerful enough to destroy Dumbledore entirely, or Snape would have
used it by now. Snape refuses to use his hold for anything except
staying king of Slytherin House in Hogwarts, and he doesn't always
get what he wants even then, so it must have limits. But it's
<em>got</em> to be really good! Father's been trying to get Snape
to tell him for <em>years!</em> "</p>
<p>"And," Harry said, "now Lucius thinks maybe <em>I</em> can tell
him. Did you already get an owl -"</p>
<p>"I will tonight," Draco said, and laughed. "It will say," his
voice took on a different, more formal cadence, "<em>My beloved
son: I've already told you of Harry Potter's potential importance.
As you have already realized, his importance has now become greater
and more urgent. If you see any possible avenue of friendship or
point of pressure with him, you must pursue it, and the full
resources of Malfoy are at your disposal if needed.</em>"</p>
<p>Gosh. "Well," Harry said, "not commenting on whether or not your
whole complicated edifice of theory is true, let me just say that
we are not quite such good friends as yet."</p>
<p>"I know," Draco said. Then his face turned <em>very</em>
serious, and his voice grew quiet even within the blur. "Harry, has
it occurred to you that if you know something Dumbledore doesn't
want known, Dumbledore might simply have you killed? And it would
turn the Boy-Who-Lived from a potential competing leader into a
valuable martyr, too."</p>
<p>"No comment," Harry said yet again. He hadn't thought of that
last part, either. Didn't <em>seem</em> to be Dumbledore's style...
but...</p>
<p>"Harry," Draco said, "you've obviously got <em>incredible</em>
talent, but you've got no training and no mentors and you do stupid
things sometimes and <em>you really need an advisor who knows how
to do this or you're going to get hurt!</em> " Draco's face was
fierce.</p>
<p>"Ah," Harry said. "An advisor like Lucius?"</p>
<p>"Like <em>me!</em> " said Draco. "I'll promise to keep your
secrets from Father, from <em>everyone,</em> I'll just help you
figure out whatever you want to do!"</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Harry saw that zombie-Quirrell was staggering in through the
doors.</p>
<p>"Class is about to start," said Harry. "I'll think about what
you said, there's lots of times I <em>do</em> wish I had all your
training, it's just I don't know how I can trust you so quickly
-"</p>
<p>"You shouldn't," Draco said, "it's too soon. See? I'll give you
good advice even if it hurts me. But we should maybe <em>hurry
up</em> and become closer friends."</p>
<p>"I'm open to that," said Harry, who was already trying to figure
out how to exploit it.</p>
<p>"Another bit of advice," Draco said hurriedly as Quirrell
slouched toward his desk, "right now everyone in Slytherin's
wondering about you, so if you're courting us, which I think you
are, you should do something that signals friendship to Slytherin.
<em>Soon</em>, like today or tomorrow."</p>
<p>"Letting Severus go on awarding extra House points to Slytherin
wasn't enough?" No reason Harry couldn't take credit for it.</p>
<p>Draco's eyes flickered with realization, then he said rapidly,
"It's not the same, trust me, it's got to be something obvious.
Push your mudblood rival Granger into a wall or something, everyone
in Slytherin will know what that means -"</p>
<p>"That is <em>not</em> how it works in Ravenclaw, Draco! If you
have to push someone into a wall it means your brain is too
<em>weak</em> to beat them the right way and everyone in Ravenclaw
<em>knows that</em> -"</p>
<p>The screen on Harry's desk flickered on, provoking a sudden wash
of nostalgia for television and computers.</p>
<p>"Ahem," said Professor Quirrell's voice, seeming to speak
personally to Harry out of the screen. "Please take your
seats."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>And the children were all seated and staring at the repeater
screens on their desks, or looking down directly at the great white
marble stage where Professor Quirrell stood, leaning on his desk
atop the small dais of darker marble.</p>
<p>"Today," said Professor Quirrell, "I had planned to teach you
your first defensive spell, a small shield that was the ancestor of
today's <em>Protego.</em> But on second thought I have changed
today's lesson plan in the light of recent events."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's gaze searched the rows of seats. Harry
winced from where he was sitting, in the back row. He had a feeling
he knew who was about to be called on.</p>
<p>"Draco, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy," said
Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>Whew.</p>
<p>"Yes, Professor?" said Draco. His voice was amplified, seeming
to come from the repeater screen on Harry's desk, which showed
Draco's face as he spoke. Then the screen shifted back to Professor
Quirrell, who said:</p>
<p>"Is it your ambition to become the next Dark Lord?"</p>
<p>"That's an odd question, Professor," said Draco. "I mean, who'd
be dumb enough to admit it?"</p>
<p>A few students laughed, but not many.</p>
<p>"Indeed," said Professor Quirrell. "So while there's no point in
asking any of you, it would not surprise me in the slightest if
there were a student or two in my classes who harbored ambitions of
being the next Dark Lord. After all, <em>I</em> wanted to be the
next Dark Lord when <em>I</em> was a young Slytherin."</p>
<p>This time the laughter was much more widespread.</p>
<p>"Well, it <em>is</em> the House of the ambitious, after all,"
Professor Quirrell said, smiling. "I didn't realize until later
that what I really enjoyed was Battle Magic, and that my true
ambition was to become a great fighting wizard and someday teach at
Hogwarts. In any case, when I was thirteen years old, I read
through the historical sections of the Hogwarts library,
scrutinizing the lives and fates of past Dark Lords, and I made a
list of all the mistakes that <em>I</em> would never make when
<em>I</em> was a Dark Lord -"</p>
<p>Harry giggled before he could stop himself.</p>
<p>"Yes, Mr. Potter, very amusing. So, Mr. Potter, can you guess
what was the very first item on that list?"</p>
<p><em>Great.</em> "Um... never use a complicated way of dealing
with an enemy when you can just Abracadabra them?"</p>
<p>"The <em>term,</em> Mr. Potter, is <em>Avada Kedavra,</em>"
Professor Quirrell's voice sounded a bit sharp for some reason,
"and no, that was <em>not</em> on the list I made at age thirteen.
Would you care to guess again?"</p>
<p>"Ah... never brag to anyone about your evil master plan?"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell laughed. "Ah, now <em>that</em> was number
two. My, Mr. Potter, have we been reading the same books?"</p>
<p>There was more laughter, with an undertone of nervousness. Harry
clenched his jaw tightly shut and said nothing. A denial would
accomplish nothing.</p>
<p>"But no. The <em>first</em> item was, 'I will not go around
provoking strong, vicious enemies.' The history of the world would
be very different if Mornelithe Falconsbane or Hitler had grasped
that elementary point. Now <em>if,</em> Mr. Potter - just
<em>if</em> by some chance you harbor an ambition similar to the
one I held as a young Slytherin - even so, I hope it is not your
ambition to become a <em>stupid</em> Dark Lord."</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell," Harry said, gritting his teeth, "I am a
<em>Ravenclaw</em> and it is not my ambition to be stupid, period.
I know that what I did today was dumb. But it wasn't <em>Dark!</em>
I was <em>not</em> the one who threw the first punch in that
fight!"</p>
<p>"You, Mr. Potter, are an idiot. But then so was I at your age.
Thus I anticipated your answer and altered today's lesson plan
accordingly. Mr. Gregory Goyle, if you would come forward,
please?"</p>
<p>There was a surprised pause in the classroom. Harry hadn't been
expecting that.</p>
<p>Neither, from the looks of it, had Mr. Goyle, who looked rather
uncertain and worried as he mounted the marble stage and approached
the dais.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell straightened from where he was leaning on the
desk. He looked suddenly stronger, and his hands formed fists and
he drew himself up into a clearly recognizable martial arts
stance.</p>
<p>Harry's eyes widened at the sight, and he realized why Mr. Goyle
had been called up.</p>
<p>"Most wizards," Professor Quirrell said, "do not bother much
with what a Muggle would term martial arts. Is not a wand stronger
than a fist? This attitude is stupid. Wands are held in fists. If
you want to be a great fighting wizard you <em>must</em> learn
martial arts to a level which would impress even a Muggle. I will
now demonstrate a certain vitally important technique, which I
learned in a <em>dojo,</em> a Muggle school of martial arts, of
which I shall speak more shortly. For now..." Professor Quirrell
took several steps forward, still in stance, advancing on where Mr.
Goyle stood. "Mr. Goyle, I will ask you to attack me."</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell," said Mr. Goyle, his voice now amplified as
the professor's was, "can I ask what level -"</p>
<p>"Sixth <em>dan</em>. You will not be hurt and neither will I.
And if you see an opening, please take it."</p>
<p>Mr. Goyle nodded, looking much relieved.</p>
<p>"Note," Professor Quirrell said, "that Mr. Goyle was afraid to
attack someone who did not know martial arts to an acceptable
level, for fear that I, or he, would be hurt. Mr. Goyle's attitude
is exactly correct and he has earned three Quirrell points for it.
Now, fight!"</p>
<p>The young boy blurred forward, fists flying, and the Professor
blocked every blow, dancing backward, Quirrell kicked and Goyle
blocked and spun and tried to trip Quirrell with a sweeping leg and
Quirrell hopped over it and it was all happening too fast for Harry
to make sense of what was going on and then Goyle was on his back
with his legs pushing and Quirrell was actually <em>flying through
the air</em> and then he hit the ground shoulder first and
rolled.</p>
<p>"Stop!" cried Professor Quirrell from the ground, sounding a
little panicked. "You win!"</p>
<p>Mr. Goyle pulled up so sharply he staggered, almost tripping and
falling from the aborted momentum of his headlong charge toward
Professor Quirrell. His face showed utter shock.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell arched his back and bounced to his feet using
a peculiar springing motion that made no use of his hands.</p>
<p>There was a silence in the classroom, a silence born of total
confusion.</p>
<p>"Mr. Goyle," said Professor Quirrell, "what vitally important
technique did I demonstrate?"</p>
<p>"How to fall correctly when someone throws you," said Mr. Goyle.
"It's one of the very first lessons you learn -"</p>
<p>"That too," said Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>"The vitally important technique which I demonstrated," said
Professor Quirrell, "was how to lose. You may go, Mr. Goyle, thank
you."</p>
<p>Mr. Goyle walked off the platform, looking rather bewildered.
Harry felt the same way.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell walked back to his desk and resumed leaning
on it. "Sometimes we forget the most basic things, since it has
been too long since we learned them. I realized I had done the same
with my own lesson plan. You do not teach students to throw until
you have taught them to fall. And I must not teach you to fight if
you do not understand how to lose."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's face hardened, and Harry thought he saw a
hint of pain, a touch of sorrow, in those eyes. "I learned how to
lose in a <em>dojo</em> in Asia, which, as any Muggle knows, is
where all the good martial artists live. This <em>dojo</em> taught
a style which had a reputation among fighting wizards as adapting
well to magical dueling. The Master of that <em>dojo</em> - an old
man by Muggle standards - was that style's greatest living teacher.
He had no idea that magic existed, of course. I applied to study
there, and was one of the few students accepted that year, from
among many contenders. There might have been a tiny bit of special
influence involved."</p>
<p>There was some laughter in the classroom. Harry didn't share it.
That hadn't been right at all.</p>
<p>"In any case. During one of my first fights, after I had been
beaten in a particularly humiliating fashion, I lost control and
attacked my sparring partner -"</p>
<p><em>Yikes.</em></p>
<p>"- thankfully with my fists, rather than my magic. The Master,
surprisingly, did not expel me on the spot. But he told me that
there was a flaw in my temperament. He explained it to me, and I
knew that he was right. And then he said that I would learn how to
lose."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's face was expressionless.</p>
<p>"Upon his strict orders, all of the students of the
<em>dojo</em> lined up. One by one, they approached me. I was
<em>not</em> to defend myself. I was only to beg for mercy. One by
one, they slapped me, or punched me, and pushed me to the ground.
Some of them spat on me. They called me awful names in their
language. And to each one, I had to say, 'I lose!' and similar such
things, such as 'I beg you to stop!' and 'I admit you're better
than me!'"</p>
<p>Harry was trying to imagine this and simply failing. There was
no way something like that could have happened to the dignified
Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>"I was a prodigy of Battle Magic even then. With wandless magic
alone I could have killed everyone in that dojo. I did not do so. I
learned to lose. To this day I remember it as one of the most
unpleasant hours of my life. And when I left that dojo eight months
later - which was not nearly enough time, but was all I could
afford to spend - the Master told me that he hoped I understood why
that had been necessary. And I told him that it was one of the most
valuable lessons I had ever learned. Which was, and is, true."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's face turned bitter. "You are wondering
where this marvelous <em>dojo</em> is, and whether you can study
there. You cannot. For not long afterward, another would-be student
came to that hidden place, to that remote mountain.
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named."</p>
<p>There was the sound of many breaths being drawn in
simultaneously. Harry felt sick to his stomach. He knew what was
coming.</p>
<p>"The Dark Lord came to that school openly, without disguise,
glowing red eyes and all. The students tried to bar his way and he
simply Apparated through. There was terror there, but discipline,
and the Master came forth. And the Dark Lord demanded - not asked,
but demanded - to be taught."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's face was very hard. "Perhaps the Master had
read too many books telling the lie that a true martial artist
could defeat even demons. For whatever reason, the Master refused.
The Dark Lord asked why he could not be a student. The Master told
him he had no patience, and that was when the Dark Lord ripped his
tongue out."</p>
<p>There was a collective gasp.</p>
<p>"You can guess what happened next. The students tried to rush
the Dark Lord and fell over, stunned where they stood. And
then..."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's voice faltered for a moment, then
resumed.</p>
<p>"There is an Unforgiveable Curse, the Cruciatus Curse, which
produces unbearable pain. If the Cruciatus is extended for longer
than a few minutes it produces permanent insanity. One by one, the
Dark Lord Crucioed the Master's students into insanity, and then
finished them off with the Killing Curse, while the Master was
forced to watch. When all his students had died in this way, the
Master followed. I learned this from the single surviving student,
whom the Dark Lord had left alive to tell the tale, and who had
been a friend of mine..."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell turned away, and when he turned back a moment
later, he once again seemed calm and composed.</p>
<p>"Dark Wizards cannot keep their tempers," Professor Quirrell
said quietly. "It is a nearly universal flaw of the species, and
anyone who makes a habit of fighting them soon learns to rely on
it. Understand that the Dark Lord did <em>not</em> win that day.
His goal was to learn martial arts, and yet he left without a
single lesson. The Dark Lord was foolish to wish that story retold.
It did not show his strength, but rather an exploitable
weakness."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's gaze focused on a single child in the
classroom.</p>
<p>"Harry Potter," Professor Quirrell said.</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said, his voice hoarse.</p>
<p>"What <em>precisely</em> did you do wrong today, Mr.
Potter?"</p>
<p>Harry felt like he was going to throw up. "I lost my
temper."</p>
<p>"That is <em>not</em> precise," said Professor Quirrell. "I will
describe it more exactly. There are many animals which have what
are called dominance contests. They rush at each other with horns -
trying to knock each other down, not gore each other. They fight
with their paws - with claws sheathed. But why with their claws
sheathed? Surely, if they used their claws, they would stand a
better chance of winning? But then their enemy might unsheathe
their claws as well, and instead of resolving the dominance contest
with a winner and a loser, both of them might be severely
hurt."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell gaze seemed to come straight out at Harry
from the repeater screen. "What you demonstrated today, Mr. Potter,
is that - unlike those animals who keep their claws sheathed and
accept the results - you do not know how to lose a dominance
contest. When a <em>Hogwarts professor</em> challenged you, you did
not back down. When it looked like you might lose, you unsheathed
your claws, heedless of the danger. You <em>escalated,</em> and
then you escalated <em>again.</em> It started with a slap at you
from Professor Snape, who was obviously dominant over you. Instead
of losing, you slapped back and lost ten points from Ravenclaw.
Soon you were talking about leaving Hogwarts. The fact that you
escalated even further in some unknown direction, and somehow won
at the end, does not change the fact that you are an idiot."</p>
<p>"I understand," Harry said. His throat was dry. That
<em>had</em> been precise. <em>Frighteningly</em> precise. Now that
Professor Quirrell had said it, Harry could see in hindsight that
it was an <em>exactly</em> accurate description of what had
happened. When someone's model of you was that good, you had to
wonder whether they were right about other things too, like your
intent to kill.</p>
<p>"The <em>next</em> time, Mr. Potter, that you choose to escalate
a contest rather than lose, you may lose <em>all</em> the stakes
you place on the table. I cannot guess what they were today. I can
guess that they were far, far too high for the loss of ten House
points."</p>
<p>Like the fate of magical Britain. That was what he'd done.</p>
<p>''You will protest that you were trying to help all of Hogwarts,
a much more important goal worthy of great risks. That is a
<em>lie.</em> If you had been -"</p>
<p>"I would have taken the slap, waited, and picked the best
possible time to make my move," Harry said, his voice hoarse. "But
that would have meant <em>losing</em>. Letting him be dominant over
me. It was what the Dark Lord couldn't do with the Master he wanted
to learn from."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell nodded. "I see that you have understood
perfectly. And so, Mr. Potter, today you are going to learn how to
lose."</p>
<p>"I -"</p>
<p>"I will not hear any objections, Mr. Potter. It is evident both
that you need this and that you are strong enough to take it. I
assure you that your experience will not be so harsh as what I went
through, though you may well remember it as the worst fifteen
minutes of your young life."</p>
<p>Harry swallowed. "Professor Quirrell," he said in a small voice,
"can we do this some other time?"</p>
<p>"No," Professor Quirrell said simply. "You are five days into
your Hogwarts education and already this has happened. Today is
Friday. Our <em>next</em> defense class is on Wednesday. Saturday,
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday... No, we do <em>not</em> have
time to wait."</p>
<p>There were a few laughs at this, but very few.</p>
<p>"Please consider it an order from your professor, Mr. Potter.
What I would like to say is that otherwise I will not teach you any
offensive spells, because I would then hear that you had severely
hurt or even killed someone. Unfortunately I am told that your
fingers are already powerful weapons. Do not snap them at any time
during this lesson."</p>
<p>More scattered laughter, sounding rather nervous.</p>
<p>Harry felt like he might cry. "Professor Quirrell, if you do
anything like what you talked about, it's going to make me angry,
and I really would rather not get angry again today -"</p>
<p>"The point is <em>not</em> to avoid getting angry," Professor
Quirrell said, his face looking grave. "Anger is natural. You need
to learn how to lose even when you are angry. Or at least
<em>pretend</em> to lose so that you can <em>plan</em> your
vengeance. As I did with Mr. Goyle today, unless of course any of
you think he really <em>is</em> better -"</p>
<p>"I'm not!" shouted Mr. Goyle from his desk, sounding a little
frantic. "I know you didn't really lose! Please don't plan any
vengeances!"</p>
<p>Harry felt sick to his stomach. Professor Quirrell didn't know
about his mysterious dark side. "Professor, we really need to talk
about this after class -"</p>
<p>"We will," Professor Quirrell said in the tones of a promise.
"After you learn how to lose." His face was serious. "It should go
without saying that I will exclude anything which could injure you
or even cause you significant pain. The pain will come from the
difficulty of losing, instead of fighting back and escalating the
battle until you win."</p>
<p>Harry's breath was coming in short, panicky pants. He was more
frightened than he'd been after leaving the Potions classroom.
"Professor Quirrell," he managed to say, "I don't want you to get
fired over this -"</p>
<p>"I will not be," Professor Quirrell said, "if <em>you</em> tell
them afterward that it was necessary. And this I trust you to do."
For a moment Professor Quirrell's voice turned very dry. "Believe
me, they have tolerated worse in their hallways. This case will be
exceptional only in that it happens within a classroom."</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell," Harry whispered, but he thought his voice
was still being repeated everywhere, "do you really believe that if
I don't do this, I might hurt someone?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Professor Quirrell said simply.</p>
<p>"Then," Harry felt nauseous, "I'll do it."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell turned to regard the Slytherins. "So... with
the full approval of your teacher, and in such a fashion that Snape
cannot be blamed for your actions... do any of you wish to show
your dominance over the Boy-Who-Lived? Shove him around, push him
to the ground, hear him beg for your mercy?"</p>
<p>Five hands went up.</p>
<p>"Everyone with your hand raised, you are an absolute idiot. What
part of <em>pretending</em> to lose did you not understand? If
Harry Potter does become the next Dark Lord he will hunt you down
and kill you after he graduates."</p>
<p>The five hands dropped abruptly back to their desks.</p>
<p>"I won't," Harry said, his voice coming out rather weakly. "I
swear never to take vengeance upon those who help me learn to lose.
Professor Quirrell... would you <em>please</em>... <em>stop</em>
that?"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell sighed. "I <em>am</em> sorry, Mr. Potter. I
realize that you must find this equally annoying whether you intend
to become a Dark Lord or not. But those children <em>also</em> had
an important life lesson to learn. Would it be acceptable if I
awarded you a Quirrell point in apology?"</p>
<p>"Make it two," Harry said.</p>
<p>There was a current of surprised laughter, defusing some of the
tension.</p>
<p>"Done," Professor Quirrell said.</p>
<p>"And after I graduate I'm going to hunt you down and
<em>tickle</em> you."</p>
<p>There was more laughter, although Professor Quirrell didn't
smile.</p>
<p>Harry felt like he was wrestling an anaconda, trying to force
the conversation through the narrow course that would make people
realize he wasn't a Dark Lord after all... <em>why</em> was
Professor Quirrell so suspicious of him?</p>
<p>"Professor," said Draco's unamplified voice. "It is also not my
own ambition to become a stupid Dark Lord."</p>
<p>There was a shocked silence in the classroom.</p>
<p><em>You don't have to do this!</em> Harry almost blurted out
loud, but checked himself in time; Draco might not wish it known
that he was doing this out of friendship for Harry... or out of the
desire to appear friendly...</p>
<p>Calling <em>that</em> a <em>desire to appear friendly</em> made
Harry feel small, and mean. If Draco had intended to impress him,
it was working perfectly.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was regarding Draco gravely. "<em>You</em>
worry that you cannot pretend to lose, Mr. Malfoy? That this flaw
which describes Mr. Potter also describes you? <em>Surely</em> your
father taught you better."</p>
<p>"When it comes to talking, maybe," said Draco, now on the
repeater screen. "Not when it comes to being shoved around and
pushed to the ground. I want to be fully as strong as you,
Professor Quirrell."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's eyebrows went up and stayed up. "I am
afraid, Mr. Malfoy," he said after a time, "that the arrangements I
made for Mr. Potter, involving some older Slytherins who will be
told <em>afterward</em> how stupid they were, would not carry over
onto you. But it is my professional opinion that you are already
very strong. Should I hear that you have failed, as Mr. Potter
failed today, I will make the appropriate arrangements and
apologize to you and whomever you have hurt. I do not think this
will be necessary, however."</p>
<p>"I understand, professor," said Draco.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell looked over the class. "Does anyone else wish
to become strong?"</p>
<p>Some students glanced around nervously. Some, Harry thought from
his back row, looked like they were opening their mouths but not
saying anything. In the end, no one spoke.</p>
<p>"Draco Malfoy will be one of the generals of your year's
armies," said Professor Quirrell, "should he deign to engage in
that after-school activity. And now, Mr. Potter, please come
forward."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Yes,</em> Professor Quirrell had said, <em>it must be in
front of everyone, in front of your friends, because that is where
Snape confronted you and that is where you must learn to
lose.</em></p>
<p>So now the first year watched. In magically enforced silence,
and with requests from both Harry and the professor not to
intervene. Hermione had her face turned away, but she hadn't spoken
out or even given him any sort of significant look, maybe because
she'd been there in Potions too.</p>
<p>Harry stood on a soft blue mat, such as might be found in a
Muggle dojo, which Professor Quirrell had laid out upon the floor
for when Harry was pushed down.</p>
<p>Harry was frightened of what he might do. If Professor Quirrell
was right about his intent to kill...</p>
<p>Harry's wand lay on Professor Quirrell's desk, not because Harry
knew any spells that could defend him, but because otherwise (Harry
thought) he might have tried to jam it through someone's eye
socket. His pouch lay there, now containing his protected but still
potentially fragile Time-Turner.</p>
<p>Harry had pleaded with Professor Quirrell to Transfigure him
some boxing gloves and lock them on his hands. Professor Quirrell
had given him a look of silent understanding, and refused.</p>
<p><em>I will not go for their eyes, I will not go for their eyes,
I will not go for their eyes, it would be the end of my life in
Hogwarts, I'll be arrested,</em> Harry chanted to himself, trying
to hammer the thought into his brain, hoping it would stay there if
his intent to kill took over.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell returned, escorting thirteen older Slytherins
of different years. Harry recognized one of them as the one he'd
hit with a pie. Two others from that confrontation were also
present. The one who'd said to stop, that they really shouldn't do
this, was missing.</p>
<p>"I repeat," Professor Quirrell said, sounding very stern,
"Potter is <em>not</em> to be really hurt. Any and all
<em>accidents</em> will be treated as deliberate. Do you
understand?"</p>
<p>The older Slytherins nodded, grinning.</p>
<p>"Then please feel free to take the Boy-Who-Lived down a few
pegs," Professor Quirrell said, with a twisted smile that only the
first-years understood.</p>
<p>By some form of mutual consent, the pie-target was at the front
of the group.</p>
<p>"Potter," said Professor Quirrell, "meet Mr. Peregrine Derrick.
He is better than you and he is about to show you that."</p>
<p>Derrick strode forward and Harry's brain screamed discordantly,
he must not run away, he must not fight back -</p>
<p>Derrick stopped an arm's length away from Harry.</p>
<p>Harry wasn't angry yet, just frightened. And that meant he
beheld a teenage boy fully half a meter taller than himself, with
clearly defined muscles, facial hair, and a grin of terrible
anticipation.</p>
<p>"Ask him not to hurt you," Professor Quirrell said. "Perhaps if
he sees that you're pathetic enough, he'll decide that you're
boring, and go away."</p>
<p>There was laughter from the watching older Slytherins.</p>
<p>"Please," Harry said, his voice faltering, "don't, hurt,
me..."</p>
<p>"That didn't sound very sincere," said Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>Derrick's smile widened. The clumsy imbecile was looking very
superior and...</p>
<p>...Harry's blood temperature was dropping...</p>
<p>"Please don't hurt me," Harry tried again.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell shook his head. "How in Merlin's name did you
manage to make that sound like an insult, Potter? There is only one
response you can possibly expect from Mr. Derrick."</p>
<p>Derrick stepped forward deliberately, and bumped into Harry.</p>
<p>Harry staggered back a few feet and, before he could stop
himself, straightened up icily.</p>
<p>"Wrong," said Professor Quirrell, "wrong, wrong, wrong."</p>
<p>"You bumped into me, Potter," Derrick said. "Apologize."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry!"</p>
<p>"You don't <em>sound</em> sorry," said Derrick.</p>
<p>Harry's eyes widened in indignation, he <em>had</em> managed to
make that sound pleading -</p>
<p>Derrick pushed him, hard, and Harry fell to the mat on his hands
and knees.</p>
<p>The blue fabric seemed to waver in Harry's vision, not far
away.</p>
<p>He was beginning to doubt Professor Quirrell's real motives in
teaching this so-called <em>lesson.</em></p>
<p>A foot rested on Harry's buttocks and a moment later Harry was
pushed hard to the side, sending him sprawling on his back.</p>
<p>Derrick laughed. "This is <em>fun,</em>" he said.</p>
<p>All he had to do was say it was over. And report the whole thing
to the Headmaster's office. That would be the end of this
<em>Defense Professor</em> and his ill-fated stay at Hogwarts
and... Professor McGonagall would be angry about that, but...</p>
<p>(An image of Professor McGonagall's face flashed before his
eyes, she didn't look angry, just sad -)</p>
<p>"Now tell him that he's better than you, Potter," said Professor
Quirrell's voice.</p>
<p>"You're, better, than, me."</p>
<p>Harry started to raise himself and Derrick put a foot on his
chest and shoved him back down to the mat.</p>
<p>The world was becoming transparent as crystal. Lines of action
and their consequences stretched out before him in utter clarity.
The fool wouldn't be expecting him to strike back, a quick hit in
the groin would stun him long enough for -</p>
<p>"Try again," said Professor Quirrell and with a sudden sharp
motion Harry rolled and sprang to his feet and whirled on where
stood his real enemy, the Defense Professor -</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell said, "You have no patience."</p>
<p>Harry faltered. His mind, well-honed in pessimism, drew a
picture of a wizened old man with blood pouring from his mouth
after Harry had ripped his tongue out -</p>
<p>A moment later, Derrick pushed Harry to the mat again and then
sat down on him, sending Harry's breath whooshing out.</p>
<p>"Stop!" Harry screamed. "Please stop!"</p>
<p>"Better," said Professor Quirrell. "That even sounded
sincere."</p>
<p>It <em>had</em> been. That was the horrible thing, the sickening
thing, it <em>had</em> been sincere. Harry was panting rapidly,
fear and cold anger both flushing through him -</p>
<p>"Lose," said Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>"I, lose," Harry forced out.</p>
<p>"I like it," Derrick said from on top of him. "Lose some
more."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Hands shoved Harry, sending him stumbling across the circle of
older Slytherins to another set of hands that shoved him again.
Harry had long since passed the point of trying not to cry, and was
now just trying not to fall down.</p>
<p>"What are you, Potter?" said Derrick.</p>
<p>"A, l-loser, I lose, I give up, you win, you're b-better, than
me, please stop -"</p>
<p>Harry tripped over a foot and went crashing to the ground, hands
not quite able to catch himself. He was dazed for a moment, then
began struggling to his feet again -</p>
<p>"<em>Enough!</em> " said Professor Quirrell's voice, sounding
sharp enough to cut iron. "Step away from Mr. Potter!"</p>
<p>Harry saw the surprised looks on their faces. The chill in his
blood, which had been flowing and ebbing, smiled in cold
satisfaction.</p>
<p>Then Harry collapsed to the mat.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell talked. There were gasps from the older
Slytherins.</p>
<p>"And I believe the scion of Malfoy has something he wants to
explain to you as well," finished Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>Draco's voice started talking. His voice sounded almost as sharp
as professor Quirrell's, it had acquired the same cadence Draco had
used to imitate his father, and it was saying things like <em>could
have put Slytherin House in jeopardy</em> and <em>who knows how
many allies in this school alone</em> and <em>total lack of
awareness, never mind cunning</em> and <em>dull thugs, useful for
nothing but lackeys</em> and something in Harry's hindbrain,
despite everything he knew, was designating Draco as an ally.</p>
<p>Harry ached all over, was probably bruised, his body felt cold,
his mind utterly exhausted. He tried to think of Fawkes's song, but
without the phoenix present he couldn't remember the melody and
when he tried to imagine it he couldn't seem to think of anything
except a bird chirping.</p>
<p>Then Draco stopped talking and Professor Quirrell told the older
Slytherins they were dismissed, and Harry opened his eyes and
struggled to sit up, "Wait," Harry said, forcing the words out,
"there's something, I want, to say, to them -"</p>
<p>"Wait on Mr. Potter," Professor Quirrell said coldly to the
departing Slytherins.</p>
<p>Harry swayed to his feet. He was careful not to look in the
direction of his classmates. He didn't want to see how they were
looking at him now. He didn't want to see their pity.</p>
<p>So instead Harry looked at the older Slytherins, who still
seemed to be in a state of shock. They stared back at him. Dread
was on their faces.</p>
<p>His dark side, when it was in control, had held to the
imagination of this moment, and went on pretending to lose.</p>
<p>Harry said, "No one will -"</p>
<p>"Stop," said Professor Quirrell. "If that's what I think it is,
please wait until after they're gone. They'll hear about it later.
We all have our lessons to learn, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>"All right," Harry said.</p>
<p>"You. Go."</p>
<p>The older Slytherins fled and the door closed behind them.</p>
<p>"No one's to take any revenge on them," Harry said hoarsely.
"That's a request to anyone who considers themselves my friend. I
had my lesson to learn, they helped me learn it, they had their
lesson to learn too, it's over. If you tell this story, make sure
you tell that part too."</p>
<p>Harry turned to look at Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>"You lost," said Professor Quirrell, his voice gentle for the
first time. It sounded strange coming from the professor, like his
voice shouldn't even be able to do that.</p>
<p>Harry <em>had</em> lost. There had been moments when the cold
anger had faded entirely, replaced by fear, and during those
moments he'd begged the older Slytherins and he'd meant it...</p>
<p>"And are you yet alive?" said Professor Quirrell, still with
that strange gentleness.</p>
<p>Harry managed to nod.</p>
<p>"Not all losing is like this," said Professor Quirrell. "There
are compromises and negotiated surrenders. There are other ways to
placate bullies. There is a whole art form to manipulating others
by letting them be dominant over you. But first, losing must be
<em>thinkable</em>. Will you remember how you lost?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Will you be able to lose?"</p>
<p>"I... think so..."</p>
<p>"I think so too." Professor Quirrell bowed so low that his thin
hair almost touched the floor. "Congratulations, Harry Potter, you
win."</p>
<p>There was no single source, no first mover, the applause started
all at once like a massive thunderclap.</p>
<p>Harry's couldn't keep the shock from his face. He risked a
glance at his classmates, and he saw their faces showing not pity
but awe. The applause was coming from Ravenclaw and Gryffindor and
Hufflepuff and even Slytherin, probably because Draco Malfoy was
applauding too. Some students were standing up from their chairs
and half of Gryffindor was standing on their desks.</p>
<p>So Harry stood there, swaying, letting their respect wash over
him, feeling stronger, and maybe even a little healed.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell waited for the applause to die away. It took
quite a while.</p>
<p>"Surprised, Mr. Potter?" Professor Quirrell said. His voice
sounded amused. "You have just found out that the real world does
not <em>always</em> work like your worst nightmares. Yes, if you
had been some poor anonymous boy being abused, then they would
probably have respected you less afterward, pitied you even as they
comforted you from their loftier perches. That <em>is</em> human
nature, I'm afraid. But <em>you</em> they already know for a figure
of power. And they saw you confront your fear and keep confronting
it, even though you could have walked away at any time. Did you
think less of <em>me</em> when I told you that I had deliberately
endured being spat upon?"</p>
<p>Harry felt a burning sensation in his throat and frantically
clamped down. He didn't trust this miraculous respect enough to
start crying again in front of it.</p>
<p>"Your <em>extraordinary</em> achievement in my class deserves an
extraordinary reward, Harry Potter. Please accept it with my
compliments on behalf of my House, and remember from this day
forward that not all Slytherins are alike. There are Slytherins,
and then there are Slytherins." Professor Quirrell was smiling
quite broadly as he said this. "Fifty-one points to Ravenclaw."</p>
<p>There was a shocked pause and then pandemonium broke out among
the Ravenclaw students, howling and whistling and cheering.</p>
<p>(And in the same moment Harry felt something <em>wrong</em>
about that, Professor McGonagall had been right, there
<em>should</em> have been consequences, there should have been a
cost and a price to be paid, you couldn't just put everything back
the way it was like that -)</p>
<p>But Harry saw the elated faces in Ravenclaw and knew he couldn't
possibly say no.</p>
<p>His brain made a suggestion. It was a good suggestion. Harry
could not even believe his brain was still keeping him upright, let
alone producing good suggestions.</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell," Harry said, as clearly as he could through
his burning throat. "You are everything a member of your House
should be, and I think you must be just what Salazar Slytherin had
in mind when he helped found Hogwarts. I thank you and your House,"
Draco was very slightly nodding and subtly turning his finger,
<em>keep going</em>, "and I think this calls for three cheers for
Slytherin. With me, everyone?" Harry paused. "<em>Huzzah!</em> "
Only a few people managed to join in on the first try.
"<em>Huzzah!</em> " This time most of Ravenclaw was in on it.
"<em>Huzzah!</em> " That was almost all of Ravenclaw, a scattering
of Hufflepuffs and around a quarter of Gryffindor.</p>
<p>Draco's hand moved into a small, quick, thumbs-up gesture.</p>
<p>Most of the Slytherins had expressions of sheer shock. A few
were staring at Professor Quirrell in wonder. Blaise Zabini was
looking at Harry with a calculating, intrigued expression.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell bowed. "Thank <em>you</em>, Harry Potter," he
said, still with that broad smile. He turned to the class. "Now,
believe it or not, we still have half an hour left in this session,
and that is enough to introduce the Simple Shield. Mr. Potter, of
course, is going off and taking a well-earned rest."</p>
<p>"I can -"</p>
<p>"Idiot," Professor Quirrell said fondly. The class was already
laughing. "Your classmates can teach you afterward, or I'll tutor
you privately if that's what it takes. But <em>right now</em>,
you're going through the third door from the left in the back of
the stage, where you will find a bed, an assortment of
exceptionally tasty snacks, and some extremely light reading from
the Hogwarts library. You may not take anything else with you,
particularly not your textbooks. Now go."</p>
<p>Harry went.</p>
</div>
<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 20: Bayes's Theorem<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>That which can be destroyed by the Rowling should be.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry stared up at the gray ceiling of the small room, from
where he lay on the portable yet soft bed that had been placed
there. He'd eaten quite a lot of Professor Quirrell's snacks -
intricate confections of chocolate and other substances, dusted
with sparkling sprinkles and jeweled with tiny sugar gems, looking
highly expensive and proving, in fact, to be quite tasty. Harry
hadn't felt the least bit guilty about it either, <em>this</em> he
had <em>earned</em>.</p>
<p>He hadn't tried to sleep. Harry had a feeling that he wouldn't
like what happened when he closed his eyes.</p>
<p>He hadn't tried to read. He wouldn't have been able to
focus.</p>
<p>Funny how Harry's brain just seemed to keep on running and
running, never shutting down no matter how tired it got. It got
stupider but it refused to <em>switch off.</em></p>
<p>But there was, there really and truly was a feeling of
triumph.</p>
<p>Anti-Dark-Lord-Harry program, +1 point didn't <em>begin</em> to
cover it. Harry wondered what the Sorting Hat would say
<em>now</em>, if he could put it on his head.</p>
<p>No <em>wonder</em> Professor Quirrell had accused Harry of
heading down the path of a Dark Lord. Harry had been too slow on
the uptake, he should have seen the parallel right away -</p>
<p><em>Understand that the Dark Lord did not win that day. His goal
was to learn martial arts, and yet he left without a single
lesson.</em></p>
<p>Harry had entered the Potions class with the intent to learn
Potions. He'd left without a single lesson.</p>
<p>And Professor Quirrell had heard, and understood with
frightening precision, and reached out and yanked Harry off that
path, the path that led to his becoming a copy of You-Know-Who.</p>
<p>There was a knock at the door. "Classes are over," said
Professor Quirrell's quiet voice.</p>
<p>Harry approached the door and found himself suddenly nervous.
Then the tension diminished as he heard Professor Quirrell's
footsteps moving away from the door.</p>
<p><em>What on Earth is that about? Is it what's going to get him
fired eventually?</em></p>
<p>Harry opened the door, and saw that Professor Quirrell was now
waiting several bodylengths away.</p>
<p><em>Does Professor Quirrell feel it too?</em></p>
<p>They walked across the now-deserted stage to Professor
Quirrell's desk, which Professor Quirrell leaned on; and Harry, as
before, stopped short of the dais.</p>
<p>"So," Professor Quirrell said. There was a friendly sense about
him somehow, even though his face still kept its usual seriousness.
"What was it you wanted to talk to me about, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p><em>I have a mysterious dark side.</em> But Harry couldn't just
blurt it out like that.</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell," Harry said, "am I off the path to becoming
a Dark Lord, now?"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell looked at Harry. "Mr. Potter," he said
solemnly, with only a slight grin, "a word of advice. There is such
a thing as a performance which is too perfect. Real people who have
just been beaten and humiliated for fifteen minutes do not stand up
and graciously forgive their enemies. It is the sort of thing you
do when you're trying to <em>convince</em> everyone you're not
Dark, not -"</p>
<p>"<em>I can't believe this! You can't have every possible
observation confirm your theory!</em> "</p>
<p>"And that was a <em>trifle</em> too much indignation."</p>
<p>"<em>What on Earth do I have to do to convince you?</em> "</p>
<p>"To convince me that you harbor no ambitions of becoming a Dark
Lord?" said Professor Quirrell, now looking outright amused. "I
suppose you could just raise your right hand."</p>
<p>"What?" Harry said blankly. "But I can raise my right hand
whether or not I -" Harry stopped, feeling rather stupid.</p>
<p>"Indeed," said Professor Quirrell. "You can just as easily do it
either way. There is nothing you can do to convince me because I
would know that was exactly what you were trying to do. And if we
are to be even more precise, then while I suppose it is barely
possible that perfectly good people exist even though I have never
met one, it is nonetheless <em>improbable</em> that someone would
be beaten for fifteen minutes and then stand up and feel a great
surge of kindly forgiveness for his attackers. On the other hand it
is <em>less</em> improbable that a young child would imagine this
as the <em>role to play</em> in order to convince his teacher and
classmates that he is not the next Dark Lord. The import of an act
lies not in what that act <em>resembles on the surface,</em> Mr.
Potter, but in the states of mind which make that act more or less
probable."</p>
<p>Harry blinked. He'd just had the dichotomy between the
representativeness heuristic and the Bayesian definition of
evidence explained to him by a wizard.</p>
<p>"But then again," said Professor Quirrell, "anyone can want to
impress their friends. That need not be Dark. So without it being
any kind of admission, Mr. Potter, tell me honestly. What thought
was in your mind at the moment when you forbade any vengeance? Was
that thought a true impulse to forgiveness? Or was it an awareness
of how your classmates would see the act?"</p>
<p><em>Sometimes we make our own phoenix song.</em></p>
<p>But Harry didn't say it out loud. It was clear that Professor
Quirrell wouldn't believe him, and would probably respect him less
for trying to utter such a transparent lie.</p>
<p>After a few moments of silence, Professor Quirrell smiled with
satisfaction. "Believe it or not, Mr. Potter," said the professor,
"you need not fear me for having discovered your secret. I am
<em>not</em> going to tell you to give up on becoming the next Dark
Lord. If I could turn back the hands of time and somehow remove
that ambition from the mind of my child self, the self of this
present time would not benefit from the alteration. For as long as
I thought that was my goal, it drove me to study and learn and
refine myself and become stronger. We become what we are meant to
be by following our desires wherever they lead. That is the insight
of Salazar. Ask me to show you to the library section which holds
those same books I read as a thirteen-year-old, and I will happily
lead the way."</p>
<p>"For the love of crap," Harry said, and sat down on the hard
marble floor, and then lay back on the floor, staring up at the
distant arches of the ceiling. It was as close as he could come to
collapsing in despair without hurting himself.</p>
<p>"Still too much indignation," observed Professor Quirrell. Harry
wasn't looking but he could hear the suppressed laughter in the
voice.</p>
<p>Then Harry realized.</p>
<p>"Actually, I think I know what's confusing you here," Harry
said. "That was what I wanted to talk to you about, in fact.
Professor Quirrell, I think that what you're seeing is my
mysterious dark side."</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>"Your... dark side..."</p>
<p>Harry sat up. Professor Quirrell was regarding him with one of
the strangest expressions Harry had seen on anyone's face, let
alone anyone as dignified as Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>"It happens when I get angry," Harry explained. "My blood runs
cold, everything gets cold, everything seems perfectly clear... In
retrospect it's been with me for a while - in my first year of
Muggle school, someone tried to take away my ball during recess and
I held it behind my back and kicked him in the solar plexus which
I'd read was a weak point, and the other kids didn't bother me
after that. And I bit a math teacher when she wouldn't accept my
dominance. But it's only just recently that I've been under enough
stress to notice that it's an actual, you know, mysterious dark
side, and not just an anger management problem like the school
psychologist said. And I don't have any super magical powers when
it happens, that was one of the first things I checked."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell rubbed his nose. "Let me think about this,"
he said.</p>
<p>Harry waited in silence for a full minute. He used that time to
stand up, which was more difficult than he had expected.</p>
<p>"Well," Professor Quirrell said after a while. "I suppose there
<em>was</em> something you could say that would convince me."</p>
<p>"I <em>have</em> already guessed that my dark side is really
just another part of me and that the answer isn't to never become
angry but to learn to stay in control by accepting it, I'm not dumb
or anything and I've seen this story enough times to know where
it's going, but it's hard and you seem like the person to help
me."</p>
<p>"Well... yes... very perspicacious of you, Mr. Potter, I must
say... that side of you is, as you seem to have already surmised,
your intent to kill, which as you say is a part of you..."</p>
<p>"And needs to be trained," Harry said, completing the
pattern.</p>
<p>"And needs to be trained, yes." That strange expression was
still on Professor Quirrell's face. "Mr. Potter, if you truly do
not wish to be the next Dark Lord, then what was the ambition which
the Sorting Hat tried to convince you to abandon, the ambition for
which you were Sorted into Slytherin?"</p>
<p>"I was Sorted into <em>Ravenclaw!</em> "</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter," said Professor Quirrell, now with a much more
usual-looking dry smile, "I know you are accustomed to everyone
around you being a fool, but please do not mistake me for one of
them. The likelihood that the Sorting Hat would play its first
prank in eight hundred years while it was upon your head is so
small as to not be worth considering. I suppose it is barely
possible that you snapped your fingers and invented some simple and
clever way to defeat the anti-tampering spells upon the Hat, though
I myself can think of no such method. But by far the most probable
explanation is that Dumbledore decided he was not happy with the
Hat's choice for the Boy-Who-Lived. This is evident to anyone with
the tiniest smidgin of common sense, so your secret is safe at
Hogwarts."</p>
<p>Harry opened his mouth, then closed it again with a feeling of
complete helplessness. Professor Quirrell was wrong, but wrong in
such a convincing way that Harry was starting to think that it
simply <em>was</em> the rational judgment given the evidence
available to Professor Quirrell. There were times, never
<em>predictable</em> times but still sometimes, when you would get
improbable evidence and the best knowable guess would be wrong. If
you had a medical test that was only wrong one time in a thousand,
sometimes it would still be wrong anyway.</p>
<p>"Can I ask you never to repeat what I'm about to say?" said
Harry.</p>
<p>"Absolutely," said Professor Quirrell. "Consider me asked."</p>
<p>Harry wasn't a fool either. "Can I consider you to have said
yes?"</p>
<p>"Very good, Mr. Potter. You may indeed so consider."</p>
<p>"<em>Professor Quirrell -</em>"</p>
<p>"I won't repeat what you're about to say," Professor Quirrell
said, smiling.</p>
<p>They both laughed, then Harry turned serious again. "The Sorting
Hat did seem to think I was going to end up as a Dark Lord unless I
went to Hufflepuff," Harry said. "But I don't <em>want</em> to be
one."</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter..." said Professor Quirrell. "Don't take this the
wrong way. I promise you will not be graded on the answer. I only
want to know your own, honest reply. Why not?"</p>
<p>Harry had that <em>helpless</em> feeling again. <em>Thou shalt
not become a Dark Lord</em> was such an obvious theorem in his
moral system that it was hard to describe the actual proof steps.
"Um, people would get hurt?"</p>
<p>"Surely you've wanted to hurt people," said Professor Quirrell.
"You wanted to hurt those bullies today. Being a Dark Lord means
that people you <em>want</em> to hurt get hurt."</p>
<p>Harry floundered for words and then decided to simply go with
the obvious. "First of all, just because I want to hurt someone
doesn't mean it's right -"</p>
<p>"What makes something right, if not your wanting it?"</p>
<p>"Ah," Harry said, "preference utilitarianism."</p>
<p>"Pardon me?" said Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>"It's the ethical theory that the good is what satisfies the
preferences of the most people -"</p>
<p>"No," Professor Quirrell said. His fingers rubbed the bridge of
his nose. "I don't think that's quite what I was trying to say. Mr.
Potter, in the end people all do what they want to do. Sometimes
people give names like 'right' to things they want to do, but how
could we possibly act on anything <em>but</em> our own
desires?"</p>
<p>"Well, obviously," Harry said. "I couldn't <em>act</em> on moral
considerations if they lacked the power to move me. But that
doesn't mean my wanting to hurt those Slytherins has the power to
move me <em>more</em> than moral considerations!"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell blinked.</p>
<p>"Not to mention," Harry said, "being a Dark Lord would mean that
a lot of innocent bystanders got hurt too!"</p>
<p>"Why does that matter to you?" Professor Quirrell said. "What
have they done for you?"</p>
<p>Harry laughed. "Oh, now <em>that</em> was around as subtle as
<em>Atlas Shrugged.</em>"</p>
<p>"Pardon me?" Professor Quirrell said again.</p>
<p>"It's a book that my parents wouldn't let me read because they
thought it would corrupt me, so of course I read it anyway and I
was offended they thought I would fall for any traps that obvious.
Blah blah blah, appeal to my sense of superiority, other people are
trying to keep me down, blah blah blah."</p>
<p>"So you're saying I need to make my traps less obvious?" said
Professor Quirrell. He tapped a finger on his cheek, looking
thoughtful. "I can work on that."</p>
<p>They both laughed.</p>
<p>"But to stay with the current question," said Professor
Quirrell, "what <em>have</em> all these other people done for
you?"</p>
<p>"Other people have done <em>huge</em> amounts for me!" Harry
said. "My parents took me in when my parents died because they were
<em>good people,</em> and to become a Dark Lord is to betray
that!"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was silent for a time.</p>
<p>"I confess," said Professor Quirrell quietly, "when I was your
age, that thought could not ever have come to me."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," Harry said.</p>
<p>"Don't be," said Professor Quirrell. "It was long ago, and I
resolved my parental issues to my own satisfaction. So you are held
back by the thought of your parents' disapproval? Does that mean
that if they died in an accident, there would be nothing left to
stop you from -"</p>
<p>"No," Harry said. "Just no. It is their <em>impulse to
kindness</em> which sheltered me. That impulse is not only in my
parents. And that impulse is what would be betrayed."</p>
<p>"In any case, Mr. Potter, you have not answered my original
question," said Professor Quirrell finally. "What <em>is</em> your
ambition?"</p>
<p>"Oh," said Harry. "Um.." He organized his thoughts. "To
understand everything important there is to know about the
universe, apply that knowledge to become omnipotent, and use that
power to rewrite reality because I have some objections to the way
it works now."</p>
<p>There was a slight pause.</p>
<p>"Forgive me if this is a stupid question, Mr. Potter," said
Professor Quirrell, "but are you <em>sure</em> you did not just
confess to wanting to be a Dark Lord?"</p>
<p>"That's only if you use your power for evil," explained Harry.
"If you use the power for good, you're a Light Lord."</p>
<p>"I see," Professor Quirrell said. He tapped his other cheek with
a finger. "I suppose I can work with that. But Mr. Potter, while
the scope of your ambition is worthy of Salazar himself, how
exactly do you propose to go about it? Is step one to become a
great fighting wizard, or Head Unspeakable, or Minister of Magic,
or -"</p>
<p>"Step one is to become a scientist."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was looking at Harry as if he'd just turned
into a cat.</p>
<p>"A scientist," Professor Quirrell said after a while.</p>
<p>Harry nodded.</p>
<p>"A <em>scientist?</em> " repeated Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said. "I shall achieve my objectives through the
power... of <em>Science!</em> "</p>
<p>"A <em>scientist!</em> " said Professor Quirrell. There was
genuine indignation on his face, and his voice had grown stronger
and sharper. "You could be the best of all my students! The
greatest fighting wizard to come out of Hogwarts in five decades! I
cannot picture you wasting your days in a white lab coat doing
pointless things to rats!"</p>
<p>"Hey!" said Harry. "There's more to science than that! Not that
there's anything <em>wrong</em> with experimenting on rats, of
course. But science <em>is</em> how you go about understanding and
controlling the universe -"</p>
<p>"Fool," said Professor Quirrell, in a voice of quiet, bitter
intensity. "You're a fool, Harry Potter." He passed a hand over his
face, and when that hand had passed, his face was calmer. "Or more
likely you have not yet found your true ambition. May I strongly
recommend that you try to become a Dark Lord instead? I will do
anything I can to help as a matter of public service."</p>
<p>"You don't like science," Harry said slowly. "Why not?"</p>
<p>"Those fool Muggles will kill us all someday!" Professor
Quirrell's voice had grown louder. "They will end it! End all of
it!"</p>
<p>Harry was feeling a bit lost here. "What are we talking about
here, nuclear weapons?"</p>
<p>"<em>Yes</em>, nuclear weapons!" Professor Quirrell was almost
shouting now. "Even He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named never used those,
perhaps because he didn't want to rule over a heap of ash! They
never should have been made! And it will only get worse with time!"
Professor Quirrell was standing up straight instead of leaning on
his desk. "There are gates you do not open, there are seals you do
not breach! The fools who can't resist meddling are killed by the
lesser perils early on, and the survivors all know that there are
secrets you <em>do not share</em> with anyone who lacks the
intelligence and the discipline to discover them for themselves!
Every powerful wizard knows that! Even the most terrible Dark
Wizards know that! And those idiot Muggles can't seem to figure it
out! The eager little fools who discovered the secret of nuclear
weapons didn't keep it to themselves, they told their <em>fool</em>
politicians and now <em>we</em> must live under the constant threat
of annihilation!"</p>
<p>This was a rather different way of looking at things than Harry
had grown up with. It had never occurred to him that nuclear
physicists should have formed a conspiracy of silence to keep the
secret of nuclear weapons from anyone not smart enough to be a
nuclear physicist. The thought was intriguing, if nothing else.
Would they have had secret passwords? Would they have had
masks?</p>
<p>(Actually, for all Harry knew, there <em>were</em> all sorts of
incredibly destructive secrets which physicists kept to themselves,
and the secret of nuclear weapons was the only one that had escaped
into the wild. The world would look the same to him either
way.)</p>
<p>"I'll have to think about that," Harry said to Professor
Quirrell. "It's a new idea to me. And one of the <em>hidden</em>
secrets of science, passed down from a few rare teachers to their
grad students, is how to avoid flushing new ideas down the toilet
the instant you hear one you don't like."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell blinked again.</p>
<p>"Is there any sort of science you <em>do</em> approve of?" said
Harry. "Medicine, maybe?"</p>
<p>"Space travel," said Professor Quirrell. "But the Muggles seem
to be dragging their feet on the one project which might have let
wizardkind escape this planet before they blow it up."</p>
<p>Harry nodded. "I'm a big fan of the space program too. At least
we have that much in common."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell looked at Harry. Something flickered in the
professor's eyes. "I will have your word, your promise and your
oath never to speak of what follows."</p>
<p>"You have it," Harry said immediately.</p>
<p>"See to it that you keep your oath or you will not like the
results," said Professor Quirrell. "I will now cast a rare and
powerful spell, not on you, but on the classroom around us. Stand
still, so that you do not touch the boundaries of the spell once it
has been cast. You must not interact with the magic which I am
maintaining. Look only. Otherwise I will end the spell." Professor
Quirrell paused. "And try not to fall over."</p>
<p>Harry nodded, puzzled and anticipatory.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell raised his wand and said something that
Harry's ears and mind couldn't grasp at all, words that bypassed
awareness and vanished into oblivion.</p>
<p>The marble in a short radius around Harry's feet stayed
constant. All the other marble of the floor vanished, the walls and
ceilings vanished.</p>
<p>Harry stood on a small circle of white marble in the midst of an
endless field of stars, burning terribly bright and unwavering.
There was no Earth, no Moon, no Sun that Harry recognized.
Professor Quirrell stood in the same place as before, floating in
the midst of the starfield. The Milky Way was already visible as a
great wash of light and it grew brighter as Harry's vision adjusted
to the darkness.</p>
<p>The sight wrenched at Harry's heart like nothing he had ever
seen.</p>
<p>"Are we... in space...?"</p>
<p>"No," said Professor Quirrell. His voice was sad, and reverent.
"But it is a true image."</p>
<p>Tears came into Harry's eyes. He wiped them away frantically, he
would not miss this for some stupid water blurring his vision.</p>
<p>The stars were no longer tiny jewels set in a giant velvet dome,
as they were in the night sky of Earth. Here there was no sky
above, no surrounding sphere. Only points of perfect light against
perfect blackness, an infinite and empty void with countless tiny
holes through which shone the brilliance from some unimaginable
realm beyond.</p>
<p>In space, the stars <em>looked</em> terribly, terribly, terribly
far away.</p>
<p>Harry kept on wiping his eyes, over and over.</p>
<p>"Sometimes," Professor Quirrell said in a voice so quiet it
almost wasn't there, "when this flawed world seems unusually
hateful, I wonder whether there might be some other place, far
away, where I should have been. I cannot seem to imagine what that
place might be, and if I can't even imagine it then how can I
believe it exists? And yet the universe is so very, very wide, and
perhaps it might exist anyway? But the stars are so very, very far
away. It would take a long, long time to get there, even if I knew
the way. And I wonder what I would dream about, if I slept for a
long, long time..."</p>
<p>Though it felt like sacrilege, Harry managed a whisper. "Please
let me stay here awhile."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell nodded, where he stood unsupported against
the stars.</p>
<p>It was easy to forget the small circle of marble on which you
stood, and your own body, and become a point of awareness which
might have been still, or might have been moving. With all
distances incalculable there was no way to tell.</p>
<p>There was a time of no time.</p>
<p>And then the stars vanished, and the classroom returned.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," said Professor Quirrell, "but we're about to have
company."</p>
<p>"It's fine," Harry whispered. "It was enough." He would never
forget this day, and not because of the unimportant things that had
happened earlier. He would learn how to cast that spell if it was
the last thing he ever learned.</p>
<p>Then the heavy oaken doors of the classroom blasted off their
hinges and skittered across the marble floor with a high-pitched
shriek.</p>
<p>"<em>QUIRINUS! HOW DARE YOU!</em> "</p>
<p>Like a vast thundercloud, an ancient and powerful wizard blew
into the room, a look of such incandescent rage upon his face that
the stern look he had earlier turned upon Harry seemed like
nothing.</p>
<p>There was a wrench of disorientation in Harry's mind as the part
that wanted to run away screaming from the scariest thing it had
ever seen ran away, rotating into place a part of him which could
take the shock.</p>
<p><em>None</em> of Harry's facets were happy about having their
star-gazing interrupted. "Headmaster Albus Percival -" Harry
started to say in icy tones.</p>
<p><em>WHAM.</em> Professor Quirrell's hand came down hard upon his
desk. "<em>Mr. Potter!</em> " barked Professor Quirrell. "This is
the <em>Headmaster of Hogwarts</em> and you are a mere student! You
will address him appropriately!"</p>
<p>Harry looked at Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was giving Harry a stern glare.</p>
<p>Neither of them smiled.</p>
<p>Dumbledore's long strides had come to a halt before where Harry
stood in front of the dais and Professor Quirrell stood by his
desk. The Headmaster stared in shock at both of them.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," Harry said in meekly polite tones. "Headmaster,
thank you for wanting to protect me, but Professor Quirrell did the
right thing."</p>
<p>Slowly, Dumbledore's expression changed from something that
would vaporize steel into something merely angry. "I heard students
saying that this man had you abused by older Slytherins! That he
forbade you to defend yourself!"</p>
<p>Harry nodded. "He knew exactly what was wrong with me and he
showed me how to fix it."</p>
<p>"Harry, <em>what are you talking about?</em> "</p>
<p>"I was teaching him how to lose," Professor Quirrell said dryly.
"It's an important life skill."</p>
<p>It was apparent that Dumbledore still didn't understand, but his
voice had lowered in register. "Harry..." he said slowly. "If
there's any threat the Defense Professor has offered you to prevent
you from complaining -"</p>
<p><em>You lunatic, after today of all days do you really think I
-</em></p>
<p>"Headmaster," Harry said, trying to look abashed, "what's wrong
with me isn't that I keep quiet about abusive professors."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell chuckled. "Not perfect, Mr. Potter, but good
enough for your first day. Headmaster, did you stay long enough to
hear about the fifty-one points for Ravenclaw, or did you storm out
as soon as you heard the first part?"</p>
<p>A brief look of disconcertment crossed Dumbledore's face,
followed by surprise. "Fifty-one points for Ravenclaw?"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell nodded. "He wasn't expecting them, but it
seemed appropriate. Tell Professor McGonagall that I think the
story of what Mr. Potter went through to earn back the lost points
will do just as well to make her point. No, Headmaster, Mr. Potter
didn't tell me anything. It's easy to see which part of today's
events are her work, just as I know that the final compromise was
your own suggestion. Though I wonder how on Earth Mr. Potter was
able to gain the upper hand over both Snape and you and then
Professor McGonagall was able to gain the upper hand over him."</p>
<p>Somehow Harry managed to control his face. Was it <em>that</em>
obvious to a real Slytherin?</p>
<p>Dumbledore came closer to Harry, scrutinizing. "Your color looks
a little off, Harry," the old wizard said. He peered closely at
Harry's face. "What did you have for lunch today?"</p>
<p>"What?" Harry said, his mind wobbling in sudden confusion. Why
would Dumbledore be asking about deep-fried lamb and thin-sliced
broccoli when that was just about the <em>last</em> probable cause
of -</p>
<p>The old wizard straightened up. "Never mind, then. I think
you're fine."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell coughed, loudly and deliberately. Harry
looked at the professor, and saw that Professor Quirrell was
staring sharply at Dumbledore.</p>
<p>"<em>Ah-hem!</em> " Professor Quirrell said again.</p>
<p>Dumbledore and Professor Quirrell locked eyes, and something
seemed to pass between them.</p>
<p>"If you don't tell him," Professor Quirrell said then, "I will,
even if you fire me for it."</p>
<p>Dumbledore sighed and turned back to Harry. "I apologize for
invading your mental privacy, Mr. Potter," the Headmaster said
formally. "I had no purpose except to determine if Professor
Quirrell had done the same."</p>
<p><em>What?</em></p>
<p>The confusion lasted just exactly as long as it took Harry to
understand what had just happened.</p>
<p>"<em>You - !</em> "</p>
<p>"Gently, Mr. Potter," said Professor Quirrell. His face was
hard, however, as he stared at Dumbledore.</p>
<p>"Legilimency is sometimes mistaken for common sense," said the
Headmaster. "But it leaves traces which another skillful Legilimens
can detect. That was all I looked for, Mr. Potter, and I asked you
an irrelevant question to ensure you wouldn't think about anything
important while I looked."</p>
<p>"<em>You should have asked first!</em> "</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell shook his head. "No, Mr. Potter, the
Headmaster had some justification for his concerns, and had he
asked for permission you would have thought of exactly those things
you did not wish him to see." Professor Quirrell's voice grew
sharper. "I am rather more concerned, Headmaster, that you saw no
need to tell him afterward!"</p>
<p>"You have now made it more difficult to confirm his mental
privacy on future occasions," Dumbledore said. He favored Professor
Quirrell with a cold look. "Was that your intention, I wonder?"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's expression was implacable. "There are too
many Legilimens in this school. I insist that Mr. Potter receive
instruction in Occlumency. Will you permit me to be his tutor?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely not," Dumbledore said at once.</p>
<p>"I did not think so. Then since <em>you</em> have deprived him
of my free services, <em>you</em> will pay for Mr. Potter's
tutoring by a licensed Occlumency instructor."</p>
<p>"Such services do not come cheaply," Dumbledore said, looking at
Professor Quirrell in some surprise. "Although I do have certain
connections -"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell shook his head firmly. "No. Mr. Potter will
ask his account manager at Gringotts to recommend a neutral
instructor. With respect, Headmaster Dumbledore, after the events
of this morning I must protest you or your friends having access to
Mr. Potter's mind. I must also insist that the instructor have
taken an Unbreakable Vow to reveal nothing, and that he agree to be
Obliviated of each session immediately afterward."</p>
<p>Dumbledore was frowning. "Such services are <em>extremely</em>
expensive, as you well know, and I cannot help but wonder why
<em>you</em> deem them necessary."</p>
<p>"If it's money that's the problem," Harry spoke up, "I have some
ideas for making large amounts of money quickly -"</p>
<p>"Thank you Quirinus, your wisdom is now quite evident and I am
sorry for disputing it. Your concern for Harry Potter does you
credit, as well."</p>
<p>"You're welcome," said Professor Quirrell. "I hope you will not
object if I go on making him a particular focus of my attentions."
Professor Quirrell's face was now very serious, and very still.</p>
<p>Dumbledore looked at Harry.</p>
<p>"It is my own wish also," Harry said.</p>
<p>"So that's how it is to be..." the old wizard said slowly.
Something strange passed across his face. "Harry... you must
realize that if you choose this man as your teacher and your
friend, your first mentor, then one way or another you will lose
him, and the manner in which you lose him may or may not allow you
to ever get him back."</p>
<p>That hadn't occurred to Harry. But there <em>was</em> that jinx
on the Defense position... one which had apparently worked with
perfect regularity for decades...</p>
<p>"Probably," said Professor Quirrell quietly, "but he will have
the full use of me while I last."</p>
<p>Dumbledore sighed. "I suppose it is economical, at least, since
as the Defense Professor you're <em>already</em> doomed in some
unknown fashion."</p>
<p>Harry had to work hard to suppress his expression as he realized
what Dumbledore had actually been implying.</p>
<p>"I will inform Madam Pince that Mr. Potter is allowed to obtain
books on Occlumency," said Dumbledore.</p>
<p>"There is preliminary training which you must do on your own,"
said Professor Quirrell to Harry. "And I do suggest that you hurry
up on it."</p>
<p>Harry nodded.</p>
<p>"I'll take my leave of you then," said Dumbledore. He nodded to
both Harry and Professor Quirrell, and departed, walking a bit
slowly.</p>
<p>"Can you cast the spell again?" Harry said the moment Dumbledore
was gone.</p>
<p>"Not today," said Professor Quirrell quietly, "and not tomorrow
either, I'm afraid. It takes a lot out of me to cast, though less
to keep going, and so I usually prefer to maintain it as long as
possible. This time I cast it on impulse. Had I thought, and
realized we might be interrupted -"</p>
<p>Dumbledore was now Harry's least favorite person in the entire
world.</p>
<p>They both sighed.</p>
<p>"Even if I only ever see it once," Harry said, "I will never
stop being grateful to you."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell nodded.</p>
<p>"Have you heard of the Pioneer program?" Harry said. "They were
probes that would fly by different planets and take pictures. Two
of the probes would end up on trajectories that took them out of
the Solar System and into interstellar space. So they put a golden
plaque on the probes, with a picture of a man, and a woman, and
showing where to find our Sun in the galaxy."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was silent for a moment, then smiled. "Tell
me, Mr. Potter, can you guess what thought went through my mind
when I finished assembling the thirty-seven items on the list of
things I would never do as a Dark Lord? Put yourself in my shoes -
imagine yourself in my place - and guess."</p>
<p>Harry imagined himself looking over a list of thirty-seven
things not to do once he became a Dark Lord.</p>
<p>"You decided that if you had to follow the <em>whole</em> list
<em>all</em> the time, there wouldn't be much point in becoming a
Dark Lord in the first place," Harry said.</p>
<p>"<em>Precisely</em>," said Professor Quirrell. He was grinning.
"So I am going to violate rule two - which was simply 'don't brag'
- and tell you about something I have done. I don't see how the
knowledge could do any harm. And I strongly suspect you would have
figured it out anyway, once we knew each other well enough.
Nonetheless... I shall have your oath never to speak of what I am
about to tell."</p>
<p>"You have it!" Harry had a feeling this was going to be
<em>really</em> good.</p>
<p>"I subscribe to a Muggle bulletin which keeps me informed of
progress on space travel. I didn't hear about Pioneer 10 until they
reported its launch. But when I discovered that Pioneer 11 would
also be leaving the Solar System forever," Professor Quirrell said,
his grin the widest that Harry had yet seen from him, "I snuck into
NASA, I did, and I cast a lovely little spell on that lovely golden
plaque which will make it last a lot longer than it otherwise
would."</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>"Yes," Professor Quirrell said, who now seemed to be standing
around fifty feet taller, "I thought that was how you might
react."</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>"...I can't think of anything to say."</p>
<p>"'You win' seems appropriate," said Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>"You win," Harry said immediately.</p>
<p>"See?" said Professor Quirrell. "We can only imagine what giant
heap of trouble you would have gotten into if you had been unable
to say that."</p>
<p>They both laughed.</p>
<p>A further thought occurred to Harry. "You didn't add any extra
information to the plaque, did you?"</p>
<p>"Extra information?" said Professor Quirrell, sounding as if the
idea had never occurred to him before and he was quite
intrigued.</p>
<p>Which made Harry rather suspicious, considering that it'd taken
less than a minute for <em>Harry</em> to think of it.</p>
<p>"Maybe you included a holographic message like in <em>Star
Wars?</em> " said Harry. "Or... hm. A portrait seems to store a
whole human brain's worth of information... you couldn't have added
any extra mass to the probe, but maybe you could've turned an
existing part into a portrait of yourself? Or you found a volunteer
dying of a terminal illness, snuck them into NASA, and cast a spell
to make sure their <em>ghost</em> ended up in the plaque -"</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter," Professor Quirrell said, his voice suddenly sharp,
"a spell requiring a human death would certainly be classified by
the Ministry as Dark Arts, regardless of circumstances. Students
should not be heard talking about such things."</p>
<p>And the amazing thing about the way Professor Quirrell said it
was how perfectly it maintained plausible deniability. It had been
said in exactly the appropriate tone for someone who wasn't willing
to discuss such things and thought students should steer away from
them. Harry honestly <em>didn't know</em> whether Professor
Quirrell was just waiting to talk about it until after Harry had
learned to protect his mind.</p>
<p>"Got it," Harry said. "I won't talk with anyone else about that
idea."</p>
<p>"Please be discreet about the whole matter, Mr. Potter,"
Professor Quirrell said. "I prefer to go through my life without
attracting public notice. You will find nothing in the newspapers
about Quirinus Quirrell until I decided it was time for me to teach
Defense at Hogwarts."</p>
<p>That seemed a little sad, but Harry understood. Then Harry
realized the implications. "So just how much awesome stuff
<em>have</em> you done that no one else knows about -"</p>
<p>"Oh, some," said Professor Quirrell. "But I think that's quite
enough for today, Mr. Potter, I confess I am feeling a bit tired
-"</p>
<p>"I understand. And <em>thank you.</em> For
<em>everything</em>."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell nodded, but he was leaning harder on his
desk.</p>
<p>Harry quickly took his leave.</p>

Rowling, but to choose so that <em>all</em> paths lead to a J. K.
Rowling.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>A small study room, near but not in the Ravenclaw dorm, one of
the many many unused rooms of Hogwarts. Gray stone the floors, red
brick the walls, dark stained wood the ceiling, four glowing glass
globes set into the four walls of the room. A circular table that
looked like a wide slab of black marble set on thick black marble
legs for columns, but which had proved to be very light (weight and
mass both) and wasn't difficult to pick up and move around if
necessary. Two comfortably cushioned chairs which had seemed at
first to be locked to the floor in inconvenient places, but which
would, the two of them had finally discovered, scoot around to
where you stood as soon as you leaned over in a posture that looked
like you were about to sit down.</p>
<p>There also seemed to be a number of bats flying around the
room.</p>
<p>That was where, future historians would one day record -
<em>if</em> the whole project ever actually amounted to anything -
the scientific study of magic had begun, with two young first-year
Hogwarts students.</p>
<p>Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, theorist.</p>
<p>And Hermione Jean Granger, experimenter and test subject.</p>
<p>Harry was doing better in classes now, at least the classes he
considered interesting. He'd read more books, and not books for
eleven-year-olds either. He'd practiced Transfiguration over and
over during one of his extra hours every day, taking the other hour
for beginning Occlumency. He was taking the worthwhile classes
<em>seriously,</em> not just turning in his homework every day, but
using his free time to learn more than was required, to read other
books beyond the given textbooks, looking to master the subject and
not just memorize a few test answers, to excel. You didn't see that
much outside Ravenclaw. And now even <em>within</em> Ravenclaw, his
only remaining competitors were Padma Patil (whose parents came
from a non-English-speaking culture and thus had raised her with an
actual work ethic), Anthony Goldstein (out of a certain tiny ethnic
group that won 25% of the Nobel Prizes), and of course, striding
far above everyone like a Titan strolling through a pack of
puppies, Hermione Granger.</p>
<p>To run this particular experiment you needed the test subject to
learn sixteen new spells, on their own, without help or correction.
That meant the test subject was Hermione. Period.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned at this point that the bats flying around
the room were <em>not</em> glowing.</p>
<p>Harry was having trouble accepting the implications of this.</p>
<p>"<em>Oogely boogely!</em> " Hermione said again.</p>
<p>Again, at the tip of Hermione's wand, there was the abrupt,
transitionless appearance of a bat. One moment, empty air. The next
moment, bat. Its wings seemed to be already moving in the instant
when it appeared.</p>
<p>And it <em>still wasn't glowing.</em></p>
<p>"Can I stop now?" said Hermione.</p>
<p>"Are you sure," Harry said through what seemed to be a block in
his throat, "that maybe with a bit more practice you couldn't get
it to glow?" He was violating the experimental procedure he'd
written down beforehand, which was a sin, and he was violating it
because he didn't like the results he was getting, which was a
<em>mortal</em> sin, you could go to Science Hell for that, but it
didn't seem to be mattering anyway.</p>
<p>"What did you change this time?" Hermione said, sounding a
little weary.</p>
<p>"The durations of the <em>oo,</em> <em>eh,</em> and <em>ee</em>
sounds. It's supposed to be 3 to 2 to 2, not 3 to 1 to 1."</p>
<p>"<em>Oogely boogely!</em> " said Hermione.</p>
<p>The bat materialized with only one wing and spun pathetically to
the floor, flopping around in a circle on the gray stone.</p>
<p>"Now what is it really?" said Hermione.</p>
<p>"3 to 2 to 1."</p>
<p>"<em>Oogely boogely!</em> "</p>
<p>This time the bat didn't have any wings at all and fell with a
plop like a dead mouse.</p>
<p>"3 to 1 to 2."</p>
<p>And lo the bat did materialize and it did fly up at once toward
the ceiling, healthy and glowing a bright green.</p>
<p>Hermione nodded in satisfaction. "Okay, what next?"</p>
<p>There was a long pause.</p>
<p>"<em>Seriously?</em> You <em>seriously</em> have to say
<em>Oogely boogely</em> with the duration of the <em>oo,</em>
<em>eh,</em> and <em>ee</em> sounds having a ratio of 3 to 1 to 2,
or the bat won't glow? <em>Why? Why? For the love of all that is
sacred, why?</em> "</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"<em>AAAAAAAAARRRRRRGHHHH!</em> "</p>
<p><em>Thud. Thud. Thud.</em></p>
<p>Harry had thought about the nature of magic for a while, and
then designed a series of experiments based on the premise that
virtually everything wizards believed about magic was wrong.</p>
<p>You couldn't <em>really</em> need to say 'Wingardium Leviosa' in
exactly the right way in order to levitate something, because, come
on, 'Wingardium Leviosa'? The universe was going to check that you
said 'Wingardium Leviosa' in exactly the right way and otherwise it
wouldn't make the quill float?</p>
<p>No. Obviously no, once you thought about it seriously. Someone,
quite possibly an actual preschool child, but at any rate some
English-speaking magic user, who thought that 'Wingardium Leviosa'
sounded all flyish and floaty, had originally spoken those words
while casting the spell for the first time. And then told everyone
else it was necessary.</p>
<p>But (Harry had reasoned) it didn't <em>have</em> to be that way,
it wasn't built into the universe, it was built into
<em>you</em>.</p>
<p>There was an old story passed down among scientists, a
cautionary tale, the story of Blondlot and the N-Rays.</p>
<p>Shortly after the discovery of X-Rays, an eminent French
physicist named Prosper-Rene Blondlot - who had been first to
measure the speed of radio waves and show that they propagated at
the speed of light - had announced the discovery of an amazing new
phenomenon, N-Rays, which would induce a faint brightening of a
screen. You had to look hard to see it, but it was there. N-Rays
had all sorts of interesting properties. They were bent by
aluminium and could be focused by an aluminium prism into striking
a treated thread of cadmium sulfide, which would then glow faintly
in the dark...</p>
<p>Soon dozens of other scientists had confirmed Blondlot's
results, especially in France.</p>
<p>But there were still other scientists, in England and Germany,
who said they weren't quite sure they could see that faint
glow.</p>
<p>Blondlot had said they were probably setting up the machinery
wrong.</p>
<p>One day Blondlot had given a demonstration of N-Rays. The lights
had turned out, and his assistant had called off the brightening
and darkening as Blondlot performed his manipulations.</p>
<p>It had been a normal demonstration, all the results going as
expected.</p>
<p>Even though an American scientist named Robert Wood had quietly
stolen the aluminium prism from the center of Blondlot's
mechanism.</p>
<p>And that had been the end of N-Rays.</p>
<p><em>Reality,</em> Philip K. Dick had once said, <em>is that
which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away.</em></p>
<p>Blondlot's sin had been obvious in retrospect. He shouldn't have
told his assistant what he was doing. Blondlot should have made
sure the assistant <em>didn't</em> know what was being tried or
when it was being tried, before asking him to describe the screen's
brightness. It could have been that simple.</p>
<p>Nowadays it was called "blinding" and it was one of the things
modern scientists took for granted. If you were doing a psychology
experiment to see whether people got angrier when they were hit
over the head with red truncheons than with green truncheons, you
didn't get to look at the subjects yourself and decide how "angry"
they were. You would snap photos of them after they'd been hit with
the truncheon, and send the photos off to a panel of raters, who
would rate on a scale of 1 to 10 how angry each person looked,
obviously <em>without</em> knowing what color of truncheon they'd
been hit with. Indeed there was no good reason to tell the raters
what the experiment was about, at all. You <em>certainly</em>
wouldn't tell the experimental subjects that <em>you thought</em>
they ought to be angrier when hit by red truncheons. You'd just
offer them 20 pounds, lure them into a test room, hit them with a
truncheon, color randomly assigned of course, and snap the photo.
In fact the truncheon-hitting and photo-snapping would be done by
an assistant who hadn't been told about the hypothesis, so he
couldn't look expectant, hit harder, or snap the photo at just the
right time.</p>
<p>Blondlot had destroyed his reputation with the sort of mistake
that would get a failing grade and probably derisive laughter from
the T.A. in a first-year undergraduate course on experimental
design... in 1991.</p>
<p>But this had been a bit longer ago, in 1904, and so it had taken
months before Robert Wood had formulated the obvious alternative
hypothesis and figured out how to test it, and dozens of other
scientists had been sucked in.</p>
<p>More than two centuries after science had gotten started. That
late in scientific history, it still hadn't been obvious.</p>
<p>Which made it <em>entirely</em> plausible that in the tiny
wizarding world, where science didn't seem much known at all, no
one had ever tried the first, the simplest, the most obvious thing
that any modern scientist would think to check.</p>
<p>The books were full of complicated instructions for all the
things you had to do <em>exactly right</em> in order to cast a
spell. And, Harry had hypothesized, the process of obeying those
instructions, of checking that you were following them correctly,
probably <em>did</em> do something. It <em>forced you to
concentrate on the spell</em>. Being told to just wave your wand
and wish probably <em>wouldn't</em> work as well. And once you
believed the spell was supposed to work a certain way, once you had
practiced it that way, you might not be able to convince yourself
that it could work any <em>other</em> way...</p>
<p>...if you did the simple but wrong thing, and tried to test
alternative forms <em>yourself.</em></p>
<p>But what if you <em>didn't know</em> what the original spell had
been like?</p>
<p>What if you gave Hermione a list of spells she hadn't studied
yet, taken from a book of silly prank spells in the Hogwarts
library, and some of those spells had the correct and original
instructions, while others had one changed gesture, one changed
word? What if you kept the instructions constant, but told her that
a spell supposed to create a red worm was supposed to create a blue
worm instead?</p>
<p>Well, in that case, it had turned out...</p>
<p>...Harry was having trouble believing his results here...</p>
<p>...if you told Hermione to say "Oogely boogely" with the vowel
durations in the ratio of 3 to 1 to 1, instead of the correct ratio
of 3 to 1 to 2, you still got the bat but it wouldn't glow any
more.</p>
<p>Not that belief was <em>irrelevant</em> here. Not that
<em>only</em> the words and wand movements mattered.</p>
<p>If you gave Hermione completely incorrect information about what
a spell was supposed to do, it would stop working.</p>
<p>If you didn't tell her at all what the spell was supposed to do,
it would stop working.</p>
<p>If she knew in very vague terms what the spell was supposed to
do, or she was only partially wrong, then the spell would work as
originally described in the book, not the way she'd been told it
should.</p>
<p>Harry was, at this moment, literally banging his head against
the brick wall. Not hard. He didn't want to damage his precious
brains. But if he didn't have some outlet for his frustration, he
would spontaneously catch on fire.</p>
<p><em>Thud. Thud. Thud.</em></p>
<p>It seemed the universe actually <em>did</em> want you to say
'Wingardium Leviosa' and it wanted you to say it in a certain exact
way and it didn't care what <em>you</em> thought the pronunciation
should be any more than it cared how you felt about gravity.</p>
<p><em>WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY?</em></p>
<p>The worst part of it was the smug, amused look on Hermione's
face.</p>
<p>Hermione had <em>not</em> been okay with sitting around
obediently following Harry's instructions without being told
why.</p>
<p>So Harry had explained to her what they were testing.</p>
<p>Harry had explained why they were testing it.</p>
<p>Harry had explained why probably no wizard had tried it before
them.</p>
<p>Harry had explained that he was actually fairly confident of his
prediction.</p>
<p>Because, Harry had said, there was <em>no way</em> that the
universe actually wanted you to say 'Wingardium Leviosa'.</p>
<p>Hermione had pointed out that this was not what her books said.
Hermione had asked if Harry really thought he was smarter, at
eleven years old and just over a month into his Hogwarts education,
than all the other wizards in the world who disagreed with him.</p>
<p>Harry had said the following exact words:</p>
<p>"Of course."</p>
<p>Now Harry was staring at the red brick directly in front of him
and contemplating how hard he would have to hit his head in order
to give himself a concussion that would interfere with long-term
memory formation and prevent him from remembering this later.
Hermione wasn't laughing, but he could feel her <em>intent to
laugh</em> radiating out from behind him like a dreadful pressure
on his skin, sort of like knowing you were being stalked by a
serial killer only <em>worse.</em></p>
<p>"Say it," Harry said.</p>
<p>"I wasn't <em>going</em> to," said the kindly voice of Hermione
Granger. "It didn't seem nice."</p>
<p>"Just get it over with," said Harry.</p>
<p>"Okay! So you gave me this <em>whole long lecture</em> about how
hard it was to do basic science and how we might need to stay on
the problem for <em>thirty-five years</em>, and then you went and
expected us to make the greatest discovery in the history of magic
in the first hour we were working together. You didn't just hope,
you really expected it. You're silly."</p>
<p>"Thank you. Now -"</p>
<p>"I've read all the books you gave me and I still don't know what
to call that. Overconfidence? Planning fallacy? Super duper Lake
Wobegon effect? They'll have to name it after you. Harry Bias."</p>
<p>"All <em>right!</em> "</p>
<p>"But it <em>is</em> cute. It's such a boy thing to do."</p>
<p>"<em>Drop dead.</em>"</p>
<p>"Aw, you say the most romantic things."</p>
<p><em>Thud. Thud. Thud.</em></p>
<p>"So what's next?" said Hermione.</p>
<p>Harry rested his head against the bricks. His forehead was
starting to hurt where he'd been banging it. "Nothing. I have to go
back and design different experiments."</p>
<p>Over the last month, Harry had carefully worked out, in advance,
a course of experimentation for them that would have lasted until
December.</p>
<p>It would have been a <em>great</em> set of experiments if the
<em>very first test</em> had not falsified the basic premise.</p>
<p>Harry could not believe he had been this dumb.</p>
<p>"Let me correct myself," said Harry. "I need to design
<em>one</em> new experiment. I'll let you know when we've got it,
and we'll do it, and then I'll design the next one. How does that
sound?"</p>
<p>"It sounds like <em>someone</em> wasted a <em>whole lot of
effort</em>."</p>
<p><em>Thud.</em> Ow. He'd done that a bit harder than he'd
planned.</p>
<p>"So," said Hermione. She was leaning back in her chair and the
smug look was back on her face. "What did we discover today?"</p>
<p>"I discovered," said Harry through gritted teeth, "that when it
comes to doing truly basic research on a genuinely confusing
problem where you have no clue what's going on, my books on
scientific methodology aren't worth crap -"</p>
<p>"Language, Mr. Potter! Some of us are innocent young girls!"</p>
<p>"Fine. But if my books were worth a <em>carp,</em> that's a kind
of fish not anything bad, they would have given me the following
important piece of advice: When there's a confusing problem and
you're just starting out and you have a falsifiable hypothesis, go
test it. Find some simple, easy way of doing a basic check and do
it right away. Don't worry about designing an elaborate course of
experiments that would make a grant proposal look impressive to a
funding agency. Just check as fast as possible whether your ideas
are false before you start investing huge amounts of effort in
them. How does that sound for a moral?"</p>
<p>"Mmm... okay," said Hermione. "But I was also hoping for
something like 'Hermione's books aren't worthless. They're written
by wise old wizards who know way more about magic than I do. I
should pay attention to what Hermione's books say.' Can we have
that moral too?"</p>
<p>Harry's jaw seemed to be clenched too tightly to let any words
out, so he just nodded.</p>
<p>"Great!" Hermione said. "I liked this experiment. We learned a
lot from it and it only took me an hour or so."</p>
<p>"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>In the dungeons of Slytherin.</p>
<p>An unused classroom lit with eerie green light, much brighter
this time and coming from a small crystal globe with a temporary
enchantment, but eerie green light nonetheless, casting strange
shadows from the dusty desks.</p>
<p>Two boy-sized figures in cowled grey cloaks (no masks) had
entered in silence, and sat down in two chairs opposite the same
desk.</p>
<p>It was the second meeting of the Bayesian Conspiracy.</p>
<p>Draco Malfoy hadn't been sure if he should look forward to it or
not.</p>
<p>Harry Potter, judging by the expression on his face, didn't seem
to have any doubts on the appropriate mood.</p>
<p>Harry Potter looked like he was ready to kill someone.</p>
<p>"Hermione Granger," said Harry Potter, just as Draco was opening
his mouth. "<em>Don't ask</em>."</p>
<p><em>He couldn't have gone on another date, could he?</em>
thought Draco, but that didn't make any sense.</p>
<p>"Harry," said Draco, "I'm sorry but I have to ask this anyway,
did you <em>really</em> order the mudblood girl an expensive
mokeskin pouch for her birthday?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I did. You've already worked out why, of course."</p>
<p>Draco reached up and raked fingers through his hair in
frustration, his cowl brushing the back of his hand. He
<em>hadn't</em> been quite sure why, but now he couldn't say so.
And Slytherin <em>knew</em> he was courting Harry Potter, he'd made
it obvious enough in Defense class. "Harry," said Draco, "people
know I'm friends with you, they don't know about the Conspiracy of
course, but they know we're friends, and it makes <em>me</em> look
bad when you do that sort of thing."</p>
<p>Harry Potter's face tightened. "Anyone in Slytherin who can't
understand the concept of acting nice toward people you don't
actually like should be ground up and fed to pet snakes."</p>
<p>"There are a lot of people in Slytherin who <em>don't,</em>"
Draco said, his voice serious. "Most people are stupid, and you
have to look good in front of them anyway." Harry Potter
<em>had</em> to understand that if he ever wanted to get anywhere
in life.</p>
<p>"What do <em>you</em> care what other people think? Are you
really going to live your life needing to explain everything you do
to the dumbest idiots in Slytherin, letting <em>them</em> judge
<em>you?</em> I'm sorry, Draco, but I'm not lowering my cunning
plots to the level of what the dumbest Slytherins can understand,
just because it might make you look bad otherwise. Not even your
friendship is worth that. It would <em>take all the fun out of
life.</em> Tell me <em>you</em> haven't ever thought the same thing
when someone in Slytherin is being too stupid to breathe, that it's
beneath the dignity of a Malfoy to have to pander to them."</p>
<p>Draco genuinely hadn't. Ever. Pandering to idiots was like
breathing, you did it without thinking about it.</p>
<p>"Harry," Draco said at last. "Just doing whatever you want,
without worrying about how it looks, isn't smart. The <em>Dark
Lord</em> worried about how he looked! He was feared and hated, and
he knew <em>exactly</em> what sort of fear and hate he wanted to
create. <em>Everyone</em> has to worry about what other people
think."</p>
<p>The cowled figure shrugged. "Perhaps. Remind me sometime to tell
you about something called Asch's Conformity Experiment, you might
find it quite amusing. For now I'll just note that it's dangerous
to worry about what other people think on <em>instinct,</em>
because you <em>actually care,</em> not as a matter of cold-blooded
calculation. Remember, I was beaten and bullied by older Slytherins
for fifteen minutes, and afterward I stood up and graciously
forgave them. Just like the good and virtuous Boy-Who-Lived ought
to do. But my cold-blooded calculations, Draco, tell me that I have
<em>no use</em> for the dumbest idiots in Slytherin, since <em>I
don't own a pet snake.</em> So I have no reason to care what they
think about how I conduct my duel with Hermione Granger."</p>
<p>Draco did not clench his fists in frustration. "She's just some
mudblood," Draco said, keeping his voice calm, rather than
shouting. "If you don't like her, push her down the stairs."</p>
<p>"Ravenclaw would know -"</p>
<p>"Have Pansy Parkinson push her down the stairs! You wouldn't
even have to manipulate her, offer her a Sickle and she'd do
it!"</p>
<p>"<em>I</em> would know! Hermione beat me in a book-reading
contest, she's getting better grades than me, I have to defeat her
with my <em>brain</em> or it doesn't count!"</p>
<p>"<em>She's just a mudblood! Why do you respect her that
much?</em> "</p>
<p>"<em>She's a power among Ravenclaws! Why do you care what some
powerless idiot in Slytherin thinks?</em> "</p>
<p>"<em>It's called politics! And if you can't play it you can't
have power!</em> "</p>
<p>"<em>Walking on the moon is power! Being a great wizard is
power! There are kinds of power that don't require me to spend the
rest of my life pandering to morons!</em> "</p>
<p>Both of them stopped, and, in almost perfect unison, began
taking deep breaths to calm themselves.</p>
<p>"Sorry," Harry Potter said after a few moments, wiping sweat
from his forehead. "Sorry, Draco. You've got a lot of political
power and it makes sense for you to keep it. You <em>should</em> be
calculating what Slytherin thinks. It's an important game and I
shouldn't have insulted it. But you can't ask <em>me</em> to lower
the level of my game in Ravenclaw, just so that you don't look bad
by associating with me. Tell Slytherin you're gritting your teeth
while you pretend to be my friend."</p>
<p>That was exactly what Draco <em>had</em> told Slytherin, and he
still wasn't sure whether it was true.</p>
<p>"Anyway," Draco said. "Speaking of your image. I'm afraid I've
got some bad news. Rita Skeeter heard some of the stories about you
and she's been asking questions."</p>
<p>Harry Potter raised his eyebrows. "Who?"</p>
<p>"She writes for the <em>Daily Prophet,</em>" Draco said. He
tried to keep the worry out of his voice. The <em>Daily
Prophet</em> was one of Father's primary tools, he used it like a
wizard's wand. "That's the newspaper people actually pay attention
to. Rita Skeeter writes about celebrities, and as she puts it, uses
her quill to puncture their over-inflated reputations. If she can't
find any rumors about you, she'll just make up her own."</p>
<p>"I <em>see,</em>" said Harry Potter. His green-lit face looked
very thoughtful beneath the cowl.</p>
<p>Draco hesitated before saying what he had to say next. By now
someone had certainly reported to Father that he was courting Harry
Potter, and Father would also know that Draco hadn't written home
about it, and Father would understand that Draco didn't think he
could actually keep it a secret, which sent a clear message that
Draco was practicing his own game now but still on Father's side,
since if Draco had been tempted away, he would have been sending
false reports.</p>
<p>It followed that Father had probably anticipated what Draco was
about to say next.</p>
<p>Playing the game with Father for real was a rather unnerving
sensation. Even if they were on the same side. It was, on the one
hand, exhiliarating, but Draco also knew that in the end it would
turn out that Father had played the game better. There was no other
way it could possibly go.</p>
<p>"Harry," Draco finally said. "This isn't a suggestion. This
isn't my advice. Just the way it is. My father could almost
certainly quash that article. But it would cost you."</p>
<p>That Father had been expecting Draco to tell Harry Potter
exactly that was not something Draco said out loud. Harry Potter
would work it out on his own, or not.</p>
<p>But instead Harry Potter shook his head, smiling beneath the
cowl. "I have no intention of trying to quash Rita Skeeter."</p>
<p>Draco didn't even try to keep the incredulity out of his voice.
"You <em>can't</em> tell me you don't care what the
<em>newspaper</em> says about you!"</p>
<p>"I care less than you might think," said Harry Potter. "But I
have my own ways of dealing with the likes of Skeeter. I don't need
Lucius's help."</p>
<p>A worried look came over Draco's face before he could stop it.
Whatever Harry Potter was about to do next, it would be something
Father wasn't expecting, and Draco was feeling very nervous about
where that might lead.</p>
<p>Draco also realized that his hair was getting sweaty underneath
the cowl. He'd never actually worn one of those before, and hadn't
realized that the Death Eaters' cloaks probably had things like
Cooling Charms.</p>
<p>Harry Potter wiped some sweat from his forehead again, grimaced,
took out his wand, pointed it upward, took a deep breath, and said
"<em>Frigideiro!</em> "</p>
<p>Moments later Draco felt the cold draft.</p>
<p>"<em>Frigideiro! Frigideiro! Frigideiro! Frigideiro!
Frigideiro!</em> "</p>
<p>Then Harry Potter lowered the wand, though his hand seemed a bit
shaky, and put it back into his robes.</p>
<p>The whole room seemed perceptibly cooler. Draco could have done
that too, but still, not bad.</p>
<p>"So," Draco said. "Science. You're going to tell me about
blood."</p>
<p>"We're going to <em>find out</em> about blood," Harry Potter
said. "By doing experiments."</p>
<p>"All right," Draco said. "What sort of experiments?"</p>
<p>Harry Potter smiled evilly beneath his cowl, and said, "You tell
me."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Draco had heard of something called the Socratic Method, which
was teaching by asking questions (named after an ancient
philosopher who had been too smart to be a real Muggle and hence
had been a disguised pureblood wizard). One of his tutors had used
Socratic teaching a lot. It had been annoying but effective.</p>
<p>Then there was the Potter Method, which was insane.</p>
<p>To be fair, Draco had to admit that Harry Potter had tried the
Socratic Method first and it hadn't been working too well.</p>
<p>Harry Potter had asked how Draco would go about
<em>disproving</em> the blood purist hypothesis that wizards
couldn't do the neat stuff now that they'd done eight centuries ago
because they had interbred with Muggleborns and Squibs.</p>
<p>Draco had said that he did not understand how Harry Potter could
sit there with a straight face and claim this was not a trap.</p>
<p>Harry Potter had replied, still with a straight face, that if it
was a trap it would have been so pathetically obvious that
<em>he</em> ought to be ground up and fed to pet snakes, but it was
<em>not</em> a trap, it was simply a rule of how scientists
operated that you had to try to disprove your own theories, and if
you made an honest effort and failed, that was victory.</p>
<p>Draco had tried to point out the staggering stupidity of this by
suggesting that the key to surviving a duel was to cast Avada
Kedavra on your own foot and miss.</p>
<p>Harry Potter had <em>nodded</em>.</p>
<p>Draco had shaken his head.</p>
<p>Harry Potter had then presented the idea that scientists watched
ideas fight to see which ones won, and you <em>couldn't fight
without an opponent,</em> so Draco needed to figure out opponents
for the blood purist hypothesis to fight so that blood purism could
win, which Draco understood a little better even though Harry
Potter had said it with a rather distasteful look. Like, it was
clear that if blood purism was the way the world really was, then
the sky just had to be blue, and if some other theory was true, the
sky just had to be green; and nobody had seen the sky yet; and then
you went outside and looked and the blood purists won; and after
this had happened six times in a row, people would start noticing
the trend.</p>
<p>Harry Potter had then proceeded to claim that all the opponents
Draco was inventing were too weak, so blood purism wouldn't get
credit for defeating them because the battle wouldn't be impressive
enough. Draco had understood that too. <em>Wizards have gotten
weaker because house elves are stealing our magic</em> hadn't
sounded impressive to him either.</p>
<p>(Though Harry Potter <em>had</em> said that one at least was
testable, in that they could try to check if house elves had gotten
stronger over time, and even draw a picture representing the
increasing strength of house elves and another picture representing
the decreasing strength of wizards and if the two pictures matched
that would point to the house elves, all said in such completely
serious tones that Draco had felt an impulse to ask Dobby a few
pointed questions under Veritaserum before snapping out of it.)</p>
<p>And Harry Potter had finally said that Draco <em>couldn't</em>
fix the battle, scientists weren't dumb, it would be
<em>obvious</em> if you fixed the battle, it had to be a <em>real
fight,</em> between two different theories that might both
<em>really</em> be true, with a test that only the <em>true</em>
hypothesis would win, something that actually <em>would</em> come
out different ways depending on which hypothesis was actually
correct, and there would be experienced scientists watching to make
sure that was exactly what happened. Harry Potter had claimed that
he himself just wanted to know <em>how blood really worked</em> and
for that he need to see blood purism <em>really win</em> and Draco
wasn't going to fool <em>him</em> with theories that were just
there to be knocked down.</p>
<p>Even having seen the point, Draco hadn't been able to invent any
"plausible alternatives", as Harry Potter put it, to the idea that
wizards were getting less powerful because they were mixing their
blood with mud. It was too obviously true.</p>
<p>It was then that Harry Potter had said, rather frustrated, that
he couldn't imagine Draco was <em>really</em> this bad at
considering different viewpoints, <em>surely</em> there'd been
Death Eaters who'd posed as enemies of blood purism and had come up
with much more plausible-sounding arguments against their own side
than Draco was offering. If Draco had been trying to pose as a
member of Dumbledore's faction, and come up with the house elf
hypothesis, he wouldn't have fooled anyone for a second.</p>
<p>Draco had been forced to admit this was a point.</p>
<p>Hence the Potter Method.</p>
<p>"Please, Dr. Malfoy," whined Harry Potter, "why won't you accept
my paper?"</p>
<p>Harry Potter had needed to repeat the phrase "just pretend to be
pretending to be a scientist" three times before Draco had
understood.</p>
<p>In that moment Draco had realized that there was something
deeply <em>wrong</em> with Harry Potter's brain, and anyone who
tried Legilimency on it would probably never come back out
again.</p>
<p>Harry Potter had then gone into further and considerable detail:
Draco was to pretend to be a Death Eater who was posing as the
editor of a scientific journal, Dr. Malfoy, who wanted to reject
his enemy Dr. Potter's paper "On the Heritability of Magical
Ability", and if the Death Eater didn't act like a real scientist
would, he would be revealed as a Death Eater and executed, while
Dr. Malfoy was also being watched by his own rivals and needed to
<em>appear</em> to reject Dr. Potter's paper for neutral scientific
reasons or he would lose his position as journal editor.</p>
<p>It was a wonder the Sorting Hat wasn't gibbering madly in St.
Mungo's.</p>
<p>It was also the most complicated thing anyone had <em>ever</em>
asked Draco to pretend and there was no possible way he could have
refused the challenge.</p>
<p>Right now they were, as Harry Potter had put it, getting in the
mood.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid, Dr. Potter, that you wrote this in the wrong color
of ink," Draco said. "Next!"</p>
<p>Dr. Potter's face did an excellent job of crumpling in despair,
and Draco couldn't help but feel a flash of Dr. Malfoy's glee, even
though the Death Eater was only pretending to be Dr. Malfoy.</p>
<p>This part was <em>fun.</em> He could have done this all day
long.</p>
<p>Dr. Potter got up from the chair, slumped over in dismay, and
trudged off, and turned into Harry Potter, who gave Draco a
thumbs-up, and then turned back into Dr. Potter again, now
approaching with an eager smile.</p>
<p>Dr. Potter sat down and presented Dr. Malfoy with a piece of
parchment on which was written:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>On the Heritability of Magical
Ability</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Dr. H. J. Potter-Evans-Verres,
Institute for Sufficiently Advanced Science</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>My observation:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Today's wizards can't do things
as impressive as<br>
what wizards used to do 800 years ago.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>My conclusion:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Wizardkind has become weaker by
mixing<br>
their blood with Muggleborns and Squibs.</em></p>
<p>"Dr. Malfoy," said Dr. Potter with a hopeful look, "I was
wondering if the <em>Journal of Irreproducible Results</em> could
consider for publication my paper entitled 'On the Heritability of
Magical Ability'."</p>
<p>Draco looked at the parchment, smiling while he considered
possible rejections. If he was a professor, he would have refused
the essay as too short, so -</p>
<p>"It's too long, Dr. Potter," said Dr. Malfoy.</p>
<p>For a moment there was genuine incredulity on Dr. Potter's
face.</p>
<p>"Ah..." said Dr. Potter. "How about if I get rid of the separate
lines for observations and conclusions, and just put in a
<em>therefore</em> -"</p>
<p>"Then it'll be too short. Next!"</p>
<p>Dr. Potter trudged off.</p>
<p>"All right," said Harry Potter, "you're getting <em>too</em>
good at this. Two more times to practice, and then third time is
for real, no interruptions between, I'll just come in straight at
you and that time you'll reject the paper based on the actual
content, remember, your scientific rivals are watching."</p>
<p>Dr. Potter's next paper was perfect in every way, a marvel of
its kind, but unfortunately had to be rejected because Dr. Malfoy's
journal was having trouble with the letter E. Dr. Potter offered to
rewrite it without those words, and Dr. Malfoy explained that it
was really more of a vowel problem.</p>
<p>The paper after that was rejected because it was Tuesday.</p>
<p>It was, in fact, Saturday.</p>
<p>Dr. Potter tried to point this out and was told "Next!"</p>
<p>(Draco was starting to understand why Snape had used his hold
over Dumbledore just to get a position that let him be awful to
students.)</p>
<p>And then -</p>
<p>Dr. Potter was approaching with a superior smirk on his
face.</p>
<p>"This is my latest paper, <em>On the Heritability of Magical
Ability,</em>" Dr. Potter stated confidently, and thrust out the
parchment. "I have decided to allow your journal to publish it, and
have prepared it in perfect accordance with your guidelines so that
you may publish it quickly."</p>
<p>The Death Eater decided to track down and kill Dr. Potter after
his mission was done. Dr. Malfoy kept a polite smile on his face,
since his rivals were watching, and said...</p>
<p>(The pause stretched, with Dr. Potter looking at him
impatiently.)</p>
<p>..."Let me look at that, please."</p>
<p>Dr. Malfoy took the parchment and perused it carefully.</p>
<p>The Death Eater was starting to get nervous about the fact that
he wasn't a real scientist, and Draco was trying to remember how to
talk like Harry Potter.</p>
<p>"You, ah, need to consider other possible explanations for your,
um, observation, besides just this one -"</p>
<p>"Really?" interrupted Dr. Potter. "Like what, exactly? <em>House
elves are stealing our magic?</em> My data admit of only one
possible conclusion, Dr. Malfoy. There <em>are</em> no other
plausible hypotheses."</p>
<p>Draco was trying furiously to order his brain to think, what
would he say if he was posing as a member of Dumbledore's faction,
what <em>did</em> they claim was the explanation for wizardkind's
decline, Draco had never bothered to actually ask that...</p>
<p>"If you can't think of any other way to explain my data, you'll
have to publish my paper, <em>Dr. Malfoy.</em>"</p>
<p>It was the sneer on Dr. Potter's face that did it.</p>
<p>"Oh yeah?" snapped Dr. Malfoy. "How do you know that magic
itself isn't fading away?"</p>
<p>Time stopped.</p>
<p>Draco and Harry Potter exchanged looks of appalled horror.</p>
<p>Then Harry Potter spat something that was probably an extremely
bad word if you'd been raised by Muggles. "<em>I didn't think of
that!</em> " said Harry Potter. "And I should have. The magic goes
away. <em>Damn, damn, damn!</em> "</p>
<p>The alarm in Harry Potter's voice was contagious. Without even
thinking about it, Draco's hand went into his robes and clutched at
his wand. He'd thought the House of Malfoy was <em>safe,</em> so
long as you only married into families that could trace their
bloodlines back four generations you were supposed to be
<em>safe,</em> it had never occurred to him before that there might
be nothing anyone could do to stop the end of magic. "Harry, what
do we do?" Draco's voice was rising in panic. "<em>What do we
do?</em> "</p>
<p>"<em>Let me think!</em> "</p>
<p>After a few moments, Harry grabbed from a nearby desk the same
quill and roll of parchment he'd used to write his pretend paper,
and started scribbling something.</p>
<p>"We'll figure it out," Harry said, his voice tight, "if magic is
fading out of the world we'll figure out how fast it's fading and
how much time we have left to do something, and then we'll figure
out why it's fading, and then we'll do something about it. Draco,
have wizarding powers been declining at a steady rate, or have
there been sudden drops?"</p>
<p>"I... I don't know..."</p>
<p>"You told me that no one had matched the four founders of
Hogwarts. So it's been going on for at least eight centuries, then?
You can't remember hearing anything about the problems suddenly
appearing five centuries ago or anything like that?"</p>
<p>Draco was trying frantically to think. "I always heard that
nobody was as good as Merlin and then after that nobody was as good
as the Founders of Hogwarts."</p>
<p>"All right," Harry said. He was still scribbling. "Because three
centuries ago is when Muggles started to not believe in magic,
which I thought might have something to do with it. And about a
century and a half ago was when Muggles began using a kind of
technology that stops working around magic and I was wondering if
it might also go the other way around."</p>
<p>Draco exploded out of his chair, so angry he could hardly even
speak. "It's the <em>Muggles</em> -"</p>
<p>"<em>Damn it!</em> " roared Harry. "Weren't you even listening
to <em>yourself?</em> It's been going on for eight centuries at
least and the Muggles weren't doing anything interesting then!
<em>We have to figure out the real truth!</em> The Muggles
<em>might</em> have something to do with this but if they
<em>don't</em> and you go blaming everything on them and that stops
us from figuring out what's <em>really</em> going on then one day
you're going to wake up in the morning and find out that your wand
is just a stick of wood!"</p>
<p>Draco's breath stopped in his throat. His father often said
<em>our wands will break in our hands</em> in his speeches but
Draco had never really thought before about what that
<em>meant</em>, it wasn't going to happen to <em>him</em> after
all. And now suddenly it seemed very real. <em>Just a stick of
wood.</em> Draco could imagine just what it would be like to take
out his wand and try to cast a spell and find that nothing was
happening...</p>
<p>That could happen to <em>everyone</em>.</p>
<p>There would be no more wizards, no more magic, ever. Just
Muggles who had a few legends about what their ancestors had been
able to do. Some of the Muggles would be called Malfoy, and that
would be all that was left of the name.</p>
<p>For the first time in his life, Draco realized why there were
Death Eaters.</p>
<p>He'd always taken for granted that becoming a Death Eater was
something you did when you grew up. Now Draco <em>understood</em>,
he knew why Father and Father's friends had sworn to give their
lives to prevent the nightmare from coming to pass, there were
things you couldn't just stand by and watch happen. But what if it
was going to happen <em>anyway</em>, what if all the sacrifices,
all the friends they'd lost to Dumbledore, the <em>family</em>
they'd lost, what if it had all been for <em>nothing...</em></p>
<p>"Magic <em>can't</em> be fading away," Draco said. His voice was
breaking. "It wouldn't be <em>fair</em>."</p>
<p>Harry stopped scribbling and looked up. His face had an angry
expression. "Your father never told you that life isn't fair?"</p>
<p>Father had said that every single time Draco used the word.
"But, but, it's too awful to believe that -"</p>
<p>"Draco, let me introduce you to something I call the Litany of
Tarski. It changes every time you use it. On this occasion it runs
like so: <em>If magic is fading out of the world, I want to believe
that magic is fading out of the world. If magic is not fading out
of the world, I want not to believe that magic is fading out of the
world. Let me not become attached to beliefs I may not want.</em>
If we're living in a world where magic is fading, <em>that's what
we have to believe,</em> we have to know what's coming, so we can
stop it, or in the very worst case, be prepared to do what we can
in the time we have left. Not believing it won't stop it from
happening. So the <em>only</em> question we have to ask is whether
magic is <em>actually</em> fading, and if that's the world we live
in then that's what we want to believe. Litany of Gendlin:
<em>What's true is already so, owning up to it doesn't make it
worse.</em> Got that, Draco? I'm going to make you memorize it
later. It's something you repeat to yourself any time you start
wondering if it's a good idea to believe something that isn't
actually true. In fact I want you to say it right now. <em>What's
true is already so, owning up to it doesn't make it worse.</em> Say
it."</p>
<p>"What's true is already so," repeated Draco, his voice
trembling, "owning up to it doesn't make it worse."</p>
<p>"If magic is fading, I want to believe that magic is fading. If
magic is not fading, I want not to believe that magic is fading.
Say it."</p>
<p>Draco repeated back the words, the sickness churning in his
stomach.</p>
<p>"Good," Harry said, "remember, it might <em>not</em> be
happening, and then you won't have to believe it, either.
<em>First</em> we just want to know what's actually going on, which
world we actually live in." Harry turned back to his work,
scribbled some more, and then turned the parchment so Draco could
see it. Draco leaned over the desk and Harry brought the green
light closer.</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Observation:</span></em></p>
<p><em>Wizardry isn't as powerful now as it was when Hogwarts was
founded.</em></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Hypotheses:</span></em></p>
<p><em>1. Magic itself is fading.<br>
2. Wizards are interbreeding with Muggles and Squibs.<br>
3. Knowledge to cast powerful spells is being lost.</em><em><br>
4. Wizards are eating the wrong foods as children, or something
else besides blood is making them grow up weaker.<br>
5. Muggle technology is interfering with magic. (Since 800 years
ago?)<br>
6. Stronger wizards are having fewer children. (Draco = only child?
Check if 3 powerful wizards, Quirrell / Dumbledore / Dark Lord, had
any children.)</em></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Tests:</span></em></p>
<p>"All right," Harry said. His breathing sounded a little calmer.
"Now when you're dealing with a confusing problem and you have no
idea what's going on, the smart thing to do is figure out some
really simple tests, things you can look at right away. We need
fast tests that distinguish between these hypotheses. Observations
that would come out a different way for at least one of them
compared to all the other ones."</p>
<p>Draco stared at the list in shock. He was suddenly realizing
that he knew an awful lot of purebloods who were only children.
Himself, Vincent, Gregory, practically <em>everyone.</em> The two
most powerful wizards everyone talked about were Dumbledore and the
Dark Lord and neither had any children just like Harry had
suspected...</p>
<p>"It's going to be really hard to distinguish between 2 and 6,"
Harry said, "it's in the blood either way, you'd have to try and
track the decline of wizardry and compare that to how many kids
different wizards were having and measure the abilities of
Muggleborns compared to purebloods..." Harry's fingers were tapping
nervously on the desk. "Let's just lump 6 in with 2 and call them
the blood hypothesis for now. 4 is unlikely because then everyone
would notice a sudden drop when the wizards switched to new foods,
it's hard to see what would've changed steadily over 800 years. 5
is unlikely for the same reason, no sudden drop, Muggles weren't
doing anything 800 years back. 4 looks like 2 and 5 looks like 1
anyway. So mainly we should be trying to distinguish between 1, 2,
and 3." Harry turned the parchment to himself, drew an ellipse
around those three numbers, turned it back. "Magic is fading, blood
is weakening, knowledge is disappearing. What test comes out
differently depending on which of those is true? What could we see
that would mean any one of these was false?"</p>
<p>"<em>I</em> don't know!" blurted Draco. "Why are you asking me?
You're the scientist!"</p>
<p>"Draco," Harry said, a note of pleading desperation in his
voice, "I only know what Muggle scientists know! You grew up in the
wizarding world, I didn't! You know more magic than I do and you
know more <em>about</em> magic than I do and you thought of this
whole idea in the first place, so start thinking like a scientist
and solve this!"</p>
<p>Draco swallowed hard and stared at the paper.</p>
<p>Magic is fading... wizards are interbreeding with Muggles...
knowledge is being lost...</p>
<p>"What does the world look like if magic is fading?" said Harry
Potter. "You know more about magic, you should be the one guessing
not me! Imagine you're telling a story about it, what happens in
the story?"</p>
<p>Draco imagined it. "Charms that used to work stop working."
<em>Wizards wake up and find that their wands are sticks of
wood...</em></p>
<p>"What does the world look like if the wizarding blood gets
weaker?"</p>
<p>"People can't do things their ancestors could do."</p>
<p>"What does the world look like if knowledge is being lost?"</p>
<p>"People don't know how to cast the Charms in the first place..."
said Draco. He stopped, surprised at himself. "That's a test, isn't
it?"</p>
<p>Harry nodded decisively. "That's one." He wrote it down on the
parchment under <em>Tests:</em></p>
<p><em>A. Are there spells we know but can't cast (1 or 2) or are
the lost spells no longer known (3)?</em></p>
<p>"So that distinguishes between 1 and 2 on the one hand, and 3 on
the other hand," said Harry. "Now we need some way to distinguish
between 1 and 2. Magic fading, blood weakening, how could we tell
the difference?"</p>
<p>"What kind of Charms did students used to cast in their first
year at Hogwarts?" said Draco. "If they used to be able to cast
much more powerful Charms, the blood was stronger -"</p>
<p>Harry Potter shook his head. "Or magic itself was stronger. We
have to figure out some way of telling the <em>difference.</em>"
Harry stood up from his chair, began pacing nervously through the
classroom. "No, wait, that might still work. Suppose different
spells use up different amounts of magical energy. Then if the
ambient magic weakened, the powerful spells would die first, but
the spells everyone learns in their first year would stay the
same..." Harry's nervous pacing sped up. "It's not a very good
test, it's more about powerful wizardry being lost versus all
wizardry being lost, someone's blood could be too weak for powerful
wizardry but strong enough for easy spells... Draco, do you know if
more powerful wizards within a <em>single</em> era, like powerful
wizards from just this century, are more powerful as children? If
the Dark Lord had cast the Cooling Charm when he was eleven, could
he have frozen the whole room?"</p>
<p>Draco's face screwed up as he tried to recollect. "I can't
remember hearing anything about the Dark Lord but I think
Dumbledore's supposed to have done something amazing on his
Transfiguration O.W.L.s in fifth year... I think other powerful
wizards were good in Hogwarts too..."</p>
<p>Harry scowled, still pacing. "They could just be studying hard.
Still, if first-year students learned the same spells and seemed
about as powerful then as now, we could call that <em>weak</em>
evidence favoring 1 over 2... wait, hold on." Harry stopped where
he stood. "I have another test that might distinguish between 1 and
2. It would take a while to explain, it uses some things that
scientists know about blood and inheritance, but it's an easy
question to ask. And if we <em>combine</em> my test and your test
and they both come out the same way, that's a strong hint at the
answer." Harry almost ran back to the desk, took the parchment and
wrote:</p>
<p><em>B. Did ancient first-year students cast the same sort of
spells, with the same power, as now? (Weak evidence for 1 over 2,
but blood could also be losing powerful wizardry only.)</em></p>
<p><em>C. Additional test that distinguishes 1 and 2 using
scientific knowledge of blood, will explain later.</em></p>
<p>"Okay," said Harry, "we can at least try to tell the difference
between 1 and 2 and 3, so let's go with this right away, we can
figure out <em>more</em> tests after we do the ones we already
have. Now it's going to look a little odd if Draco Malfoy and Harry
Potter go around asking questions together, so here's my idea.
You'll go through Hogwarts and find old portraits and ask them
about what spells they learned to cast during their first years.
They're portraits so they won't know there's anything odd about
Draco Malfoy doing that. I'll ask recent portraits and living
people about spells we know but can't cast, no one will notice
anything unusual if Harry Potter asks weird questions. And I'll
have to do complicated research about forgotten spells, so I want
you to be the one to gather the data I need for my own scientific
question. It's a simple question and you should be able to find the
answer by asking portraits. You might want to write this down,
ready?"</p>
<p>Draco sat down again and scrabbled in his bookbag for parchment
and quill. When it was laid down on the desk, Draco looked up, face
determined. "Go ahead."</p>
<p>"Find portraits who knew a married Squib couple - don't make
that face, Draco, it's important information. Just ask recent
portraits who are Gryffindors or something. Find portraits who knew
a married Squib couple well enough to know the names of all their
children. Write down the name of each child and whether that child
was a wizard, a Squib, or a Muggle. If they don't know whether the
child was a Squib or a Muggle, write down 'non-wizard'. Write that
down for <em>every</em> child the couple had, don't leave any out.
If the portrait only knows the name of the wizarding children, not
the names of <em>all</em> the children, then don't write down
<em>any</em> data from that couple. It's very important that you
only bring me data from someone who knows <em>all</em> the children
a Squib couple had, well enough to know them all by name. Try to
get at least forty names total, if you can, and if you have time
for more, even better. Have you got all that?"</p>
<p>"Repeat it," Draco said, when he was done writing, and Harry
repeated it.</p>
<p>"I've got it," Draco said, "but why -"</p>
<p>"It has to do with one of the secrets of blood that scientists
already discovered. I'll explain when you get back. Let's split up
and meet back here in an hour, 6:22pm that should be. Are we ready
to go?"</p>
<p>Draco nodded decisively. It was all very rushed, but he'd long
since been taught how to rush.</p>
<p>"Then <em>go!</em> " said Harry Potter and yanked off his cowled
cloak and shoved it into his pouch, which began eating it, and,
without even waiting for his pouch to finish, spun around and began
striding rapidly toward the classroom door, bumping into a desk and
almost falling over in his haste.</p>
<p>By the time Draco had managed to get his own cloak off and stow
it in his bookbag, Harry Potter was gone.</p>
<p>Draco almost ran out the door.</p>

<p>Rowling is whoever does Rowling's job.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Hermione Granger had worried she was turning Bad.</p>
<p>The difference between Good and Bad was usually easy to grasp,
she'd never understood why other people had so much trouble. At
Hogwarts, "Good" was Professor Flitwick and Professor McGonagall
and Professor Sprout. "Bad" was Professor Snape and Professor
Quirrell and Draco Malfoy. Harry Potter... was one of those unusual
cases where you <em>couldn't</em> tell just by looking. She was
still trying to figure out where he belonged.</p>
<p>But when it came to <em>herself</em>...</p>
<p>Hermione was having <em>too much fun</em> crushing Harry
Potter.</p>
<p>She'd done better than him in every single class they'd taken.
(Except for broomstick riding which was like gym class, it didn't
count.) She'd gotten <em>real</em> House points almost every day of
their first week, not for weird heroic things, but <em>smart</em>
things like learning spells quickly and helping other students. She
knew those kinds of House points were better, and the best part
was, Harry Potter knew it too. She could see it in his eyes every
time she won another <em>real</em> House point.</p>
<p>If you were Good, you weren't supposed to enjoy winning this
much.</p>
<p>It had started on the day of the train ride, though it had taken
a while for the whirlwind to sink in. It wasn't until later that
night that Hermione had begun to realize just <em>how much</em>
she'd let that boy walk all over her.</p>
<p>Before she'd met Harry Potter she hadn't had anyone she'd wanted
to crush. If someone wasn't doing as well as her in class, it was
her job to help them, not rub it in. That was what it meant to be
Good.</p>
<p>And now...</p>
<p>...now she was <em>winning</em>, Harry Potter was flinching
every time she got another House point, and it was <em>so much</em>
fun, her parents had warned her against drugs and she suspected
this was <em>more fun</em> than that.</p>
<p>She'd always liked the smiles that teachers gave her when she
did something right. She'd always liked seeing the long row of
check-marks on a perfectly answered test. But now when she did well
in class she would casually glance around and catch a glimpse of
Harry Potter gritting his teeth, and it made her want to burst into
song like a Disney movie.</p>
<p>That was Bad, wasn't it?</p>
<p>Hermione had worried she was turning Bad.</p>
<p>And then a thought had come to her which wiped away all her
fears.</p>
<p>She and Harry were getting into a Romance! Of course! Everyone
knew what it meant when a boy and a girl started fighting all the
time. They were <em>courting</em> one another! There was nothing
Bad about <em>that.</em></p>
<p>It couldn't be that she just <em>enjoyed</em> beating the living
scholastic daylights out of the most famous student in the school,
someone who was <em>in</em> books and <em>talked</em> like books,
the boy who had somehow vanquished the Dark Lord and even smushed
<em>Professor Snape</em> like a sad little bug, the boy who was, as
Professor Quirrell would have put it, dominant, over everyone else
in first-year Ravenclaw <em>except</em> for Hermione Granger who
was utterly <em>squishing</em> the Boy-Who-Lived in all his classes
besides broomstick riding.</p>
<p>Because that would have been Bad.</p>
<p>No. It was Romance. <em>That</em> was it. <em>That</em> was why
they were fighting.</p>
<p>Hermione was glad she had figured this out in time for today,
when Harry would lose their book-reading contest, which the
<em>whole school</em> knew about, and she wanted to start
<em>dancing</em> with the sheer overflowing joy of it.</p>
<p>It was 2:45pm on Saturday and Harry Potter had half of Bathilda
Bagshot's <em>A History of Magic</em> left to read and she was
staring at her pocket watch as it ticked with dreadful slowness
toward 2:47pm.</p>
<p>And the entire Ravenclaw common room was watching.</p>
<p>It wasn't just the first-years, news had spread like spilled
milk and fully half of Ravenclaw was crowded into the room,
squeezed into sofas and leaning on bookcases and sitting on the
arms of chairs. All six prefects were there including the Head Girl
of Hogwarts. Someone had needed to cast an Air-Freshening Charm
just so that there would be enough oxygen. And the din of
conversation had died into whispers which had now faded into utter
silence.</p>
<p>2:46pm.</p>
<p>The tension was unbearable. If it had been anyone else,
<em>anyone</em> else, his defeat would have been a foregone
conclusion.</p>
<p>But this was Harry Potter, and you couldn't rule out the
possibility that he would, sometime in the next few seconds, raise
a hand and snap his fingers.</p>
<p>With sudden terror she realized how Harry Potter might be able
to do exactly that. It would be <em>just like him</em> to have
<em>already finished reading</em> the second half of the book
earlier...</p>
<p>Hermione's vision began to swim. She tried to make herself
breathe, and found that she simply couldn't.</p>
<p>Ten seconds left, and he still hadn't raised his hand.</p>
<p>Five seconds left.</p>
<p>2:47pm.</p>
<p>Harry Potter carefully placed a bookmark into his book, closed
it, and laid it aside.</p>
<p>"I would like to note for the benefit of posterity," said the
Boy-Who-Lived in a clear voice, "that I had only half a book left,
and that I ran into a number of unexpected delays -"</p>
<p>"<em>You lost!</em> " shrieked Hermione. "You <em>did!</em> You
<em>lost our contest!</em> "</p>
<p>There was a collective exhalation as everyone started breathing
again.</p>
<p>Harry Potter shot her a Look of Flaming Fire, but she was
floating in a halo of pure white happiness and nothing could touch
her.</p>
<p>"<em>Do you realize what kind of week I've had?</em> " said
Harry Potter. "Any lesser being would have been hard-pressed to
read eight Dr. Seuss books!"</p>
<p>"<em>You</em> set the time limit."</p>
<p>Harry's Look of Flaming Fire grew even hotter. "I did not have
any logical way of knowing I'd have to save the entire school from
Professor Snape, or get beaten up in Defense class, and if I told
you how I lost all the time between 5pm and dinner on Thursday you
would think I was insane -"</p>
<p>"Awww, it sounds like <em>someone</em> fell prey to the
<em>planning fallacy.</em>"</p>
<p>Raw shock showed on Harry Potter's face.</p>
<p>"Oh that reminds me, I finished reading the first batch of books
you lent me," Hermione said with her best innocent look. A couple
of them had been <em>hard</em> books, too. She wondered how long it
had taken <em>him</em> to finish reading them.</p>
<p>"Someday," said the Boy-Who-Lived, "when the distant descendants
of <em>Homo sapiens</em> are looking back over the history of the
galaxy and wondering how it all went so wrong, they will conclude
that the original mistake was when someone taught Hermione Granger
how to read."</p>
<p>"But you still lose," said Hermione. She held a hand to her chin
and looked contemplative. "Now what exactly should you lose, I
wonder?"</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> "</p>
<p>"You lost the bet," Hermione explained, "so you have to pay a
forfeit."</p>
<p>"I don't remember agreeing to this!"</p>
<p>"Really?" said Hermione Granger. She put a thoughtful look on
her face. Then, as if the idea had only just then occurred to her,
"We'll take a vote, then. Everyone in Ravenclaw who thinks Harry
Potter has to pay up, raise your hand!"</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " shrieked Harry Potter again.</p>
<p>He spun around and saw that he was surrounded by a sea of raised
hands.</p>
<p>And if Harry Potter had looked <em>more carefully</em>, he would
have noticed that an awful lot of the onlookers seemed to be girls
and that practically every female in the room had their hand
raised.</p>
<p>"Stop!" wailed Harry Potter. "You don't know what she's going to
ask! Don't you <em>realize</em> what she's doing? She's getting you
to make an advance commitment now, and then the pressure of
consistency will make you agree with whatever she says
afterward!"</p>
<p>"Don't worry," said the prefect Penelope Clearwater. "If she
asks for something unreasonable, we can just change our minds.
Right, everyone?"</p>
<p>And there were eager nods from all the girls whom Penelope
Clearwater had told about Hermione's plan.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>A silent figure quietly slipped through the chilled halls of the
Hogwarts dungeons. He was to be present in a certain room at 6:00pm
to meet a certain someone, and if at all possible it was best to be
early, to show respect.</p>
<p>But when his hand turned the doorknob and opened the door into
that dark, silent, unused classroom, there was a silhouette already
standing there amid the rows of dusty old desks. A silhouette which
held a small green glowing rod, casting a pale light which hardly
illuminated even he who held it, let alone the surrounding
room.</p>
<p>The light of the hallway died as the door closed and shut behind
him, and Draco's eyes began the process of adjusting to the dim
glow.</p>
<p>The silhouette slowly turned to behold him, revealing a shadowed
face only partially lit by the eerie green light.</p>
<p>Draco liked this meeting already. Keep the chill green light,
make them both taller, give them hoods and masks, move them from a
classroom to a graveyard, and it would be just like the start of
half the stories his father's friends told about the Death
Eaters.</p>
<p>"I want you to know, Draco Malfoy," said the silhouette in tones
of deadly calm, "that I do not blame you for my recent defeat."</p>
<p>Draco opened his mouth in unthinking protest, there was no
possible reason why he <em>should</em> be blamed -</p>
<p>"It was due, more than anything else, to my own stupidity,"
continued that shadowy figure. "There were many other things I
could have done, at any step along the way. You did not ask me to
do <em>exactly</em> what I did. You only asked for help. I was the
one who unwisely chose that particular method. But the fact remains
that I lost the contest by half a book. The actions of your pet
idiot, and the favor you asked for, and, yes, my own foolishness in
going about it, caused me to <em>lose time</em>. More time than you
know. Time which, in the end, proved critical. The fact remains,
Draco Malfoy, that if you had not asked that favor, I
<em>would</em> have won. And not... instead... <em>lost</em>."</p>
<p>Draco had already heard about Harry's loss, and the forfeit
Granger had claimed from him. The news had spread faster than owls
could have carried it.</p>
<p>"I understand," Draco said. "I'm sorry." There was nothing else
he <em>could</em> say if he wanted Harry Potter to be friends with
him.</p>
<p>"I am not asking for understanding or sorrow," said the dark
silhouette, still with that deadly calm. "But I have just spent two
full hours in the presence of Hermione Granger, dressed in such
clothing as was provided me, visiting such fascinating places in
Hogwarts as a tiny burbling waterfall of what looked to me like
snot, accompanied by a number of other girls who insisted on such
helpful activities as strewing our path with Transfigured rose
petals. I have been on a date, scion of Malfoy. My <em>first</em>
date. <em>And when I call that favor due, you will pay
it.</em>"</p>
<p>Draco nodded solemnly. Before arriving he had taken the wise
precaution of learning every available detail of Harry's date, so
that he could get all of his hysterical laughing done before their
appointed meeting time, and would not commit a <em>faux pas</em> by
giggling continuously until he lost consciousness.</p>
<p>"Do you think," Draco said, "that something sad ought to happen
to the Granger girl -"</p>
<p>"Spread the word in Slytherin that the Granger girl is
<em>mine</em> and anyone who meddles in <em>my</em> affairs will
have their remains scattered over an area wide enough to include
twelve different spoken languages. And since I am not in Gryffindor
and I use <em>cunning</em> rather than immediate frontal attacks,
they should not panic if I am seen smiling at her."</p>
<p>"Or if you're seen on a second date?" Draco said, allowing just
a tiny note of skepticism into his voice.</p>
<p>"<em>There will be no second date,</em>" said the green-lit
silhouette in a voice so fearsome that it sounded, not only like a
Death Eater, but like Amycus Carrow that one time just before
Father told him to stop it, he wasn't the Dark Lord.</p>
<p>Of course it <em>was</em> still a young boy's high unbroken
voice and when you combined that with the <em>actual words</em>,
well, it just didn't work. If Harry Potter <em>did</em> become the
next Dark Lord someday, Draco would use a Pensieve to store a copy
of this memory somewhere safe, and Harry Potter would never dare
betray him.</p>
<p>"But let us talk of happier matters," said the green-shadowed
figure. "Let us talk of knowledge and of power. Draco Malfoy, let
us talk of Science."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Draco. "Let us speak."</p>
<p>Draco wondered how much of his own face could be seen, and how
much was in shadow, in that eerie green light.</p>
<p>And though Draco kept his face serious, there was a smile in his
heart.</p>
<p>He was <em>finally</em> having a real grownup conversation.</p>
<p>"I offer you power," said the shadowy figure, "and I will tell
you of that power and its price. The power comes from knowing the
shape of reality and so gaining control over it. What you
understand, you can command, and that is power enough to walk upon
the Moon. The price of that power is that you must learn to ask
questions of Nature, and far more difficult, accept Nature's
answers. You will do experiments, perform tests and see what
happens. And you must accept the meaning of those results when they
tell you that you are mistaken. You will have to <em>learn how to
lose</em>, not to me, but to Nature. When you find yourself arguing
with reality, you will have to let reality win. You will find this
painful, Draco Malfoy, and I do not know if you are strong in that
way. Knowing the price, is it still your wish to learn the human
power?"</p>
<p>Draco took a deep breath. He'd thought about this. And it was
hard to see how he could answer any other way. He'd been instructed
to take every avenue of friendship with Harry Potter. It was just
<em>learning,</em> he wasn't promising to <em>do</em> anything. He
could always stop the lessons at any time...</p>
<p>There were certainly any number of things about the situation
which made it look like a trap, but in all honesty, Draco didn't
see how this could go wrong.</p>
<p>Plus Draco did kind of want to rule the world.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Draco.</p>
<p>"Excellent," said the shadowy figure. "I have had something of a
<em>crowded week</em>, and it will take time to plan your
curriculum -"</p>
<p>"I've got a lot of things I need to do myself to consolidate my
power in Slytherin," said Draco, "not to mention homework. Maybe we
should just start in October?"</p>
<p>"Sounds sensible," said the shadowy figure, "but what I meant to
say is that to plan your curriculum, I need to know what I will be
teaching you. Three thoughts come to me. The first is that I teach
you of the human mind and brain. The second option is that I teach
you of the physical universe, those arts which lie on the pathway
to visiting the Moon. This involves a great deal of numbers, but to
a certain kind of mind those numbers are more beautiful than
anything else Science has to teach. Do you like numbers,
Draco?"</p>
<p>Draco shook his head.</p>
<p>"Then so much for that. You will learn your mathematics
eventually, but not right away, I think. The third option is that I
teach you of genetics and evolution and inheritance, what you would
call blood -"</p>
<p>"That one," said Draco.</p>
<p>The figure nodded. "I thought you might say as much. But I think
it will be the most painful path for you, Draco. What if your
family and friends, the blood purists, say one thing, and you find
that the experimental test says another?"</p>
<p>"Then I'll figure out how to make the experimental test say the
<em>right</em> answer!"</p>
<p>There was a pause, as the shadowy figure stood there with its
mouth open for a short while.</p>
<p>"Um," said the shadowy figure. "It doesn't really work like
that. That's what I was trying to warn you about here, Draco. You
<em>can't</em> make the answer come out to be anything you
like."</p>
<p>"You can <em>always</em> make the answer come out your way,"
said Draco. That had been practically the first thing his tutors
had taught him. "It's just a matter of finding the right
arguments."</p>
<p>"No," said the shadowy figure, voice rising in frustration, "no,
no, no! Then you get the <em>wrong answer</em> and you can't go to
the Moon that way! Nature isn't a person, you can't trick them into
believing something else, if you try to tell the Moon it's made of
cheese you can argue for days and it won't change the Moon! What
you're talking about is <em>rationalization</em>, like starting
with a sheet of paper, moving straight down to the bottom line,
using ink to write 'and <em>therefore,</em> the Moon is made of
cheese', and then moving back up to write all sorts of clever
arguments above. But either the Moon is made of cheese or it isn't.
The moment you wrote the bottom line, it was already true or
already false. Whether or not the whole sheet of paper ends up with
the right conclusion or the wrong conclusion is fixed the instant
you write down the bottom line. If you're trying to pick between
two expensive trunks, and you like the shiny one, it doesn't matter
what clever arguments you come up with for buying it, the
<em>real</em> rule you used to <em>choose which trunk to argue
for</em> was 'pick the shiny one', and however effective that rule
is at picking good trunks, that's the kind of trunk you'll get.
Rationality <em>can't</em> be used to argue for a fixed side, its
only possible use is <em>deciding which side to argue</em>. Science
isn't for <em>convincing</em> anyone that the blood purists are
right. That's <em>politics!</em> The power of science comes from
<em>finding out the way Nature really is that can't be changed by
arguing!</em> What science <em>can</em> do is tell us <em>how blood
really works,</em> how wizards really inherit their powers from
their parents, and whether Muggleborns are really weaker or
stronger -"</p>
<p>"<em>Stronger!</em> " said Draco. He had been trying to follow
this, a puzzled frown on his face, he could see how it
<em>sort</em> of made sense but it certainly wasn't like anything
he'd ever heard before. And then Harry Potter had said something
Draco couldn't possibly let pass. "You think mudbloods are
<em>stronger?</em> "</p>
<p>"I think nothing," said the shadowy figure. "I know nothing. I
believe nothing. My bottom line is not yet written. I will figure
out how to test the magical strength of Muggleborns, and the
magical strength of purebloods. If my tests tell me that
Muggleborns are weaker, I will believe they are weaker. If my tests
tell me that Muggleborns are stronger, I will believe they are
stronger. Knowing this and other truths, I will gain some measure
of power -"</p>
<p>"And you expect <em>me</em> to believe whatever you say?" Draco
demanded hotly.</p>
<p>"I expect you to perform the tests <em>personally</em>," said
the shadowy figure quietly. "Are you afraid of what <em>you</em>
will find?"</p>
<p>Draco stared at the shadowy figure for a while, his eyes
narrowed. "Nice trap, Harry," he said. "I'll have to remember that
one, it's new."</p>
<p>The shadowy figure shook his head. "It's not a trap, Draco.
Remember - I <em>don't know</em> what we'll find. But you do not
understand the universe by arguing with it or telling it to come
back with a different answer next time. When you put on the robes
of a scientist you must forget all your politics and arguments and
factions and sides, silence the desperate clingings of your mind,
and wish only to hear the answer of Nature." The shadowy figure
paused. "Most people can't do it. That's why this is difficult. Are
you sure you wouldn't rather just learn about the brain?"</p>
<p>"And if I tell you I'd rather learn about the brain," Draco
said, his voice now hard, "you'll go around telling people that I
was afraid of what I'd find."</p>
<p>"No," said the shadowy figure. "I will do no such thing."</p>
<p>"But you might do the same sort of tests yourself, and if you
got the wrong answer, I wouldn't be there to say anything before
you showed it to someone else." Draco's voice was still hard.</p>
<p>"I would still ask you first, Draco," the shadowy figure said
quietly.</p>
<p>Draco paused. He hadn't been expecting that, he'd thought he saw
the trap but... "You <em>would?</em> "</p>
<p>"Of course. How would <em>I</em> know who to blackmail or what
we could ask from them? Draco, I say again that this is not a trap
I set for you. At least not for you personally. If your politics
were different, I would be saying, what if the test shows that
purebloods are stronger."</p>
<p>"Really."</p>
<p>"<em>Yes!</em> That's the price <em>anyone</em> has to pay to
become a scientist!"</p>
<p>Draco held up a hand. He had to think.</p>
<p>The shadowy, green-lit figure waited.</p>
<p>It didn't take long to think about, though. If you discarded all
the confusing parts... then Harry Potter was planning to mess
around with something that could cause a gigantic political
explosion, and it would be insane to just walk away and let him do
it on his own. "We'll study blood," said Draco.</p>
<p>"<em>Excellent</em>," said the figure, and smiled.
"Congratulations on being willing to ask the question."</p>
<p>"Thanks," Draco said, not quite managing to keep the irony out
of his voice.</p>
<p>"Hey, did you think going to the Moon was <em>easy?</em> Be glad
this just involves changing your mind sometimes, and not a human
sacrifice!"</p>
<p>"Human sacrifice would be <em>way</em> easier!"</p>
<p>There was a slight pause, and then the figure nodded. "Fair
point."</p>
<p>"Look, Harry," said Draco without much hope, "I thought the idea
was to take all the things that Muggles know, combine them with
things that wizards know, and become masters of both worlds.
Wouldn't it be a lot easier to just study all the things that
Muggles <em>already</em> found out, like the Moon stuff, and use
<em>that</em> power -"</p>
<p>"<em>No,</em>" said the figure with a sharp shake of his head,
sending green shadows moving around his nose and eyes. His voice
had turned very grim. "If you cannot learn the scientist's art of
accepting reality, then I <em>must not</em> tell you what that
acceptance has discovered. It would be like a powerful wizard
telling you of those gates which must not be opened, and those
seals which must not be broken, before you had proven your
intelligence and discipline by surviving the lesser perils."</p>
<p>A chill went down Draco's spine and he shuddered involuntarily.
He knew it had been visible even in the dim light. "All right,"
said Draco. "I understand." Father had told him that many times.
When a more powerful wizard told you that you weren't ready to
know, you didn't pry any further if you wanted to live.</p>
<p>The figure inclined his head. "Indeed. But there is something
else you should understand. The first scientists, being Muggles,
lacked your traditions. In the beginning they simply did not
comprehend the notion of dangerous knowledge, and thought that all
things known should be spoken freely. When their searches turned
dangerous, they told their politicians of things that should have
stayed secret - don't look like that, Draco, it wasn't simple
stupidity. They did have to be smart enough to uncover the secret
in the first place. But they were Muggles, it was the first time
they'd found anything <em>really</em> dangerous, and they didn't
<em>start out</em> with a tradition of secrecy. There was a war
going on, and the scientists on one side worried that if they
<em>didn't</em> talk, the scientists of the <em>enemy</em> country
would tell <em>their</em> politicians first..." The voice trailed
off significantly. "They didn't destroy the world. But it was
close. And <em>we</em> are not going to repeat that mistake."</p>
<p>"Right," Draco said, his voice now very firm. "<em>We</em>
won't. We're wizards, and studying science doesn't make us
Muggles."</p>
<p>"As you say," said the green-lit silhouette. "We will establish
our <em>own</em> Science, a magical Science, and that Science will
have smarter traditions from the very start." The voice grew hard.
"The knowledge I share with you will be taught alongside the
disciplines of accepting truth, the level of this knowledge will be
keyed to your progress in those disciplines, and you will share
that knowledge with no one else who has not learned those
disciplines. Do you accept this?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Draco. What was he supposed to do, say no?</p>
<p>"Good. And what you discover for yourself, you will keep to
yourself unless you think that other scientists are ready to know
it. What we do share among ourselves, we will not tell the world
unless we agree it is safe for the world to know. And whatever our
own politics and allegiances, we will <em>all</em> punish
<em>any</em> of our number who reveal dangerous magics or give away
dangerous weapons, no matter what sort of war is going on. From
this day onward, that will be the tradition and the law of science
among wizards. Are we agreed on that?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Draco. Actually this <em>was</em> starting to sound
pretty attractive. The Death Eaters had tried to take power by
being scarier than everyone else, and they hadn't actually won yet.
Maybe it was time to try ruling using secrets instead. "And our
group stays hidden for as long as possible, and everyone in it has
to agree to our rules."</p>
<p>"Of course. Definitely."</p>
<p>There was a very short pause.</p>
<p>"We're going to need better robes," said the shadowy figure,
"with hoods and so on -"</p>
<p>"I was <em>just thinking</em> that," said Draco. "We don't need
whole new robes, though, just cowled cloaks to put on. I have a
friend in Slytherin, she'll take your measurements -"</p>
<p>"Don't tell her what it's <em>for</em>, though -"</p>
<p>"I'm not <em>stupid!</em> "</p>
<p>"And no masks for now, not when it's just you and me -" said the
shadowy figure.</p>
<p>"Right! But later on we should have some sort of special mark
that all our servants have, the Mark of Science, like a snake
eating the Moon on their right arms -"</p>
<p>"It's called a PhD and wouldn't that make it too easy to
identify our people?"</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"I mean, what if someone is like 'okay, now everyone pull up
their robes over their right arms' and our guy is like 'whoops,
sorry, looks like I'm a spy' -"</p>
<p><em>"Forget I said anything,</em>" said Draco, sweat suddenly
springing out all over his body. He needed a distraction,
<em>fast</em> - "And what do we call ourselves? The Science
Eaters?"</p>
<p>"No," said the shadowy figure slowly. "That doesn't sound
right..."</p>
<p>Draco wiped his robed arm across his forehead, wiping away beads
of moisture. What had the Dark Lord been <em>thinking?</em> Father
had said the Dark Lord was <em>smart!</em></p>
<p>"I've got it!" said the shadowy figure suddenly. "You won't
understand yet, but trust me, it fits."</p>
<p>Right now Draco would have accepted 'Malfoy Munchers' as long as
it changed the subject. "What is it?"</p>
<p>And standing amid the dusty desks in an unused classroom in the
dungeons of Hogwarts, the green-lit silhouette of Harry Potter
spread his arms dramatically and said, "This day shall mark the
dawn of... the <em>Bayesian Conspiracy</em>."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>A silent figure trudged wearily through the halls of Hogwarts in
the direction of Ravenclaw.</p>
<p>Harry had gone straight from the meeting with Draco to dinner,
and stayed at dinner barely long enough to choke down a few fast
gulps of food before going off to bed.</p>
<p>It wasn't even 7pm yet, but it was well past bedtime for Harry.
He'd realized <em>last</em> night that he wouldn't be able to use
the Time-Turner on Saturday until after the book-reading contest
was already over. But he could still use the Time-Turner on
<em>Friday</em> night, and gain time that way. So Harry had pushed
himself to stay awake until 9pm on Friday, when the protective
shell opened, and then used the four hours remaining on the
Time-Turner to spin back to 5pm and collapse into sleep. He'd woken
up around 2am on Saturday morning, just as planned, and read for
the next twelve hours straight... and it still hadn't been enough.
And now Harry would be going to sleep rather early for the next few
days, until his sleep cycle caught up again.</p>
<p>The portrait on the door asked Harry some dumb riddle meant for
eleven-year-olds that he answered without the words even passing
through his conscious mind, and then Harry staggered up the stairs
to his dorm room, changed into his pajamas and collapsed into
bed.</p>
<p>And found that his pillow seemed rather lumpy.</p>
<p>Harry groaned. He sat up reluctantly, twisted in bed, and lifted
up his pillow.</p>
<p>This revealed a note, two golden Galleons, and a book titled
<em>Occlumency: The Hidden Arte.</em></p>
<p>Harry picked up the note and read:</p>
<p><em>My, you do get yourself into trouble and quickly. Your
father was no match for you.</em></p>
<p><em>You have made a powerful enemy. Snape commands the loyalty,
admiration, and fear of all House Slytherin. You cannot trust any
of that House now, whether they come to you in friendly guise or
fearsome.</em></p>
<p><em>From now on you must not meet Snape's eyes. He is a
Legilimens and can read your mind if you do. I have enclosed a book
which may help you learn to protect yourself, though there is only
so far you can get without a tutor. Still you may hope to at least
detect intrusion.</em></p>
<p><em>So that you may find some extra time in which to study
Occlumency, I have enclosed 2 Galleons, which is the price of
answer sheets and homework for the first-year History of Magic
class (Professor Binns having given the same tests and same
assignments every year since he died). Your newfound friends the
Weasley twins should be able to sell you a copy. It goes without
saying that you must not get caught with it in your
possession.</em></p>
<p><em>Of Professor Quirrell I know little. He is a Slytherin and a
Defense Professor, and that is two marks against him. Consider
carefully any advice he gives you, and tell him nothing you do not
wish known.</em></p>
<p><em>Dumbledore only pretends to be insane. He is extremely
intelligent, and if you continue to step into closets and vanish,
he will certainly deduce your possession of an invisibility cloak
if he has not done so already. Avoid him whenever possible, hide
the Cloak of Invisibility somewhere safe (NOT your pouch) any time
you cannot avoid him, and step with great care in his
presence.</em></p>
<p><em>Please be more careful in the future, Harry Potter.</em></p>
<p><em>- Santa Claus</em></p>
<p>Harry stared at the note.</p>
<p>It <em>did</em> seem to be pretty good advice. Of course Harry
wasn't going to cheat in History class even if they gave him a dead
monkey for a professor. But Severus's Legilimency... whoever'd sent
this note knew a lot of important, secret things and was willing to
tell Harry about them. The note was still warning him against
Dumbledore stealing the Cloak but at this point Harry honestly had
no clue if that was a bad sign, it could just be an understandable
mistake.</p>
<p>There seemed to be some sort of intrigue going on inside
Hogwarts. Maybe if Harry <em>compared stories</em> between
Dumbledore and the note-sender, he could work out a
<em>combined</em> picture that would be accurate? Like if they
<em>both</em> agreed on something, then...</p>
<p>...whatever...</p>
<p>Harry stuffed everything into his pouch and turned up the
Quieter and pulled the cover over his head and died.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>It was Sunday morning and Harry was eating pancakes in the Great
Hall, sharp quick bites, glancing nervously at his watch every few
seconds.</p>
<p>It was 8:02am, and in precisely two hours and one minute, it
would be <em>exactly one week</em> since he'd seen the Weasleys and
crossed over onto Platform Nine and Three-Quarters.</p>
<p>And the thought had occurred to him... Harry didn't know if this
was a valid way to think about the universe, he didn't know
anything any more, but it <em>seemed possible...</em></p>
<p>That...</p>
<p><em>Not enough interesting things had happened to him over the
last week.</em></p>
<p>When he was done eating breakfast, Harry planned to go straight
up to his room and hide in the bottom level of his trunk and not
talk to anyone until 10:03am.</p>
<p>And that was when Harry saw the Weasley twins walking toward
him. One of them was carrying something concealed behind his
back.</p>
<p>He should scream and run away.</p>
<p>He should scream and run away.</p>
<p>Whatever this was... it could very well be...</p>
<p>...the <em>grand finale...</em></p>
<p>He really should just scream and run away.</p>
<p>With a resigned feeling that the universe would come and get him
<em>anyway</em>, Harry continued slicing at the pancake with his
fork and knife. He couldn't muster the energy. That was the sad
truth. Harry knew now how people felt when they were tired of
running, tired of trying to escape fate, and they just fell to the
ground and let the horrifically befanged and tentacled demons of
the darkest abyss drag them off to their unspeakable destiny.</p>
<p>The Weasley twins drew closer.</p>
<p>And yet closer.</p>
<p>Harry ate another bite of pancake.</p>
<p>The Weasley twins arrived, grinning brightly.</p>
<p>"Hello, Fred," Harry said dully. One of the twins nodded.
"Hello, George." The other twin nodded.</p>
<p>"You sound tired," said George.</p>
<p>"You should cheer up," said Fred.</p>
<p>"Look what <em>we</em> got you!"</p>
<p>And George took, from behind Fred's back -</p>
<p>A cake with twelve flaming candles.</p>
<p>There was a pause, as the Ravenclaw table stared at them.</p>
<p>"That's not right," said someone. "Harry Potter was born on the
thirty-first of Jul-"</p>
<p>"<em>HE IS COMING</em>," said a huge hollow voice that cut
through all conversation like a sword of ice. "<em>THE ONE WHO WILL
TEAR APART THE VERY -</em>"</p>
<p>Dumbledore had leapt out of his throne and run straight over the
Head Table and seized hold of the woman speaking those awful words,
Fawkes had appeared in a flash, and all three of them vanished in a
crack of fire.</p>
<p>There was a shocked pause...</p>
<p>...followed by heads turning in the direction of Harry
Potter.</p>
<p>"I didn't do it," Harry said in a tired voice.</p>
<p>"That was a <em>prophecy!</em> " someone at the table hissed.
"And I bet it's about <em>you!</em> "</p>
<p>Harry sighed.</p>
<p>He stood up from his seat, raised his voice, and said very
loudly over the conversations that were starting up, "<em>It's not
about me! Obviously! I'm not coming here, I'm already
here!</em> "</p>
<p>Harry sat back down again.</p>
<p>The people who had been looking at him turned away again.</p>
<p>Someone else at the table said, "Then who <em>is</em> it
about?"</p>
<p>And with a dull, leaden sensation, Harry realized who
<em>wasn't</em> already at Hogwarts.</p>
<p>Call it a wild guess, but Harry had a feeling the undead Dark
Lord would be showing up one of these days.</p>
<p>The conversation continued on around him.</p>
<p>"Not to mention, tear apart the very <em>what?</em> "</p>
<p>"I thought I heard Trelawney start to say something with an 'S'
just before the Headmaster grabbed her."</p>
<p>"Like... soul? Sun?"</p>
<p>"If someone's going to tear apart the Sun we're <em>really</em>
in trouble!"</p>
<p>That seemed rather unlikely to Harry, unless the world contained
scary things which had heard of David Criswell's ideas about star
lifting.</p>
<p>"So," Harry said in tired tones, "this happens every Sunday
breakfast, does it?"</p>
<p>"No," said a student who might have been in his seventh year,
frowning grimly. "It doesn't."</p>
<p>Harry shrugged. "Whatever. Anyone want some birthday cake?"</p>
<p>"But it's <em>not</em> your birthday!" said the same student
who'd objected last time.</p>
<p>That was the cue for Fred and George to start laughing, of
course.</p>
<p>Even Harry managed a weary smile.</p>
<p>As the first slice was served to him, Harry said, "I've had a
<em>really long week</em>."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>And Harry was sitting in the cavern level of his trunk, slid
shut and locked so no one could get in, a blanket pulled over his
head, waiting for the week to be over.</p>
<p>10:01.</p>
<p>10:02.</p>
<p>10:03, but just to be sure...</p>
<p>10:04 and the first week was done.</p>
<p>Harry breathed a sigh of relief, and gingerly pulled the blanket
off of his head.</p>
<p>A few moments later, he had emerged into the bright sunlit air
of his dorm.</p>
<p>Shortly after, and he was in the Ravenclaw common room. A few
people looked at him, but no one said anything or tried to talk to
him.</p>
<p>Harry found a nice wide writing desk, pulled back a comfortable
chair, and sat down. From his pouch he drew a sheet of paper and a
pencil.</p>
<p>Mum and Dad had told Harry in no uncertain terms that while they
understood his enthusiasm for leaving home and getting away from
his parents, he was to write them <em>every week without fail</em>,
just so that they knew he was alive, unharmed, and not in
prison.</p>
<p>Harry stared down at the blank sheet of paper. <em>Let's
see...</em></p>
<p>After leaving his parents at the train station, he'd...</p>
<p>...gotten acquainted with a boy raised by Darth Vader, become
friends with the three most infamous pranksters in Hogwarts, met
Hermione, then there'd been the Incident with the Sorting Hat...
Monday he'd been given a time machine to treat his sleep disorder,
gotten a legendary invisibility cloak from an unknown benefactor,
rescued seven Hufflepuffs by staring down five scary older boys one
of whom had threatened to break his finger, realized that he
possessed a mysterious dark side, learned to cast
<em>Frigideiro</em> in Charms class, and gotten started on his
rivalry with Hermione... Tuesday had introduced Astronomy taught by
Professor Aurora Sinistra who was nice, and History of Magic taught
by a ghost who ought to be exorcised and replaced with a tape
recorder... Wednesday, he'd been pronounced the Most Dangerous
Student in the Classroom... Thursday, let's not even think about
Thursday... Friday, the Incident in Potions Class, followed by his
blackmailing the Headmaster, followed by the Defense Professor
having him beaten up in class, followed by the Defense Professor
turning out to be the most awesome human being who still walked the
face of the Earth... Saturday he'd lost a bet and gone on his first
date and started redeeming Draco... and then this morning Professor
Trelawney's unheard prophecy might or might not indicate that an
immortal Dark Lord was about to attack Hogwarts.</p>
<p>Harry mentally organized his material, and started writing.</p>
<p><em>Dear Mum and Dad:</em></p>
<p><em>Hogwarts is lots of fun. I learned how to violate the Second
Law of Thermodynamics in Charms class, and I met a girl named
Hermione Granger who reads faster than I do.</em></p>
<p><em>I'd better leave it at that.</em></p>
<p><em>Your loving son,<br>
Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres.</em></p>

<p><em>Act 3:</em></p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Draco waited in a small windowed alcove he'd found near the
Great Hall, stomach churning.</p>
<p>There would be a price, and it would not be small. Draco had
known that as soon as he'd woken up and realized that he didn't
dare enter the Great Hall for breakfast because he might see Harry
Potter there and Draco didn't know what would happen after
that.</p>
<p>Footsteps approached.</p>
<p>"Here ya go," said Vincent's voice. "Now da boss ain't in a good
mood today, so ya'd better watch your step."</p>
<p>Draco was going to skin that idiot alive and send back the
flayed body with a request for a more intelligent servant, like a
dead gerbil.</p>
<p>One set of footsteps went off, and the other set of footsteps
came closer.</p>
<p>The churning in Draco's stomach got worse.</p>
<p>Harry Potter came into sight. His face was carefully neutral,
but his blue-trimmed robes looked oddly askew, as if they hadn't
been put on quite right -</p>
<p>"<em>Your hand,</em>" Draco said without thinking about it at
all.</p>
<p>Harry raised his left arm, as though to look at it himself.</p>
<p>The hand dangled limply from it, like something dead.</p>
<p>"Madam Pomfrey said it's not permanent," Harry said quietly.
"She said it should mostly recover by the time classes start
tomorrow."</p>
<p>For a single instant the news came as a relief.</p>
<p>And then Draco realized.</p>
<p>"You went to Madam Pomfrey," whispered Draco.</p>
<p>"Of course I did," said Harry Potter, as though stating the
obvious. "My hand wasn't working."</p>
<p>It was slowly dawning on Draco what an <em>absolute</em> fool
he'd been, far worse than the older Slytherins he'd chewed out.</p>
<p>He'd just taken for granted that no one would go to the
authorities when a Malfoy did something to them. That no one would
want Lucius Malfoy's eye on them, ever.</p>
<p>But Harry Potter wasn't a frightened little Hufflepuff trying to
stay out of the game. He was already playing it, and Father's eye
was already on him.</p>
<p>"What else did Madam Pomfrey say?" said Draco, his heart in his
throat.</p>
<p>"Professor Flitwick said that the spell cast on my hand had been
a Dark torture hex and extremely serious business, and that
refusing to say who did it was absolutely unacceptable."</p>
<p>There was a long pause.</p>
<p>"And then?" Draco said in a shaking voice.</p>
<p>Harry Potter smiled slightly. "I apologized deeply, which made
Professor Flitwick look <em>very</em> stern, and then I told
Professor Flitwick that the whole thing was, indeed, extremely
serious, secret, <em>delicate</em> business, and that I'd already
informed the Headmaster about the project."</p>
<p>Draco gasped. "No! Flitwick isn't going to just accept that!
He'll check with Dumbledore!"</p>
<p>"Indeed," said Harry Potter. "I was promptly hauled off to the
Headmaster's office."</p>
<p>Draco was trembling now. If Dumbledore brought Harry Potter
before the Wizengamot, willingly or otherwise, and had the
Boy-Who-Lived testify under Veritaserum that Draco had tortured
him... too many people loved Harry Potter, Father could
<em>lose</em> that vote...</p>
<p>Father might be able to convince Dumbledore not to do that, but
it would <em>cost.</em> Cost terribly. The game had rules now, you
couldn't just threaten someone at random any more. But Draco had
walked into Dumbledore's hands of his own free will. And Draco was
a very valuable hostage.</p>
<p>Though since Draco couldn't be a Death Eater now, he wasn't as
valuable as Father thought.</p>
<p>The thought tore at his heart like a Cutting Charm.</p>
<p>"Then what?" whispered Draco.</p>
<p>"Dumbledore deduced immediately that it was you. He knew we'd
been associating."</p>
<p>The worst possible scenario. If Dumbledore hadn't guessed who
did it, he might not have risked using Legilimency just to find
out... but if Dumbledore <em>knew...</em></p>
<p>"And?" Draco forced out the word.</p>
<p>"We had a little chat."</p>
<p>"And?"</p>
<p>Harry Potter grinned. "And I explained that it would be in his
best interest not to do anything."</p>
<p>Draco's mind ran into a brick wall and splattered. He just
stared at Harry Potter with his mouth hanging slack like a
fool.</p>
<p>It took that long for Draco to remember.</p>
<p>Harry knew Dumbledore's mysterious secret, the one Snape used as
his hold.</p>
<p>Draco could just see it now. Dumbledore looking all stern,
concealing his eagerness as he explained to Harry what a terribly
serious matter this was.</p>
<p>And Harry politely telling Dumbledore to keep his mouth shut if
he knew what was good for him.</p>
<p>Father had warned Draco against people like this, people who
could ruin you and still be so likable that it was hard to hate
them properly.</p>
<p>"After which," Harry said, "the Headmaster told Professor
Flitwick that this was, indeed, a secret and delicate matter of
which he had already been informed, and that he did not think
pressing it at this time would help me or anyone. Professor
Flitwick started to say something about the Headmaster's usual
plotting going much too far, and I had to interrupt at that point
and explain that it had been my <em>own</em> idea and not anything
the Headmaster forced me into, so Professor Flitwick spun around
and started lecturing <em>me</em>, and the Headmaster interrupted
<em>him</em> and said that as the Boy-Who-Lived I was doomed to
have weird and dangerous adventures so I was safer if I got into
them on purpose instead of waiting for them to happen by accident,
and that was when Professor Flitwick threw up his little hands and
started shrieking in a high-pitched voice at <em>both</em> of us
about how he didn't care what we were cooking up together, but this
wasn't ever to happen again for as long as I was in Ravenclaw House
or he would have me thrown out and I could go to Gryffindor which
was where all this <em>Dumbledoring</em> belonged -"</p>
<p>Harry was making it <em>very</em> hard for Draco to hate
him.</p>
<p>"Anyway," Harry said, "I didn't want to be thrown out of
Ravenclaw, so I promised Professor Flitwick that nothing like this
would happen again, and if it did, I would just tell him who did
it."</p>
<p>Harry's eyes should have been cold. They weren't. The voice
should have made it a deadly threat. It wasn't.</p>
<p>And Draco saw the question that should have been obvious, and it
killed the mood in an instant.</p>
<p>"Why... didn't you?"</p>
<p>Harry walked over to the window, into the small beam of sunlight
shining into the alcove, and turned his head outward, toward the
green grounds of Hogwarts. The brightness shone on him, on his
robes, on his face.</p>
<p>"Why didn't I?" Harry said. His voice caught. "I guess because I
just couldn't get angry at you. I knew I'd hurt you first. I won't
even call it fair, because what I did to you was worse than what
you did to me."</p>
<p>It was like running into another brick wall. Harry could have
been speaking archaic Greek for all Draco understood him then.</p>
<p>Draco's mind scrabbled for patterns and came up flat blank. The
statement was a concession that hadn't been in Harry's best
interests. It wasn't even what Harry should say to make Draco a
more loyal servant, now that Harry held power over him. For that
Harry should be emphasizing how kindly he'd been, not how much he'd
hurt Draco.</p>
<p>"Even so," Harry said, and now his voice was lower, almost a
whisper, "please don't do that again, Draco. It hurt, and I'm not
sure I could forgive you a second time. I'm not sure I'd be able to
want to."</p>
<p>Draco just didn't get it.</p>
<p>Was Harry trying to be <em>friends</em> with him?</p>
<p>There was no way Harry Potter could be dumb enough to believe
that was still possible after what he'd done.</p>
<p>You could be someone's friend and ally, like Draco had tried to
do with Harry, or you could destroy their life and leave them no
other options. Not both.</p>
<p>But then Draco didn't understand what else Harry <em>could</em>
be trying.</p>
<p>And a strange thought came to Draco then, something Harry had
kept talking about yesterday.</p>
<p>And the thought was: <em>Test it.</em></p>
<p><em>You're awakened as a scientist now,</em> Harry had said,
<em>and even if you never learn to use your power, you'll always,
be looking, for ways, to test, your beliefs...</em> Those ominous
words, spoken in gasps of agony, had kept running through Draco's
mind.</p>
<p>If Harry <em>was</em> pretending to be the repentant friend who
had accidentally hurt someone...</p>
<p>"You <em>planned</em> what you did to me!" Draco said, managing
to put a note of accusation in his voice. "You didn't do it because
you got angry, you did it because you <em>wanted</em> to!"</p>
<p><em>Fool,</em> Harry Potter would say, <em>of course I planned
it, and now you're mine -</em></p>
<p>Harry turned back toward Draco. "What happened yesterday
<em>wasn't</em> the plan," Harry said, his voice seeming stuck in
his throat. "The <em>plan</em> was that I would teach you why you
were always better off knowing the truth, and then we would try
together to discover the truth about blood, and whatever the answer
was we would accept it. Yesterday I... rushed things."</p>
<p>"Always better off knowing the truth," Draco said coldly. "Like
you did me a <em>favor.</em>"</p>
<p>Harry nodded, blowing Draco's mind completely, and said, "What
if Lucius comes up with the same idea I did, that the problem is
stronger wizards having fewer children? He might start a program to
pay the strongest purebloods to have more children. In fact, if
blood purism <em>were</em> right, that's just what Lucius
<em>should</em> be doing - addressing the problem on <em>his</em>
side, where he can make things happen right away. Right now, Draco,
you're the only friend Lucius has who would try to stop him from
wasting the effort, because you're the only one who knows the
<em>real</em> truth and can predict the real results."</p>
<p>The thought came to Draco that Harry Potter had been raised in a
place so strange that he was now effectively a magical creature
rather than a wizard. Draco simply couldn't guess what Harry would
say or do next.</p>
<p>"<em>Why?</em> " Draco said. Putting pain and betrayal into his
voice wasn't hard at all. "Why did you <em>do</em> this to me? What
<em>was</em> your plan?"</p>
<p>"Well," Harry said, "you're Lucius's heir, and believe it or
not, Dumbledore thinks I belong to him. So we could grow up and
fight their battles with each other. Or we could do something
else."</p>
<p>Slowly, Draco's mind wrapped around this. "You want to provoke a
fight to the finish between them, then seize power after they're
both exhausted." Draco felt cold dread in his chest. He would
<em>have</em> to try and stop that no matter the cost to himself
-</p>
<p>But Harry shook his head. "Stars above, <em>no!</em> "</p>
<p>"No...?"</p>
<p>"You wouldn't go along with that and neither would I," said
Harry. "This is <em>our</em> world, we don't want to break it. But
imagine, say, Lucius thought the Conspiracy was your tool and you
were on his side, Dumbledore thought the Conspiracy was my tool and
I was on his side, Lucius thought that you'd turned me and
Dumbledore believed the Conspiracy was mine, Dumbledore thought
that I'd turned you and Lucius believed the Conspiracy was yours,
and so they both helped us out but only in ways that the other one
wouldn't notice."</p>
<p>Draco did not have to fake being speechless.</p>
<p>Father had once taken him to see a play called <em>The Tragedy
of Light</em>, about this <em>incredibly</em> clever Slytherin
named Light who'd set out to purify the world of evil using an
ancient ring that could kill anyone whose name and face he knew,
and who'd been opposed by another incredibly clever Slytherin, a
villain named Lawliet, who'd worn a disguise to conceal his true
face; and Draco had shouted and cheered at all the right parts,
especially in the middle; and then the play had ended sadly and
Draco had been hugely disappointed and Father had gently pointed
out that the word 'Tragedy' was right there in the title.</p>
<p>Afterward, Father had asked Draco if he understood why they had
gone to see this play.</p>
<p>Draco had said it was to teach him to be as cunning as Light and
Lawliet when he grew up.</p>
<p>Father had said that Draco couldn't possibly be more wrong, and
pointed out that while Lawliet had cleverly concealed his face
there had been no good reason for him to tell Light his
<em>name</em>. Father had then gone on to demolish almost every
part of the play, while Draco listened with his eyes growing wider
and wider. And Father had finished by saying that plays like this
were <em>always</em> unrealistic, because if the playwright had
known what someone <em>actually</em> as smart as Light would
<em>actually</em> do, the playwright would have tried to take over
the world himself instead of just writing plays about it.</p>
<p>That was when Father had told Draco about the Rule of Three,
which was that any plot which required more than three different
things to happen would never work in real life.</p>
<p>Father had <em>further</em> explained that since only a fool
would attempt a plot that was <em>as complicated as possible</em>,
the real limit was two.</p>
<p>Draco couldn't even find words to describe the sheer gargantuan
unworkability of Harry's master plan.</p>
<p>But it was <em>just</em> the sort of mistake you would make if
you didn't have any mentors and thought you were clever and had
learned about plotting by watching plays.</p>
<p>"So," said Harry, "what do you think of the plan?"</p>
<p>"It's clever..." Draco said slowly. Shouting <em>brilliant!</em>
and gasping in awe would have looked too suspicious. "Harry, can I
ask a question?"</p>
<p>"Sure," said Harry.</p>
<p>"Why did you buy Granger an expensive pouch?"</p>
<p>"To show no hard feelings," said Harry at once. "Though I expect
she'll also feel awkward if she refuses any small requests I make
over the next couple of months."</p>
<p>And that was when Draco realized that Harry actually
<em>was</em> trying to be his friend.</p>
<p>Harry's move against Granger <em>had</em> been smart, maybe even
brilliant. Make your enemy not suspect you, <em>and</em> put them
into your debt in a friendly way so that you could maneuver them
into position <em>just by asking them</em>. Draco couldn't have
gotten away with that, his target would have been too suspicious,
but the Boy-Who-Lived <em>could.</em> So the first step of Harry's
plot was to give his enemy an expensive present, Draco wouldn't
have thought of that, but it could
<em>work...</em><em><br></em></p>
<p>If you were Harry's enemy, his plots might be hard to see
through at first, they might even be stupid, but his reasoning
would make <em>sense</em> once you understood it, you would
comprehend that he was trying to hurt you.</p>
<p>The way Harry was acting toward Draco right now did <em>not</em>
make sense.</p>
<p>Because if you were Harry's <em>friend,</em> then he tried to be
friends with you in the alien, incomprehensible way he'd been
raised by Muggles to do, even if it meant destroying your entire
life.</p>
<p>The silence stretched.</p>
<p>"I know that I've abused our friendship terribly," Harry said
finally. "But please realize, Draco, that in the end, I just wanted
the two of us to find the truth together. Is that something you can
forgive?"</p>
<p>A fork with two paths, but with only one path easy to go back on
later if Draco changed his mind...</p>
<p>"I guess I understand what you were trying to do," Draco lied,
"so yes."</p>
<p>Harry's eyes lit up. "I'm glad to hear that, Draco," he said
softly.</p>
<p>The two students stood in that alcove, Harry still dipped in the
lone sunbeam, Draco in shadow.</p>
<p>And Draco realized with a note of horror and despair, that
although it was a terrifying fate indeed to be Harry's friend,
Harry now had so many different avenues for threatening Draco that
being his enemy would be even <em>worse</em>.</p>
<p>Probably.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>Well, he could always switch to being enemies later...</p>
<p>He was doomed.</p>
<p>"So," Draco said. "Now what?"</p>
<p>"We study again next Saturday?"</p>
<p>"It better not go like the last one -"</p>
<p>"Don't worry, it won't," said Harry. "A few more Saturdays like
<em>that</em> and you'd be ahead of <em>me.</em>"</p>
<p>Harry laughed. Draco didn't.</p>
<p>"Oh, and before you go," Harry said, and grinned sheepishly. "I
know this is a bad time, but I wanted to ask you for advice about
something, actually."</p>
<p>"Okay," Draco said, still a bit distracted by that last
statement.</p>
<p>Harry's eyes grew intent. "Buying that pouch for Granger used up
most of the gold I managed to steal from my Gringotts vault -"</p>
<p>What.</p>
<p>"- and McGonagall has the vault key, or Dumbledore does now,
maybe. And I was just about to launch a plot that might take some
money, so I was wondering if you know how I can get access -"</p>
<p>"I'll loan you the money," said Draco's mouth in sheer
existential reflex.</p>
<p>Harry looked taken aback, but in a pleased way. "Draco, you
don't have to -"</p>
<p>"How much?"</p>
<p>Harry named the amount and Draco couldn't quite keep the shock
from showing on his face. That was almost all the spending money
Father had given Draco to last out the whole year, Draco would be
left with just a few Galleons -</p>
<p>Then Draco mentally kicked himself. All he had to do was write
Father and explain that the money was gone because he had managed
to <em>loan it to Harry Potter,</em> and Father would send him a
special congratulatory note written in golden ink, a giant
Chocolate Frog that would take two weeks to eat, and ten times as
many Galleons just in case Harry Potter needed another loan.</p>
<p>"It's way too much, isn't it," said Harry. "I'm sorry, I
shouldn't have asked -"</p>
<p>"Excuse me, I <em>am</em> a Malfoy, you know," said Draco. "I
was just surprised you <em>wanted</em> that much."</p>
<p>"Don't worry," Harry Potter said cheerfully. "It's nothing that
threatens your family's interests, just me being evil."</p>
<p>Draco nodded. "No problem, then. You want to go get it right
now?"</p>
<p>"Sure," said Harry.</p>
<p>As they left the alcove and started heading toward the dungeons,
Draco couldn't help but ask, "So <em>can</em> you tell me which
plot this is for?"</p>
<p>"Rita Skeeter."</p>
<p>Draco thought some very bad words to himself, but it was far too
late to say no.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>By the time they'd reached the dungeons, Draco had started
pulling together his thoughts again.</p>
<p>He <em>was</em> having trouble hating Harry Potter. Harry
<em>had</em> been trying to be friendly, he was just insane.</p>
<p>And that wasn't going to stop Draco's revenge or even slow it
down.</p>
<p>"So," Draco said, after looking around to make certain no one
was nearby. Their voices would both be Blurred, of course, but it
never hurt to be extra sure. "I've been thinking. When we bring new
recruits into the Conspiracy, they're going to have to
<em>think</em> we're equals. Otherwise it would only take
<em>one</em> of them to blow the plot to Father. You already worked
that out, right?"</p>
<p>"Naturally," said Harry.</p>
<p>"<em>Will</em> we be equals?" said Draco.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid not," Harry said. It was clear that he was trying to
sound gentle, and also clear that he was trying to suppress a good
deal of condescension and not quite succeeding. "I'm sorry, Draco,
but you don't even know what the word <em>Bayesian</em> in
<em>Bayesian Conspiracy</em> means right now. You're going to have
to study for months before we take anyone else in, just so you can
put up a <em>good front</em>."</p>
<p>"Because I don't know enough science," Draco said, carefully
keeping his voice neutral.</p>
<p>Harry shook his head at that. "The problem isn't that you're
ignorant of specific science things like deoxyribonucleic acid.
<em>That</em> wouldn't stop you from being my equal. The problem is
that you aren't trained in the methods of rationality, the
<em>deeper</em> secret knowledge behind how all those discoveries
got made in the first place. I'll <em>try</em> to teach you those,
but they're a lot harder to learn. Think of what we did yesterday,
Draco. Yes, you did some of the work. But I was the only one in
control. You answered some of the questions. I asked all of them.
You helped push. I did the steering by myself. And without the
methods of rationality, Draco, you can't possibly steer the
Conspiracy where it needs to go."</p>
<p>"I see," said Draco, his voice sounding disappointed.</p>
<p>Harry's voice tried to gentle itself even more. "I'll try to
respect your expertise, Draco, about things like people stuff. But
you need to respect my expertise too, and there's just no
<em>way</em> you could be my equal when it comes to steering the
Conspiracy. You've only been a scientist for <em>one day</em>, you
know <em>one</em> secret about deoxyribonucleic acid, and you
aren't trained in <em>any</em> of the methods of rationality."</p>
<p>"I understand," said Draco.</p>
<p>And he did.</p>
<p><em>People stuff,</em> Harry had said. Seizing control of the
Conspiracy probably wouldn't even be difficult. And afterward, he
would kill Harry Potter just to be sure -</p>
<p>The memory rose up in Draco of how sick inside it had felt last
night, knowing Harry was screaming.</p>
<p>Draco thought some more bad words.</p>
<p>Fine. He <em>wouldn't</em> kill Harry. Harry had been raised by
Muggles, it wasn't his fault he was insane.</p>
<p>Instead, Harry would live on, just so that Draco could tell him
that it had all been for Harry's own good, really, he ought to be
grateful -</p>
<p>And with a sudden twitch of surprised pleasure, Draco realized
that it actually <em>was</em> for Harry's own good. If Harry tried
to carry out his plan of playing Dumbledore and Father for fools,
he would <em>die.</em></p>
<p>That made it <em>perfect.</em></p>
<p>Draco would take all of Harry's dreams away from him, just as
Harry had done to him.</p>
<p>Draco would tell Harry that it had been for his own good, and it
would be absolutely true.</p>
<p>Draco would wield the Conspiracy and the power of science to
purify the wizarding world, and Father would be as proud of him as
if he'd been a Death Eater.</p>
<p>Harry Potter's evil plots would be foiled, and the forces of
right would prevail.</p>
<p>The perfect revenge.</p>
<p>Unless...</p>
<p><em>Just pretend to be pretending to be a scientist,</em> Harry
had told him.</p>
<p>Draco didn't have words to describe exactly what was wrong with
Harry's mind -</p>
<p>(since Draco had never heard the term <em>depth of
recursion</em>)</p>
<p>- but he could guess what sort of plots it implied.</p>
<p>...unless all that was exactly what Harry <em>wanted</em> Draco
to do as part of some even <em>larger</em> plot which Draco would
play <em>right into</em> by trying to foil this one, Harry might
even <em>know</em> that his plan was unworkable, it might have no
purpose <em>except</em> luring Draco to thwart it -</p>
<p>No. That way lay <em>madness.</em> There <em>had</em> to be a
limit. The Dark Lord himself hadn't been <em>that</em> twisty. That
sort of thing didn't happen in real life, only in Father's silly
bedtime stories about foolish gargoyles who always ended up
furthering the hero's plans every time they tried to stop him.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>And beside Draco, Harry walked along with a smile on his face,
thinking about the evolutionary origins of human intelligence.</p>
<p>In the beginning, before people had quite understood how
evolution worked, they'd gone around thinking crazy ideas like
<em>human intelligence evolved so that we could invent better
tools.</em></p>
<p>The reason why this was crazy was that only one person in the
tribe had to invent a tool, and then everyone else would use it,
and it would spread to other tribes, and still be used by their
descendants a hundred years later. That was great from the
perspective of scientific progress, but in evolutionary terms, it
meant that the person who invented something didn't have much of a
fitness <em>advantage</em>, didn't have all that many <em>more</em>
children than everyone else. Only <em>relative</em> fitness
advantages could increase the relative frequency of a gene in the
population, and drive some lonely mutation to the point where it
was universal and everyone had it. And brilliant inventions just
weren't common enough to provide the sort of consistent selection
pressure it took to promote a mutation. It was a natural guess, if
you looked at humans with their guns and tanks and nuclear weapons
and compared them to chimpanzees, that the intelligence was there
to make the technology. A natural guess, but wrong.</p>
<p>Before people had quite understood how evolution worked, they'd
gone around thinking crazy ideas like <em>the climate changed, and
tribes had to migrate, and people had to become smarter in order to
solve all the novel problems.</em></p>
<p>But human beings had four times the brain size of a chimpanzee.
20% of a human's metabolic energy went into feeding the brain.
Humans were <em>ridiculously</em> smarter than any other species.
That sort of thing didn't happen because the environment stepped up
the difficulty of its problems a little. Then the organisms would
just get a little smarter to solve them. Ending up with that
gigantic outsized brain must have taken some sort of
<em>runaway</em> evolutionary process, something that would push
and push without limits.</p>
<p>And today's scientists had a pretty good guess at what that
runaway evolutionary process had been.</p>
<p>Harry had once read a famous book called <em>Chimpanzee
Politics.</em> The book had described how an adult chimpanzee named
Luit had confronted the aging alpha, Yeroen, with the help of a
young, recently matured chimpanzee named Nikkie. Nikkie had not
intervened directly in the fights between Luit and Yeroen, but had
prevented Yeroen's other supporters in the tribe from coming to his
aid, distracting them whenever a confrontation developed between
Luit and Yeroen. And in time Luit had won, and become the new
alpha, with Nikkie as the second most powerful...</p>
<p>...though it hadn't taken very long after that for Nikkie to
form an alliance with the defeated Yeroen, overthrow Luit, and
become the <em>new</em> new alpha.</p>
<p>It really made you appreciate what millions of years of hominids
trying to outwit <em>each other</em> - an evolutionary arms race
without limit - had led to in the way of increased mental
capacity.</p>
<p>'Cause, y'know, a human would have totally seen that one
coming.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>And beside Harry, Draco walked along, suppressing his smile as
he thought about his revenge.</p>
<p>Someday, maybe in years but someday, Harry Potter would learn
just what it meant to underestimate a Malfoy.</p>
<p>Draco had awakened as a scientist in a single day. Harry had
said that wasn't supposed to happen for months.</p>
<p>But of course if you were a Malfoy, you would be a more powerful
scientist than anyone who wasn't.</p>
<p>So Draco would learn all of Harry Potter's methods of
rationality, and then when the time was ripe -</p>

Solutions<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>To seek out new life, and J. K. Rowling!</p>
<p>Note: Since the science in this story is usually all correct, I
include a warning that in Ch. 22-25 Harry overlooks many
possibilities, the most important of which is that there are lots
of magical genes but they're all on one chromosome (which wouldn't
happen naturally, but the chromosome might have been engineered).
In this case, the inheritance pattern would be Mendelian, but the
magical chromosome could still be degraded by chromosomal crossover
with its nonmagical homologue. (Harry has read about Mendel and
chromosomes in science history books, but he hasn't studied enough
actual genetics to know about chromosomal crossover. Hey, he's only
eleven.) However, although a modern science journal would find a
<em>lot</em> more nits to pick, everything Harry presents as strong
evidence is in fact strong evidence - the other possibilities are
<em>improbable</em>.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Act 2:</em></p>
<p>(The sun shone brilliantly into the Great Hall from the
enchanted sky-ceiling above, illuminating the students as though
they sat beneath the naked sky, gleaming from their plates and
bowls, as, refreshed by a night's sleep, they inhaled breakfast in
preparation for whatever plans they'd made for their Sunday.)</p>
<p>So. There was only one thing that made you a wizard.</p>
<p>That wasn't surprising, when you thought about it. What DNA
mostly did was tell ribosomes how to chain amino acids together
into proteins. Conventional physics seemed quite capable of
describing amino acids, and no matter how many amino acids you
chained together, conventional physics said you would never, ever
get magic out of it.</p>
<p>And yet magic seemed to be hereditary, following DNA.</p>
<p>Then that probably <em>wasn't</em> because the DNA was chaining
together nonmagical amino acids into magical proteins.</p>
<p>Rather the key DNA sequence did not, of itself, give you your
magic at all.</p>
<p>Magic came from somewhere else.</p>
<p>(At the Ravenclaw table there was one boy who was staring off
into space, as his right hand automatically spooned some
unimportant food into his mouth from whatever was in front of him.
You probably could have substituted a pile of dirt and he wouldn't
have noticed.)</p>
<p>And for some reason the Source of Magic was paying attention to
a particular DNA marker among individuals who were ordinary
ape-descended humans in every other way.</p>
<p>(Actually there were quite a lot of boys and girls staring off
into space. It was the <em>Ravenclaw</em> table, after all.)</p>
<p>There were other lines of logic leading to the same conclusion.
<em>Complex</em> machinery was always universal within a sexually
reproducing species. If gene B relied on gene A, then A had to be
useful on its own, and rise to near-universality in the gene pool
on its own, before B would be useful often enough to confer a
fitness advantage. Then once B was universal you would get a
variant A* that relied on B, and then C that relied on A* and B,
then B* that relied on C, until the whole machine would fall apart
if you removed a single piece. But it all had to happen
<em>incrementally</em> - evolution never looked ahead, evolution
would never start promoting B in <em>preparation</em> for A
becoming universal later. Evolution was the simple historical fact
that, whichever organisms did in fact have the most children, their
genes would in fact be more frequent in the next generation. So
each piece of a complex machine had to become nearly universal
before other pieces in the machine would evolve to depend on its
presence.</p>
<p>So <em>complex, interdependent</em> machinery, the powerful
sophisticated protein machines that drove life, was always
<em>universal</em> within a sexually reproducing species - except
for a small handful of <em>non</em>-interdependent
<em>variants</em> that were being selected on at any given time, as
further complexity was slowly laid down. It was why all human
beings had the same underlying brain design, the same emotions, the
same facial expressions wired up to those emotions; those
adaptations were complex, so they <em>had</em> to be universal.</p>
<p>If magic had been like that, a big complex adaptation with lots
of necessary genes, then a wizard mating with a Muggle would have
resulted in a child with only half those parts and half the machine
wouldn't do much. And so there would have been no Muggleborns,
ever. Even if all the pieces had individually gotten into the
Muggle gene pool, they'd never reassemble all in one place to form
a wizard.</p>
<p>There hadn't been some genetically isolated valley of humans
that had stumbled onto an evolutionary pathway leading to
sophisticated magical sections of the brain. That complex genetic
machinery, if wizards interbred with Muggles, would never have
reassembled into Muggleborns.</p>
<p>So however your genes made you a wizard, it <em>wasn't</em> by
containing the blueprints for complicated machinery.</p>
<p>That was the other reason Harry had guessed the Mendelian
pattern would be there. If magical genes weren't complicated, why
would there be more than one?</p>
<p>And yet magic itself seemed pretty complicated. A door-locking
spell would prevent the door from opening <em>and</em> prevent you
from Transfiguring the hinges <em>and</em> resist <em>Finite
Incantatem</em> and <em>Alohomora</em>. Many elements all pointing
in the same direction: you could call that goal-orientation, or in
simpler language, purposefulness.</p>
<p>There were only two known causes of purposeful complexity.
Natural selection, which produced things like butterflies. And
intelligent engineering, which produced things like cars.</p>
<p>Magic didn't seem like something that had self-replicated into
existence. Spells were purposefully complicated, but not, like a
butterfly, complicated for the purpose of making copies of
themselves. Spells were complicated for the purpose of serving
their user, like a car.</p>
<p>Some intelligent engineer, then, had created the Source of
Magic, and told it to pay attention to a particular DNA marker.</p>
<p>The obvious next thought was that this had something to do with
"Atlantis".</p>
<p>Harry had asked Hermione about that earlier - on the train to
Hogwarts, after hearing Draco say it - and so far as she knew,
nothing more was known than the word itself.</p>
<p>It might have been pure legend. But it was also plausible enough
that a civilization of magic-users, especially one from
<em>before</em> the Interdict of Merlin, would have managed to blow
itself up.</p>
<p>The line of reasoning continued: Atlantis had been an isolated
civilization that had somehow brought into being the Source of
Magic, and told it to serve only people with the Atlantean genetic
marker, the blood of Atlantis.</p>
<p>And by similar logic: The words a wizard spoke, the wand
movements, those weren't complicated enough of themselves to build
up the spell effects from scratch - not the way that the three
billion base pairs of human DNA actually <em>were</em> complicated
enough to build a human body from scratch, not the way that
computer programs took up thousands of bytes of data.</p>
<p>So the words and wand movements were just triggers, levers
pulled on some hidden and more complex machine. Buttons, not
blueprints.</p>
<p>And just like a computer program wouldn't compile if you made a
single spelling error, the Source of Magic wouldn't respond to you
unless you cast your spells in exactly the right way.</p>
<p>The chain of logic was inexorable.</p>
<p>And it led inevitably toward a single final conclusion.</p>
<p>The ancient forebears of the wizards, thousands of years
earlier, had told the Source of Magic to only levitate things if
you said...</p>
<p>'Wingardium Leviosa.'</p>
<p>Harry slumped over at the breakfast table, resting his forehead
wearily on his right hand.</p>
<p>There was a story from the dawn days of Artificial Intelligence
- back when they were just starting out and no one had yet realized
the problem would be difficult - about a professor who had
delegated one of his grad students to solve the problem of computer
vision.</p>
<p>Harry was beginning to understand how that grad student must
have felt.</p>
<p>This could take a while.</p>
<p>Why did it take more effort to cast the Alohomora spell, if it
was just like pressing a button?</p>
<p>Who'd been silly enough to build in a spell for <em>Avada
Kedavra</em> that could only be cast using hatred?</p>
<p>Why did wordless Transfiguration require you to make a complete
mental separation between the concept of form and concept of
material?</p>
<p>Harry might not be done with this problem by the time he
graduated Hogwarts. He could still be working on this problem when
he was <em>thirty years old.</em> Hermione had been right, Harry
<em>hadn't</em> realized that on a gut level before. He'd just
given an inspiring speech about determination.</p>
<p>Harry's mind briefly considered whether to get on a gut level
that he might never solve the problem at all, then decided that
would be taking things much too far.</p>
<p>Besides, so long as he could get as far as immortality in the
first few decades, he'd be fine.</p>
<p>What method had the Dark Lord used? Come to think, the fact that
the Dark Lord had somehow managed to survive the death of his first
body was almost <em>infinitely</em> more important than the fact
that he'd tried to take over magical Britain -</p>
<p>"Excuse me," said an expected voice from behind him in very
unexpected tones. "At your convenience, Mr. Malfoy requests the
favor of a conversation."</p>
<p>Harry did not choke on his breakfast cereal. Instead he turned
around and beheld Mr. Crabbe.</p>
<p>"Excuse <em>me,</em>" said Harry. "Don't you mean 'Da boss wants
ta talk wid youse?'"</p>
<p>Mr. Crabbe didn't look happy. "Mr. Malfoy instructed me to speak
properly."</p>
<p>"I can't hear you," Harry said. "You're not speaking properly."
He turned back to his bowl of tiny blue crystal snowflakes and
deliberately ate another spoonful.</p>
<p>"Da boss wants to talk with youse," came a threatening voice
from behind him. "Ya'd better come see him if ya know what's good
for ya."</p>
<p>There. <em>Now</em> everything was going according to plan.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Act 1:</em></p>
<p>"A <em>reason?</em> " said the old wizard. He restrained the
fury from his face. The boy before him had been the victim, and
certainly did not need to be frightened any further. "There is
<em>nothing</em> that can excuse -"</p>
<p>"What I did to him was worse."</p>
<p>The old wizard stiffened in sudden horror. "Harry, <em>what have
you done?</em> "</p>
<p>"I tricked Draco into believing that I'd tricked him into
participating in a ritual that sacrificed his belief in blood
purism. And that meant he couldn't be a Death Eater when he grew
up. He'd lost everything, Headmaster."</p>
<p>There was a long quiet in the office, broken only by the tiny
puffs and whistles of the fiddly things, which after enough time
had come to seem like silence.</p>
<p>"Dear me," said the old wizard, "I <em>do</em> feel silly. And
<em>here</em> I was expecting you might try to redeem the heir of
Malfoy by, say, <em>showing him true friendship and
kindness</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>Ha!</em> Yeah, like <em>that</em> would have worked."</p>
<p>The old wizard sighed. This was taking it too far. "Tell me,
Harry. Did it even <em>occur</em> to you that there was something
<em>incongruous</em> about setting out to redeem someone through
lies and trickery?"</p>
<p>"I did it without telling any direct lies, and since we're
talking about Draco Malfoy here, I think the word you're looking
for is <em>congruous</em>." The boy looked rather smug.</p>
<p>The old wizard shook his head in despair. "And <em>this</em> is
the hero. We're all doomed."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Act 5:</em></p>
<p>The long, narrow tunnel of rough stone, unlit except by a
child's wand, seemed to stretch on for miles.</p>
<p>The reason for this was simple: It <em>did</em> stretch on for
miles.</p>
<p>The time was three in the morning, and Fred and George were
starting the long way down the secret passage that led from a
statue of a one-eyed witch in Hogwarts, to the cellar of the
Honeydukes candyshop in Hogsmeade.</p>
<p>"How's it doing?" said Fred in a low voice.</p>
<p>(Not that there'd be anyone listening, but there was something
odd about talking in a normal voice when you were going through a
secret passage.)</p>
<p>"Still on the fritz," said George.</p>
<p>"Both, or -"</p>
<p>"Intermittent one fixed itself again. Other one's same as
ever."</p>
<p>The Map was an extraordinarily powerful artifact, capable of
tracking every sentient being on the school grounds, in real time,
by name. Almost certainly, it had been created during the original
raising of Hogwarts. It was <em>not good</em> that errors were
starting to pop up. Chances were that no one except Dumbledore
could fix it if it was broken.</p>
<p>And the Weasley twins weren't about to turn the Map over to
Dumbledore. It would have been an unforgivable insult to the
Marauders - the four unknowns who'd managed to steal part of the
<em>Hogwarts security system</em>, something probably forged by
Salazar Slytherin himself, and twist it into <em>a tool for student
pranking</em>.</p>
<p>Some might have considered it disrespectful.</p>
<p>Some might have considered it criminal.</p>
<p>The Weasley twins firmly believed that if Godric Gryffindor had
been around to see it, he would have approved.</p>
<p>The brothers walked on and on and on, mostly in silence. The
Weasley twins talked to each other when they were thinking through
new pranks, or when one of them knew something the other didn't.
Otherwise there wasn't much point. If they already knew the same
information, they tended to think the same thoughts and make the
same decisions.</p>
<p>(Back in the old days, whenever magical identical twins were
born, it had been the custom to kill one of them after birth.)</p>
<p>In time, Fred and George clambered out into a dusty cellar,
strewn with barrels and racks of strange ingredients.</p>
<p>Fred and George waited. It wouldn't have been polite to do
anything else.</p>
<p>Before too long a thin old man in black pajamas clambered down
the steps that led into the cellar, yawning. "Hello, boys," said
Ambrosius Flume. "I wasn't expecting you tonight. Out of stock
already?"</p>
<p>Fred and George decided that Fred would speak.</p>
<p>"Not exactly, Mr. Flume," said Fred. "We were hoping you could
help us with something considerably more... interesting."</p>
<p>"Now, boys," said Flume, sounding severe, "I hope you didn't
wake me up just so I could tell you again that I'm not selling you
any merchandise that could get you into real trouble. Not until
you're sixteen, anyways -"</p>
<p>George drew forth an item from his robes, and wordlessly passed
it to Flume. "Have you seen this?" said Fred.</p>
<p>Flume looked at yesterday's edition of the <em>Daily
Prophet</em> and nodded, scowling. The headline on the paper read
THE NEXT DARK LORD? and showed a young boy which some student's
camera had managed to catch in an uncharacteristically cold and
grim expression.</p>
<p>"I can't believe that Malfoy," Flume snapped. "Going after the
boy when he's only eleven! The man ought to be ground up and used
to make chocolates!"</p>
<p>Fred and George blinked in unison. <em>Malfoy</em> was behind
Rita Skeeter? Harry Potter hadn't warned them about that... which
surely meant that Harry didn't know. He never would have brought
them in if he did...</p>
<p>Fred and George exchanged glances. Well, Harry didn't
<em>need</em> to know until after the job was done.</p>
<p>"Mr. Flume," Fred said quietly, "the Boy-Who-Lived needs your
help."</p>
<p>Flume looked at them both.</p>
<p>Then he let out his breath with a sigh.</p>
<p>"All right," said Flume, "what do you want?"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Act 6:</em></p>
<p>When Rita Skeeter was intent on a tasty prey, she didn't tend to
notice the scurrying ants who constituted the rest of the universe,
which was how she almost bumped into the balding young man who'd
stepped into her pathway.</p>
<p>"Miss Skeeter," said the man, sounding rather severe and cold
for someone whose face looked that young. "Fancy running into you
here."</p>
<p>"Out of my way, buster!" snapped Rita, and tried to step around
him.</p>
<p>The man in her pathway matched the movement so perfectly that it
was like neither of them had moved at all, just stood still while
the street shifted around them.</p>
<p>Rita's eyes narrowed. "Who do you think you are?"</p>
<p>"How very foolish," the man said dryly. "It would have been wise
to memorize the face of the disguised Death Eater training Harry
Potter to be the next Dark Lord. After all," a thin smile,
"<em>that</em> certainly sounds like someone you wouldn't want to
run into on the street, especially after doing a hatchet job on him
in the newspaper."</p>
<p>Rita took a moment to place the reference. <em>This</em> was
Quirinus Quirrell? He looked too young and too old at the same
time; his face, if it relaxed from its severe and condescending
pose, would belong to someone in his late thirties. And his hair
was already falling out? Couldn't he afford a healer?</p>
<p>No, that wasn't important, she had a time and a place and a
beetle to be. She'd just received an anonymous tip about Madam
Bones making time with one of her younger assistants. That would be
worth quite a bonus if she could manage to verify it, Bones was
high on the hit list. The tipster had said that Bones and her young
assistant were due to eat lunch in a special room at Mary's Place,
a very popular room for certain purposes; a room which, she'd
found, was secure against all listening devices, but not proof
against a beautiful blue beetle nestled up against one wall...</p>
<p>"Out of my <em>way!</em> " Rita said, and tried to push Quirrell
from her path. Quirrell's arm brushed her own, deflecting, and Rita
staggered as the thrust went into the thin air.</p>
<p>Quirrell pulled up the sleeve of his left robe, showing his left
arm. "Observe," said Quirrell, "no Dark Mark. I would like your
paper to publish a retraction."</p>
<p>Rita let out an incredulous laugh. Of course the man wasn't a
real Death Eater. The paper wouldn't have published it if he was.
"Forget it, buster. Now take a hike."</p>
<p>Quirrell stared at her for a moment.</p>
<p>Then he smiled.</p>
<p>"Miss Skeeter," said Quirrell, "I had hoped to find some lever
that would prove persuasive. Yet I find that I cannot deny myself
the pleasure of simply crushing you."</p>
<p>"It's been tried. Now get out of my way, buster, or I'll find
some Aurors and have you arrested for obstruction of
journalism."</p>
<p>Quirrell swept her a small bow, and then walked past. "Goodbye,
Rita Skeeter," said his voice from behind her.</p>
<p>As Rita bulled on ahead, she noted in the back of her mind that
the man was whistling a tune as he walked away.</p>
<p>Like <em>that</em> would scare her.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Act 4:</em></p>
<p>"Sorry, count me out," said Lee Jordan. "I'm more the giant
spider type."</p>
<p>The Boy-Who-Lived had said that he had <em>important</em> work
for the Order of Chaos, something serious and secret, more
significant and difficult than their usual run of pranks.</p>
<p>And then Harry Potter had launched into a speech that was
inspiring, yet vague. A speech to the effect that Fred and George
and Lee had tremendous potential if they could just learn to be
<em>weirder.</em> To make people's lives <em>surreal,</em> instead
of just surprising them with the equivalents of buckets of water
propped above doors. (Fred and George had exchanged interested
looks, they'd never thought of that one.) Harry Potter had invoked
a picture of the prank they'd pulled on Neville - which, Harry had
mentioned with some remorse, the Sorting Hat had chewed him out on
- but which must have made Neville <em>doubt his own sanity.</em>
For Neville it would have felt like being suddenly transported into
an alternate universe. The same way everyone else had felt when
they'd seen Snape apologize. That was the <em>true power of
pranking.</em></p>
<p><em>Are you with me?</em> Harry Potter had cried, and Lee Jordan
had answered no.</p>
<p>"Count us <em>in</em>," said Fred, or possibly George, for there
was no doubt that Godric Gryffindor would have said yes.</p>
<p>Lee Jordan gave a regretful grin, and stood up, and left the
deserted and Quieted corridor where the four members of the Order
of Chaos had met and sat down in a conspiratorial circle.</p>
<p>The three members of the Order of Chaos got down to
business.</p>
<p>(It wasn't <em>that</em> sad. Fred and George would still work
with Lee on giant spider pranks, same as ever. They'd only started
calling it the Order of Chaos in order to recruit Harry Potter,
after Ron had told them about Harry being weird and evil, and Fred
and George had decided to save Harry by showing him true friendship
and kindness. Thankfully this no longer seemed necessary - although
they weren't <em>quite</em> sure about that...)</p>
<p>"So," said one of the twins, "what's this about?"</p>
<p>"Rita Skeeter," said Harry. "Do you know who she is?"</p>
<p>Fred and George nodded, frowning.</p>
<p>"She's been asking questions about me."</p>
<p>That wasn't good news.</p>
<p>"Can you guess what I want you to do?"</p>
<p>Fred and George looked at each other, a bit puzzled. "You want
us to slip her some of our more interesting candies?"</p>
<p>"No," said Harry. "No, no, <em>no!</em> That's giant-spider
thinking! Come on, what would <em>you</em> do if you heard that
Rita Skeeter was looking for rumors about <em>you?</em> "</p>
<p>That made it obvious.</p>
<p>Grins slowly started on the faces of Fred and George.</p>
<p>"Start rumors about ourselves," they replied.</p>
<p>"<em>Exactly,</em>" said Harry, grinning widely. "But these
can't be just <em>any</em> rumors. I want to teach people never to
believe what the newspaper says about Harry Potter, any more than
Muggles believe what the newspaper says about Elvis. At first I
just thought about flooding Rita Skeeter with so many rumors that
she wouldn't know what to believe, but then she'll just cherry-pick
the ones that sound plausible and bad. So what I want you to do is
create a fake story about me, and get Rita Skeeter to believe it
somehow. But it has to be something that, afterward, everyone will
<em>know</em> was fake. We want to fool Rita Skeeter and her
editors, and <em>afterward</em> have the proof come out that it was
false. And of course - given that those are the requirements - the
story has to be as <em>ridiculous</em> as it can possibly be, and
still get printed. Do you understand what I want you to do?"</p>
<p>"Not exactly..." Fred or George said slowly. "You want us to
<em>invent</em> the story?"</p>
<p>"I want you to do <em>all</em> of it," Harry Potter said. "I'm
sort of busy right now, plus I want to be able to say truthfully
that I had no idea what was coming. Surprise me."</p>
<p>For a moment there was a very evil grin on the faces of Fred and
George.</p>
<p>Then they turned serious. "But Harry, we don't really know how
to do anything like that -"</p>
<p>"So figure it out," Harry said. "I have confidence in you. Not
<em>total</em> confidence, but if you <em>can't</em> do it,
<em>tell</em> me that, and I'll try someone else, or do it myself.
If you have a really good idea - for both the ridiculous story, and
how to convince Rita Skeeter and her editors to print it - then you
can go ahead and do it. But don't go with something mediocre. If
you can't come up with something <em>awesome</em>, just say
so."</p>
<p>Fred and George exchanged worried glances.</p>
<p>"I can't think of anything," said George.</p>
<p>"Neither can I," said Fred. "Sorry."</p>
<p>Harry stared at them.</p>
<p>And then Harry began to explain how you went about thinking of
things.</p>
<p>It had been known to take longer than two seconds, said
Harry.</p>
<p>You <em>never</em> called <em>any</em> question impossible, said
Harry, until you had taken an actual clock and thought about it for
five minutes, by the motion of the minute hand. Not five minutes
metaphorically, five minutes by a physical clock.</p>
<p>And <em>furthermore,</em> Harry said, his voice emphatic and his
right hand thumping hard on the floor, you did <em>not</em> start
out immediately looking for solutions.</p>
<p>Harry then launched into an explanation of a test done by
someone named Norman Maier, who was something called an
organizational psychologist, and who'd asked two different sets of
problem-solving groups to tackle a problem.</p>
<p>The problem, Harry said, had involved three employees doing
three jobs. The junior employee wanted to just do the easiest job.
The senior employee wanted to rotate between jobs, to avoid
boredom. An efficiency expert had recommended giving the junior
person the easiest job and the senior person the hardest job, which
would be 20% more productive.</p>
<p><em>One</em> set of problem-solving groups had been given the
instruction "Do not propose solutions until the problem has been
discussed as thoroughly as possible without suggesting any."</p>
<p>The other set of problem-solving groups had been given no
instructions. And those people had done the natural thing, and
reacted to the presence of a problem by proposing solutions. And
people had gotten attached to those solutions, and started fighting
about them, and arguing about the relative importance of freedom
versus efficiency and so on.</p>
<p>The first set of problem-solving groups, the ones given
instructions to <em>discuss</em> the problem first and
<em>then</em> solve it, had been far more likely to hit upon the
solution of letting the junior employee keep the easiest job and
rotating the other two people between the other two jobs, for what
the expert's data said would be a 19% improvement.</p>
<p>Starting out by looking for solutions was taking things
<em>entirely out of order.</em> Like starting a meal with dessert,
only <em>bad.</em></p>
<p>(Harry also quoted someone named Robyn Dawes as saying that the
harder a problem was, the more likely people were to try to solve
it immediately.)</p>
<p>So Harry was going to leave this problem to Fred and George, and
they would discuss all the aspects of it and brainstorm anything
they thought might be remotely relevant. And they shouldn't try to
come up with an actual solution until they'd finished doing that,
unless of course they <em>did</em> happen to randomly think of
something awesome, in which case they could write it down for
afterward and then go back to thinking. And he didn't want to hear
back from them about any so-called <em>failures to think of
anything</em> for at least a week. Some people spent
<em>decades</em> trying to think of things.</p>
<p>"Any questions?" said Harry.</p>
<p>Fred and George stared at each other.</p>
<p>"I can't think of any."</p>
<p>"Neither can I."</p>
<p>Harry coughed gently. "You didn't ask about your budget."</p>
<p><em>Budget?</em> they thought.</p>
<p>"I could just tell you the amount," Harry said. "But I think
<em>this</em> will be more <em>inspiring</em>."</p>
<p>Harry's hands dipped into his robe, and brought forth -</p>
<p>Fred and George almost fell over, even though they were sitting
down.</p>
<p>"Don't spend it for the sake of spending it," Harry said. On the
stone floor in front of them gleamed an absolutely ridiculous
amount of money. "Only spend it if awesomeness requires; and what
awesomeness does require, don't hesitate to spend. If there's
anything left over, just return it afterward, I trust you. Oh, and
you get ten percent of what's there, regardless of how much you end
up spending -"</p>
<p>"We <em>can't!</em> " blurted one of the twins. "We don't accept
money for that sort of thing!"</p>
<p>(The twins never took money for doing anything illegal. Unknown
to Ambrosius Flume, they were selling all of his merchandise at
zero percent markup. Fred and George wanted to be able to testify -
under Veritaserum if necessary - that they had not been
profiteering criminals, just providing a public service.)</p>
<p>Harry frowned at them. "But I'm asking you to put in some real
work here. A grownup would get paid for doing something like this,
and it would <em>still</em> count as a favor for a friend. You
can't just hire people for this sort of thing."</p>
<p>Fred and George shook their heads.</p>
<p>"Fine," Harry said. "I'll just get you expensive Christmas
presents, and if you try returning them to me I'll burn them. Now
you don't even <em>know</em> how much I'm going to spend on you,
except, obviously, that it's going to be more than if you'd just
taken the money. And I'm going to buy you those presents
<em>anyway,</em> so think about <em>that</em> before you tell me
<em>you can't think of anything awesome</em>."</p>
<p>Harry stood up, smiling, and turned to go while Fred and George
were still gaping in shock. He strode a few steps away, and then
turned back.</p>
<p>"Oh, one last thing," Harry said. "Leave Professor Quirrell out
of whatever you do. He doesn't like publicity. I know it'd be
easier to get people to believe weird things about the Defense
Professor than anyone else, and I'm sorry to have to get in your
way like that, but please, leave Professor Quirrell out of it."</p>
<p>And Harry turned again and took a few more steps -</p>
<p>Looked back one last time, and said, softly, "Thank you."</p>
<p>And left.</p>
<p>There was a long pause after he'd departed.</p>
<p>"So," said one.</p>
<p>"So," said the other.</p>
<p>"The Defense Professor doesn't like publicity, does he."</p>
<p>"Harry doesn't know us very well, does he."</p>
<p>"No, he doesn't."</p>
<p>"But we won't use his money for that, of course."</p>
<p>"Of course not, that wouldn't be right. We'll do the Defense
Professor separately."</p>
<p>"We'll get some Gryffindors to write Skeeter, and say..."</p>
<p>"...his sleeve lifted up one time in Defense class, and they saw
the Dark Mark..."</p>
<p>"...and he's probably teaching Harry Potter all sorts of
dreadful things..."</p>
<p>"...and he's the worst Defense Professor anyone remembers even
in Hogwarts, he's not just <em>failing</em> to teach us, he's
getting everything wrong, the complete opposite of what it should
be..."</p>
<p>"...like when he claimed that you could only cast the Killing
Curse using love, which made it pretty much useless."</p>
<p>"I like that one."</p>
<p>"Thanks."</p>
<p>"I bet the Defense Professor likes it too."</p>
<p>"He does have a sense of humor. He wouldn't have called us what
he did if he didn't have a sense of humor."</p>
<p>"But are we really going to be able to do Harry's job?"</p>
<p>"Harry said to discuss the problem before trying to solve it, so
let's do that."</p>
<p>The Weasley twins decided that George would be the enthusiastic
one while Fred doubted.</p>
<p>"It all seems sort of contradictory," said Fred. "He wants it to
be ridiculous enough that everyone laughs at Skeeter and knows it's
wrong, and he wants Skeeter to believe it. We can't do both things
at the same time."</p>
<p>"We'll have to fake up some evidence to convince Skeeter," said
George.</p>
<p>"Was that a solution?" said Fred.</p>
<p>They considered this.</p>
<p>"Maybe," said George, "but I don't think we should be all
<em>that</em> strict about it, do you?"</p>
<p>The twins shrugged helplessly.</p>
<p>"So then the fake evidence has to be good enough to convince
Skeeter," said Fred. "Can we really do that on our own?"</p>
<p>"We don't have to do it on our own," said George, and pointed to
the pile of money. "We can hire other people to help us."</p>
<p>The twins got a thoughtful look on their face.</p>
<p>"That could use up Harry's budget pretty fast," said Fred. "This
is a lot of money for us, but it's not a lot of money for someone
like Flume."</p>
<p>"Maybe people will give discounts if they know it's for Harry,"
said George. "But most importantly of all, whatever we do, it has
to be <em>impossible</em>."</p>
<p>Fred blinked. "What do you mean, <em>impossible?</em> "</p>
<p>"So impossible that we don't get in trouble, because no one
believes we could have done it. So impossible that even Harry
starts wondering. It has to be surreal, it has to make people doubt
their own sanity, it has to be... <em>better than Harry.</em>"</p>
<p>Fred's eyes were wide in astonishment. This happened sometimes,
between them, but not often. "But why?"</p>
<p>"They were pranks. They were <em>all</em> pranks. The pie was a
prank. The Remembrall was a prank. Kevin Entwhistle's cat was a
prank. <em>Snape</em> was a prank. <em>We're</em> the best
pranksters in Hogwarts, are we going to roll over and give up
without a fight?"</p>
<p>"He's the Boy-Who-Lived," said Fred.</p>
<p>"And <em>we're</em> the Weasley twins! He's <em>challenging</em>
us. He said we could do what he does. But I bet he doesn't think
we'll ever be as good as <em>him.</em>"</p>
<p>"He's right," said Fred, feeling rather nervous. The Weasley
twins did <em>sometimes</em> disagree even when they had all the
same information, but every time they did it seemed unnatural, like
at least one of them must be doing something wrong. "This is
<em>Harry Potter</em> we're talking about. He can do the
impossible. We can't."</p>
<p>"Yes we can," said George. "And we have to be <em>more</em>
impossible than him."</p>
<p>"But -" said Fred.</p>
<p>"It's what Godric Gryffindor would do," said George.</p>
<p>That settled it, and the twins snapped back into... whatever it
was that was normal for them.</p>
<p>"All right, then -"</p>
<p>"- let's think about it."</p>

<p>Professor Quirrell's office hours consisted of 11:40 to 11:55 AM
on Thursday. That was for all of his students in all years. It cost
a Quirrell point just to knock on the door, and if he didn't think
your reason was worth his time, you would lose another fifty.</p>
<p>Harry knocked on the door.</p>
<p>There was a pause. Then a biting voice said, "I suppose you may
as well come in, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>And before Harry could touch the doorknob, the door slammed
open, hitting the wall with a sharp crack that sounded like
something might have broken in the wood, or the stone, or both.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was leaning back in his chair and reading a
suspiciously old-looking book, bound in night-blue leather with
silver runes on the spine. His eyes had not moved from the pages.
"I am not in a good mood, Mr. Potter. And when I am not a good
mood, I am not a pleasant person to be around. For your own sake,
conduct your business quickly and depart."</p>
<p>A cold chill seeped from the room, as though it contained
something that cast darkness the way lamps cast light, and which
hadn't been fully shaded.</p>
<p>Harry was a bit taken aback. <em>Not in a good mood</em> didn't
quite seem to cover it. What could be bothering Professor Quirrell
this much...?</p>
<p>Well, you didn't just walk out on friends when they were feeling
down. Harry cautiously advanced into the room. "Is there anything I
can do to help -"</p>
<p>"No," said Professor Quirrell, still not looking up from the
book.</p>
<p>"I mean, if you've been dealing with idiots and want someone
sane to talk to..."</p>
<p>There was a surprisingly long pause.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell slammed the book shut and it vanished with a
small whispering sound. He looked up, then, and Harry flinched.</p>
<p>"I suppose an intelligent conversation would be pleasant for
<em>me</em> at this point," said Professor Quirrell in the same
biting tone that had invited Harry to enter. "<em>You</em> are not
likely to find it so, be warned."</p>
<p>Harry drew a deep breath. "I promise I won't mind if you snap at
me. What happened?"</p>
<p>The cold in the room seemed to deepen. "A sixth-year Gryffindor
cast a curse at one of my more promising students, a sixth-year
Slytherin."</p>
<p>Harry swallowed. "What... sort of curse?"</p>
<p>And the fury on Professor Quirrell's face was no longer
contained. "Why bother to ask an unimportant question like that,
Mr. Potter? Our friend the sixth-year Gryffindor did not think it
was important!"</p>
<p>"Are you <em>serious?</em> " Harry said before he could stop
himself.</p>
<p>"No, I'm in a terrible mood today for no particular reason.
<em>Yes I'm serious, you fool!</em> He didn't know. He <em>actually
didn't know.</em> I didn't believe it until the Aurors confirmed it
under Veritaserum. He is in his <em>sixth year at Hogwarts</em> and
he cast a high-level Dark curse <em>without knowing what it
did.</em>"</p>
<p>"You don't mean," Harry said, "that he was <em>mistaken</em>
about what it did, that he somehow read the wrong spell description
-"</p>
<p>"All he knew was that it was meant to be directed at an enemy.
He <em>knew</em> that was all he knew."</p>
<p>And that had been enough to cast the spell. "I do not understand
how anything with that small a brain could walk upright."</p>
<p>"Indeed, Mr. Potter," said Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>There was a pause. Professor Quirrell leaned forward and picked
up the silver inkwell from his desk, turning it around in his
hands, staring at it as though wondering how he could go about
torturing an inkwell to death.</p>
<p>"Was the sixth-year Slytherin seriously hurt?" said Harry.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Was the sixth-year Gryffindor raised by Muggles?"</p>
<p>"<em>Yes.</em>"</p>
<p>"Is Dumbledore refusing to expel him because the poor boy didn't
know?"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's hands whitened on the inkwell. "<em>Do you
have a point, Mr. Potter, or are you just stating the
obvious?</em> "</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell," said Harry gravely, "all the Muggle-raised
students in Hogwarts need a safety lecture in which they are told
the things so ridiculously obvious that no wizardborn would ever
think to mention them. Don't cast curses if you don't know what
they do, if you discover something dangerous don't tell the world
about it, don't brew high-level potions without supervision in a
bathroom, the reason why there are underage magic laws, all the
basics."</p>
<p>"Why?" said Professor Quirrell. "Let the stupid ones die before
they breed."</p>
<p>"If you don't mind losing a few sixth-year Slytherins along with
them."</p>
<p>The inkwell caught fire in Professor Quirrell's hands and burned
with a terrible slowness, hideous black-orange flames tearing at
the metal and seeming to take tiny bites from it, the silver
twisting as it melted, as though it were trying and failing to
escape. There was a tinny shrieking sound, as though the metal were
screaming.</p>
<p>"I suppose you are right," Professor Quirrell said with a
resigned smile. "I shall design a lecture to ensure that
Muggleborns who are too stupid to live do not take anyone valuable
with them as they depart."</p>
<p>The inkwell went on screaming and burning in Professor
Quirrell's hands, tiny droplets of metal, still on fire, now
dripping to the desk, as though the inkwell were crying.</p>
<p>"You're not running away," observed Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>Harry opened his mouth -</p>
<p>"If you're about to say you're not scared of me," said Professor
Quirrell, "<em>don't.</em>"</p>
<p>"You are the scariest person I know," Harry said, "and one of
the top reasons for that is your control. I simply can't imagine
hearing that you'd hurt someone you had not made a deliberate
decision to hurt."</p>
<p>The fire in Professor Quirrell's hands winked out, and he
carefully placed the ruined inkwell on his desk. "You say the
nicest things, Mr. Potter. Have you been taking lessons in
flattery? From, perhaps, Mr. Malfoy?"</p>
<p>Harry kept his expression blank, and realized one second too
late that it might as well have been a signed confession. Professor
Quirrell didn't care what your expression looked like, he cared
which states of mind made it likely.</p>
<p>"I see," said Professor Quirrell. "Mr. Malfoy is a useful friend
to have, Mr. Potter, and there is much he can teach you, but I hope
you have not made the mistake of trusting him with too many
confidences."</p>
<p>"He knows nothing which I fear becoming known," said Harry.</p>
<p>"Well done," said Professor Quirrell, smiling slightly. "So what
was your original business here?"</p>
<p>"I think I'm done with the preliminary exercises in Occlumency
and ready for the tutor."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell nodded. "I shall conduct you to Gringotts
this Sunday." He paused, looking at Harry, and smiled. "And we
might even make it a little outing, if you like. I've just had a
pleasant thought."</p>
<p>Harry nodded, smiling back.</p>
<p>As Harry left the office, he heard Professor Quirrell humming a
small tune.</p>
<p>Harry was glad he'd been able to cheer him up.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>That Sunday there seemed to be a rather large number of people
whispering in the hallways, at least when Harry Potter walked past
them.</p>
<p>And a lot of pointed fingers.</p>
<p>And a great deal of female giggling.</p>
<p>It had started at breakfast, when someone had asked Harry if
he'd heard the news, and Harry had quickly interrupted and said
that if the news was written by Rita Skeeter then he didn't want to
<em>hear</em> about it, he wanted to read it in the paper
himself.</p>
<p>It had then developed that not many students at Hogwarts got
copies of the <em>Daily Prophet,</em> and that the copies which had
not already been bought up from their owners were being passed
around in some sort of complicated order and nobody really knew who
had one at the moment...</p>
<p>So Harry had used a Quieting Charm and gone on to eat his
breakfast, trusting to his seat-mates to wave off the many, many
questioners, and doing his best to ignore the incredulity, the
laughter, the congratulatory smiles, the pitying looks, the fearful
glances, and the dropped plates as new people came down for
breakfast and heard.</p>
<p>Harry was feeling <em>rather</em> curious, but it
<em>really</em> wouldn't have done to spoil the artistry by hearing
it secondhand.</p>
<p>He'd done homework in the safety of his trunk for the next
couple of hours, after telling his dormmates to come get him if
anyone found him an original newspaper.</p>
<p>Harry was still ignorant at 10AM, when he'd left Hogwarts in a
carriage with Professor Quirrell, who was in the front right, and
currently slumped over in zombie-mode. Harry was sitting diagonally
across, as far away as the carriage allowed, in the back left. Even
so, Harry had a constant feeling of doom as the carriage rattled
over a small path through a section of non-forbidden forest. It
made it a bit hard to read, especially since the material was
difficult, and Harry suddenly wished he was reading one of his
childhood science fiction books instead -</p>
<p>"We're outside the wards, Mr. Potter," said Professor Quirrell's
voice from the front. "Time to go."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell carefully disembarked from the carriage,
bracing himself as he stepped down. Harry, on his own side, jumped
off.</p>
<p>Harry was wondering exactly how they'd get there when Professor
Quirrell said "Catch!" and threw a bronze Knut at him, and Harry
caught it without thinking.</p>
<p>A giant intangible hook caught at Harry's abdomen and yanked him
back, hard, only without any sense of acceleration, and an instant
later Harry was standing in the middle of Diagon Alley.</p>
<p>(<em>Excuse me, what?</em> said his brain.)</p>
<p>(<em>We just teleported,</em> explained Harry.)</p>
<p>(<em>That didn't used to happen in the ancestral
environment,</em> Harry's brain complained, and disoriented
him.)</p>
<p>Harry staggered as his feet adjusted to the brick of the street
instead of the dirt of the forest corridor they had been
traversing. He straightened, still dizzy, with the bustling witches
and wizards seeming to sway slightly, and the cries of the
shopkeepers seeming to move around in his hearing, as his brain
tried to place a world to be located in.</p>
<p>Moments later, there was a sort of sucking-popping sound from a
few paces behind Harry, and when Harry turned to look Professor
Quirrell was there.</p>
<p>"Do you mind -" said Harry, at the same time as Professor
Quirrell said, "I'm afraid I -"</p>
<p>Harry stopped, Professor Quirrell didn't.</p>
<p>"- need to go off and set something in motion, Mr. Potter. As it
has been thoroughly explained to me that I am responsible for
anything whatsoever that happens to you, I'll be leaving you with
-"</p>
<p>"Newsstand," Harry said.</p>
<p>"Pardon?"</p>
<p>"Or anywhere I can buy a copy of the <em>Daily Prophet.</em> Put
me there and I'll be happy."</p>
<p>Shortly after, Harry had been delivered into a bookstore,
accompanied by several quietly spoken, ambiguous threats. And the
shopkeeper had gotten <em>less</em> ambiguous threats, judging by
the way he had cringed, and how his eyes now kept darting between
Harry and the entrance.</p>
<p>If the bookstore burned down, Harry was going to stick around in
the middle of the fire until Professor Quirrell got back.</p>
<p>Meanwhile -</p>
<p>Harry took a quick glance around.</p>
<p>The bookstore seemed rather small and shoddy, with only four
rows of bookcases visible, and the nearest shelf Harry's eyes had
jumped to seemed to deal with narrow, cheaply bound books with grim
titles like <em>The Massacre of Albania in the Fifteenth
Century.</em></p>
<p>First things first. Harry stepped over to the seller's
counter.</p>
<p>"Pardon me," said Harry, "One copy of the <em>Daily
Prophet,</em> please."</p>
<p>"Five Sickles," said the shopkeeper. "Sorry, kid, I've only got
three left."</p>
<p>Five Sickles dropped onto the counter. Harry had the feeling he
could have bargained him down a couple of points, but at this point
he didn't really care.</p>
<p>The shopkeeper's eyes widened and he seemed to really notice
Harry for the first time. "<em>You!</em> "</p>
<p>"<em>Me!</em> "</p>
<p>"Is it <em>true?</em> Are you <em>really</em> -"</p>
<p>"<em>Shut up!</em> Sorry, I've been waiting <em>all day</em> to
read this in the original newspaper instead of hearing about it
secondhand, so please just <em>hand it over</em>, all right?"</p>
<p>The shopkeeper stared at Harry for a moment, then wordlessly
reached under the counter and passed over one folded copy of the
<em>Daily Prophet</em>.</p>
<p>The headline read:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>HARRY POTTER<br>
SECRETLY BETROTHED<br>
TO GINEVRA WEASLEY</em></p>
<p>Harry stared.</p>
<p>He lifted the newspaper off the counter, softly, reverently,
like he was handling an original Escher artwork, and unbent it to
read...</p>
<p>...about the evidence that had convinced Rita Skeeter.</p>
<p>...and some interesting further details.</p>
<p>...and yet more evidence.</p>
<p>Fred and George had cleared it with their sister first, surely?
Yes, of course they had. There was a picture of Ginevra Weasley
sighing longingly over what Harry could see, looking closely, was a
photo of himself. That had to have been staged.</p>
<p>But <em>how</em> on <em>Earth...?</em></p>
<p>Harry was sitting in a cheap folding chair, rereading the
newspaper for the fourth time, when the door whispered softly and
Professor Quirrell came back into the shop.</p>
<p>"My apologies for - <em>what</em> in Merlin's name are you
reading?"</p>
<p>"It would seem," said Harry, awe in his voice, "that one Mr.
Arthur Weasley was placed under the Imperius Curse by a Death Eater
whom my father killed, thus creating a debt to House Potter, which
my father demanded be repaid by the hand in marriage of the
recently born Ginevra Weasley. Do people actually do that sort of
thing around here?"</p>
<p>"How could Miss Skeeter <em>possibly</em> be fool enough to
believe -"</p>
<p>And Professor Quirrell's voice cut off.</p>
<p>Harry had been reading the newspaper held vertically and
unfolded, which meant that Professor Quirrell, from where he was
standing, could see the text underneath the headline.</p>
<p>The look of shock on Professor Quirrell's face was a work of art
almost on par with the newspaper itself.</p>
<p>"Don't worry," said Harry cheerfully, "it's all fake."</p>
<p>From elsewhere in the store, he heard the shopkeeper gasp. There
was the sound of a stack of books falling over.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter..." Professor Quirrell said slowly, "are you
<em>sure</em> of that?"</p>
<p>"Quite sure. Shall we go?"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell nodded, looking rather abstracted, and Harry
folded the newspaper back up, and followed him out of the door.</p>
<p>For some reason Harry didn't seem to be hearing any street
noises now.</p>
<p>They walked in silence for thirty seconds before Professor
Quirrell spoke. "Miss Skeeter viewed the original proceedings of
the restricted Wizengamot session."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"The <em>original proceedings of the Wizengamot.</em>"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"<em>I</em> would have trouble doing that."</p>
<p>"Really?" said Harry. "Because if my suspicions are correct,
this was done by a Hogwarts student."</p>
<p>"That is beyond impossible," Professor Quirrell said flatly.
"Mr. Potter... I regret to say that this young lady expects to
marry you."</p>
<p>"But <em>that</em> is improbable," said Harry. "To quote Douglas
Adams, the impossible often has a kind of integrity which the
merely improbable lacks."</p>
<p>"I see your point," Professor Quirrell said slowly. "But... no,
Mr. Potter. It may be impossible, but I can <em>imagine</em>
tampering with the Wizengamot proceedings. It is
<em>unimaginable</em> that the Grand Manager of Gringotts should
affix the seal of his office in witness to a false betrothal
contract, and Miss Skeeter personally verified that seal."</p>
<p>"Indeed," said Harry, "you would expect the Grand Manager of
Gringotts to get involved with that much money changing hands. It
seems Mr. Weasley was greatly in debt, and so demanded an
additional payment of ten thousand Galleons -"</p>
<p>"<em>Ten thousand</em> Galleons for a <em>Weasley?</em> You
could buy the daughter of a Noble House for that!"</p>
<p>"Excuse me," Harry said. "I really have to ask at this point, do
people actually do that sort of thing around here -"</p>
<p>"Rarely," said Professor Quirrell, with a frown on his face.
"And not at all, I suspect, since the Dark Lord departed. I suppose
that according to the newspaper, your father just paid it?"</p>
<p>"He didn't have any choice," said Harry. "Not if he wanted to
fulfill the conditions of the prophecy."</p>
<p>"<em>Give me that,</em>" said Professor Quirrell, and the
newspaper leaped out of Harry's hand so fast that he got a paper
cut.</p>
<p>Harry automatically put the finger in his mouth to suck on,
feeling rather shocked, and turned to remonstrate with Professor
Quirrell -</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell had stopped short in the middle of the
street, and his eyes were flickering rapidly back and forth as an
invisible force held the newspaper suspended before him.</p>
<p>Harry watched, gaping in open awe, as the newspaper opened to
reveal pages two and three. And not much long after, four and five.
It was like the man had cast off a pretense of mortality.</p>
<p>And after a troublingly short time, the paper neatly folded
itself up again. Professor Quirrell plucked it from the air and
tossed it to Harry, who caught it in sheer reflex; and then
Professor Quirrell started walking again, and Harry automatically
trudged after.</p>
<p>"No," said Professor Quirrell, "that prophecy didn't sound quite
right to me either."</p>
<p>Harry nodded, still stunned.</p>
<p>"The centaurs could have been put under an <em>Imperius</em>,"
Professor Quirrell said, frowning, "<em>that</em> seems
understandable. What magic can make, magic can corrupt, and it is
not unthinkable that the Great Seal of Gringotts could be twisted
to another's hand. The Unspeakable could have been impersonated
with Polyjuice, likewise the Bavarian seer. And with
<em>enough</em> effort it might be possible to tamper with the
proceedings of the Wizengamot. Do you have any idea how that was
done?"</p>
<p>"I do not have one single plausible hypothesis," said Harry. "I
do know it was done on a total budget of forty Galleons."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell stopped short and whirled on Harry. His
expression was now completely incredulous. "Forty Galleons will pay
a competent ward-breaker to open a path into a home you wish to
burglarize! Forty <em>thousand</em> Galleons <em>might</em> pay a
team of the greatest professional criminals in the world to tamper
with the proceedings of the Wizengamot!"</p>
<p>Harry shrugged helplessly. "I'll remember that the next time I
want to save thirty-nine thousand, nine hundred and sixty Galleons
by finding the right contractor."</p>
<p>"I do not say this often," said Professor Quirrell. "I am
impressed."</p>
<p>"Likewise," said Harry.</p>
<p>"And who is this incredible Hogwarts student?"</p>
<p>"I'm afraid I couldn't say."</p>
<p>Somewhat to Harry's surprise, Professor Quirrell made no
objection to this.</p>
<p>They walked in the direction of the Gringotts building,
thinking, for they were neither of them the sort of person who
would give up on the problem without considering it for at least
five minutes.</p>
<p>"I have a feeling," Harry said finally, "that we're coming at
this from the wrong angle. There's a tale I once heard about some
students who came into a physics class, and the teacher showed them
a large metal plate near a fire. She ordered them to feel the metal
plate, and they felt that the metal nearer the fire was cooler, and
the metal further away was warmer. And she said, write down your
guess for why this happens. So some students wrote down 'because of
how the metal conducts heat', and some students wrote down 'because
of how the air moves', and no one said 'this just seems
impossible', and the real answer was that before the students came
into the room, the teacher turned the plate around."</p>
<p>"Interesting," said Professor Quirrell. "That does sound
similar. Is there a moral?"</p>
<p>"That your strength as a rationalist is your ability to be more
confused by fiction than by reality," said Harry. "If you're
equally good at explaining any outcome, you have zero knowledge.
The students thought they could use words like 'because of heat
conduction' to explain anything, even a metal plate being cooler on
the side nearer the fire. So they didn't notice how confused they
were, and that meant they couldn't be more confused by falsehood
than by truth. If you tell me that the centaurs were under the
<em>Imperius</em> Curse, I still have the feeling of something
being not quite right. I notice that I'm still confused even after
hearing your explanation."</p>
<p>"Hm," said Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>They walked on further.</p>
<p>"I don't suppose," said Harry, "that it's possible to
<em>actually</em> swap people into alternate universes? Like, this
isn't our own Rita Skeeter, or they temporarily sent her somewhere
else?"</p>
<p>"If <em>that</em> was possible," Professor Quirrell said, his
voice rather dry, "would I still be <em>here?</em> "</p>
<p>And just as they were almost to the huge white front of the
Gringotts building, Professor Quirrell said:</p>
<p>"Ah. Of <em>course.</em> I see it now. Let me guess, the Weasley
twins?"</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " said Harry, his voice going up another octave
in pitch. "<em>How?</em> "</p>
<p>"I'm afraid I couldn't say."</p>
<p>"...That is <em>not</em> fair."</p>
<p>"I think it is extremely fair," said Professor Quirrell, and
they entered through the bronze doors.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The time was just before noon, and Harry and Professor Quirrell
were seated at the foot and head of a wide, long, flat table, in a
sumptuously appointed private room with thoroughly cushioned
couches and chairs along the walls, and soft curtains hanging
everywhere.</p>
<p>They were about to eat lunch in Mary's Place, which Professor
Quirrell had said was known to him as one of the best restaurants
in Diagon Alley, especially for - his voice had dropped
meaningfully - <em>certain purposes.</em></p>
<p>It was the nicest restaurant that Harry had ever been in, and it
was really eating away at Harry that Professor Quirrell was
treating <em>him</em> to the meal.</p>
<p>The first part of the mission, to find an Occlumency instructor,
had been a success. Professor Quirrell, smiling evilly, had told
Griphook to recommend the best he knew, and not worry about the
expense, since Dumbledore was paying it; and the goblin had smiled
in return. There might have been a certain amount of smiling on
Harry's part as well.</p>
<p>The second part of the plan had been a complete failure.</p>
<p>Harry was not allowed to take money out of his vault without
Headmaster Dumbledore or some other school official present, and
Professor Quirrell had not been given the vault key. Harry's Muggle
parents could not authorize it because they were Muggles, and
Muggles had around the same legal standing as children or kittens:
they were cute, so if you tortured them in public you could get
arrested, but they weren't <em>people</em>. Some reluctant
provision had been made for recognizing the parents of Muggleborns
as human in a limited sense, but Harry's adoptive parents did not
fall into that legal category.</p>
<p>It seemed that Harry was effectively an orphan in the eyes of
the wizarding world. As such, the Headmaster of Hogwarts, or his
designees <em>within</em> the school system, were Harry's guardians
until he graduated. Harry <em>could</em> breathe without
Dumbledore's permission, but only so long as the Headmaster did not
specifically prohibit it.</p>
<p>Harry had then asked if he could simply <em>tell</em> Griphook
how to diversify his investments beyond stacks of gold coins
sitting in his vault.</p>
<p>Griphook had stared blankly and asked what 'diversify'
meant.</p>
<p>Banks, it seemed, did not make investments. Banks stored your
gold coins in secure vaults for an annual fee.</p>
<p>The wizarding world did not have a concept of stock. Or equity.
Or corporations. Businesses were run by families out of their
personal vaults.</p>
<p>Loans were made by rich people, not banks. Though Gringotts
would witness the contract, for a fee, and enforce its collection,
for a much larger fee.</p>
<p>Good rich people let their friends borrow money and pay it back
whenever. <em>Bad</em> rich people charged you
<em>interest.</em></p>
<p>There was no secondary market in loans.</p>
<p>Evil rich people charged you annual interest rates of at least
20%.</p>
<p>Harry had stood up, turned away, and rested his head against the
wall.</p>
<p>Harry had asked if he needed the Headmaster's permission before
he could start a bank.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell had interrupted at this point, saying that it
was time for lunch, and swiftly conducted a fuming Harry out of the
bronze doors of Gringotts, through Diagon Alley, and to a fine
restaurant called Mary's Place, where a room had been reserved for
them. The owner had looked shocked at seeing Professor Quirrell
accompanied by Harry Potter, but had conducted them to the room
without complaint.</p>
<p>And Professor Quirrell had quite deliberately announced that he
would pay the bill, seeming to rather enjoy the look on Harry's
face.</p>
<p>"No," said Professor Quirrell to the waitress, "we will not
require menus. I will have the daily special accompanied by a
bottle of Chianti, and Mr. Potter will have the Diracawl soup to
start, followed by a plate of Roopo balls, and treacle pudding for
dessert."</p>
<p>The waitress, clad in robes that still looked severe and formal
while being rather shorter than usual, bowed respectfully and
departed, shutting the door behind her.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell waved a hand in the direction of the door,
and a bolt slid shut. "Note the bolt on the inside. This room, Mr.
Potter, is known as Mary's Room. It happens to be proof against all
scrying, and I do mean <em>all;</em> Dumbledore himself could
detect nothing of what happens here. Mary's Room is used by two
kinds of people. The first sort are engaged in illicit dalliances.
And the second sort lead interesting lives."</p>
<p>"<em>Really,</em>" said Harry.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell nodded.</p>
<p>Harry's lips were parted in anticipation. "It would be a waste
to just sit here and eat lunch, then, without doing anything
special."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell grinned, then took out his wand and flicked
it in the direction of the door. "Of course," he said, "people who
lead interesting lives take precautions more <em>thorough</em> than
the dalliers. I have just sealed us in. Nothing will now pass in or
out of this room - through the crack under the door, for example.
And..."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell then spoke no fewer than four different
Charms, none of which Harry recognized.</p>
<p>"Even that does not <em>really</em> suffice," said Professor
Quirrell. "If we were doing anything of truly great import, it
would be necessary to perform another twenty-three checks besides
those. If, say, Rita Skeeter knew or guessed that we would come
here, it is possible that she could be in this room wearing the
true Cloak of Invisibility. Or she could be an Animagus with a tiny
form, perhaps. There are tests to rule out such rare possibilities,
but to perform all of them would be arduous. Still, I wonder if I
should do them anyway, just so as not to teach you bad habits?" And
Professor Quirrell tapped a finger on his cheek, looking
abstracted.</p>
<p>"It's fine," Harry said, "I understand, and I'll remember."
Though he was a little disappointed that they weren't doing
anything of truly great import.</p>
<p>"Very well," Professor Quirrell said. He leaned back in his
chair, smiling broadly. "You wrought quite well today, Mr. Potter.
The basic notion was yours, I'm sure, even if you delegated the
execution. I don't think we'll be hearing much more from Rita
Skeeter after this. Lucius Malfoy will not be pleased with her
failure. If she's smart, she'll flee the country the instant she
realizes she's been fooled."</p>
<p>A sinking sensation began to dawn in Harry's stomach. "Lucius
was behind Rita Skeeter...?"</p>
<p>"Oh, you didn't realize that?" said Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>Harry hadn't thought about what would happen to Rita Skeeter
afterward.</p>
<p>At all.</p>
<p>Not in the slightest.</p>
<p>But she would get fired from her job, <em>of course</em> she
would be fired, she might have children going through Hogwarts for
all Harry knew, and now it was worse, much worse -</p>
<p>"Is Lucius going to have her killed?" Harry said in a barely
audible voice. Somewhere in his head, the Sorting Hat was screaming
at him.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell smiled dryly. "If you have not dealt with
journalists before, take it from me that the world gets a little
brighter every time one dies."</p>
<p>Harry jumped out of his chair with a convulsive movement, he had
to find Rita Skeeter and warn her before it was too late -</p>
<p>"<em>Sit down</em>," Professor Quirrell said sharply.
"<em>No</em>, Lucius won't kill her. But Lucius makes life
<em>extremely</em> unpleasant for those who serve him ill. Miss
Skeeter will flee and start her life over with a new name. <em>Sit
down,</em> Mr. Potter; there is nothing you can do at this point,
and you have a lesson to learn."</p>
<p>Harry sat down, slowly. There was a disappointed, annoyed look
on Professor Quirrell's face that was doing more to stop him than
the words.</p>
<p>"There are times," Professor Quirrell said, his voice cutting,
"when I worry that your brilliant Slytherin mind is simply wasted
on you. Repeat after me. Rita Skeeter was a vile, disgusting
woman."</p>
<p>"Rita Skeeter was a vile, disgusting woman," Harry said. He
wasn't comfortable saying it, but there didn't seem to be any other
possible actions, none at all.</p>
<p>"Rita Skeeter tried to destroy my reputation, but I executed an
ingenious plan and destroyed <em>her</em> reputation first."</p>
<p>"Rita Skeeter challenged me. She lost the game, and I won."</p>
<p>"Rita Skeeter was an obstacle to my future plans. I had no
choice but to deal with her if I wanted those plans to
succeed."</p>
<p>"Rita Skeeter was my enemy."</p>
<p>"I cannot possibly get anything done in life if I am not willing
to defeat my enemies."</p>
<p>"I have defeated one of my enemies today."</p>
<p>"I am a good boy."</p>
<p>"I deserve a special reward."</p>
<p>"Ah," said Professor Quirrell, who had been grinning a
benevolent smile for the last few lines, "I see I have succeeded in
catching your attention."</p>
<p>That was true. And while Harry felt like he was being railroaded
into something - no, that wasn't just a feeling, he <em>had</em>
been railroaded - he couldn't deny that saying those things, and
seeing Professor Quirrell's smile, <em>did</em> make him feel
better.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell reached into his robes, the gesture slow and
deliberately significant, and drew forth...</p>
<p>...a <em>book</em>.</p>
<p>It was different from any book Harry had ever seen, the edges
and corners visibly misshapen; <em>rough-hewn</em> was the phrase
that came to mind, like it had been hacked out of a book mine.</p>
<p>"What is it?" breathed Harry.</p>
<p>"A diary," said Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>"Whose?"</p>
<p>"That of a famous person." Professor Quirrell was smiling
broadly.</p>
<p>"Okay..."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's expression became more serious. "Mr.
Potter, one of the requisites for becoming a powerful wizard is an
excellent memory. The key to a puzzle is often something you read
twenty years ago in an old scroll, or a peculiar ring you saw on
the finger of a man you met only once. I mention this to explain
how I managed to remember this item, and the placard attached to
it, after meeting you a good deal later. You see, Mr. Potter, over
the course of my life, I have viewed a number of private
collections held by individuals who are, perhaps, not quite
deserving of all that they have -"</p>
<p>"You <em>stole</em> it?" Harry said incredulously.</p>
<p>"That is correct," said Professor Quirrell. "Very recently, in
fact. I think you will appreciate this particular item much more
than the vile little man who held it for no other purpose than
impressing his equally vile friends with its rarity."</p>
<p>Harry was simply gaping now.</p>
<p>"But if you feel that my actions were incorrect, Mr. Potter, I
suppose you needn't accept your special present. Though of course I
shan't go to the trouble of stealing it <em>back</em>. So which is
it to be?"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell tossed the book from one hand to another,
causing Harry to reach out involuntarily with a look of dismay.</p>
<p>"Oh," said Professor Quirrell, "don't worry about a little rough
handling. You could toss this diary in a fireplace and it would
emerge unscathed. In any case, I await your decision."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell casually threw the book up into the air and
caught it again, grinning.</p>
<p><em>No,</em> said Gryffindor and Hufflepuff.</p>
<p><em>Yes</em>, said Ravenclaw. <em>What part of the word 'book'
did you two not understand?</em></p>
<p><em>The theft part,</em> said Hufflepuff.</p>
<p><em>Oh, come on,</em> said Ravenclaw, <em>you can't seriously
ask us to say no and spend the rest of our life wondering what it
was.</em></p>
<p><em>It sounds like a net positive from a utilitarian
standpoint,</em> said Slytherin. <em>Think of it as an economic
transaction which generates gains from trade, only without the
trade part.</em> <em>Plus,</em> we <em>didn't steal it and it won't
help anyone to have Professor Quirrell keep it.</em></p>
<p><em>He's trying to turn you Dark!</em> shrieked Gryffindor, and
Hufflepuff nodded firmly.</p>
<p><em>Don't be a naive little boy,</em> said Slytherin, <em>he's
trying to teach you Slytherin.</em></p>
<p><em>Yeah,</em> said Ravenclaw. <em>Whoever owned the book
originally was probably a Death Eater or something. It belongs with
us.<br></em></p>
<p>Harry's mouth opened, then halted that way, an agonized look on
his face.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell seemed to be quite enjoying himself. He had
balanced the book on its corner, on one finger, and was keeping it
upright while humming a little tune.</p>
<p>There came a knock at the door.</p>
<p>The book vanished back into Professor Quirrell's robes, and he
rose up from his chair. Professor Quirrell started to walk over to
the door -</p>
<p>- and staggered, suddenly lurching into the wall.</p>
<p>"It's all right," said Professor Quirrell's voice, which
suddenly sounded a lot weaker than usual. "Sit down, Mr. Potter,
it's just a dizzy spell. Sit down."</p>
<p>Harry's fingers gripped the edge of his chair, uncertain as to
what he should do, what he <em>could</em> do. Harry couldn't even
get too close to Professor Quirrell, not unless he wanted to defy
that sense of Doom -</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell straightened, then, his breathing seeming a
bit heavy, and opened the door.</p>
<p>The waitress came in, bearing a platter of food; and as she
distributed the plates, Professor Quirrell walked slowly back to
the table.</p>
<p>But by the time the waitress had bowed her way out, Professor
Quirrell was sitting upright and smiling again.</p>
<p>Still, the brief episode of whatever-it-was had decided Harry.
He couldn't say no, not after Professor Quirrell had gone to that
much trouble.</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell held up a cautioning finger, then took out
his wand again, locked the door again, and repeated three of the
same Charms from earlier.</p>
<p>Then Professor Quirrell took the book back out of his robes and
tossed it to Harry, who almost dropped it into his soup.</p>
<p>Harry shot Professor Quirrell a look of helpless indignation.
You weren't supposed to <em>do</em> that with books, enchanted or
not.</p>
<p>Harry opened the book with ingrained, instinctive care. The
pages seemed too thick, with a texture unlike either Muggle paper
or wizarding parchment. And the contents were...</p>
<p>...blank?</p>
<p>"Am I supposed to be seeing -"</p>
<p>"Look nearer the beginning," said Professor Quirrell, and Harry
(again with that helpless, ingrained care) turned a block of pages
back.</p>
<p>The lettering was obviously handwritten, and very hard to read,
but Harry thought the words might be Latin.</p>
<p>"What <em>is</em> this?" said Harry.</p>
<p>"That," said Professor Quirrell, "is a record of the magical
researches of a Muggleborn who never came to Hogwarts. He refused
his letter, and conducted his own small investigations, which never
did get very far without a wand. From the description on the
placard, I expect that his name bears rather more significance to
you than to me. That, Harry Potter, is the diary of Roger
Bacon."</p>
<p>Harry almost fainted.</p>
<p>Nestled up against the wall, where Professor Quirrell had
stumbled, glistened the crushed remains of a beautiful blue
beetle.</p>

<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"And then Janet was a Squib," said the portrait of a short young
woman with a gold-trimmed hat.</p>
<p>Draco wrote it down. That was only twenty-eight but it was time
to go back and meet Harry.</p>
<p>He'd needed to ask other portraits to help translating, English
had changed a lot, but the oldest portraits had described
first-year spells that sounded an awful lot like the ones they had
now. Draco had recognized around half of them and the other half
didn't sound any more powerful.</p>
<p>The sick feeling in his stomach had grown with each answer until
finally, unable to take it any more, he'd gone off and asked other
portraits Harry Potter's strange question about Squib marriages,
instead. The first five portraits hadn't known anyone and finally
he'd asked those portraits to ask <em>their</em> acquaintances to
ask <em>their</em> acquaintances and so managed to find some people
who'd actually admit to being friends with Squibs.</p>
<p>(The first-year Slytherin had explained he was working on an
important project with a Ravenclaw and the Ravenclaw had told him
they needed this information and then run off without saying why.
This had garnered many sympathetic looks.)</p>
<p>Draco's feet were heavy as he walked through the corridors of
Hogwarts. He should have been running but he couldn't seem to
muster the energy. He kept on thinking that he didn't want to know
about this, he didn't want to be involved in any of this, he didn't
want this to be his responsibility, just let Harry Potter do it, if
magic was fading let Harry Potter take care of it...</p>
<p>But Draco knew that wasn't right.</p>
<p>Chill the dungeons of Slytherin, gray the stone walls, Draco
usually liked the atmosphere, but now it seemed too much like
fading.</p>
<p>His hand on the doorknob, Harry Potter already inside and
waiting, wearing his cowled cloak.</p>
<p>"The ancient first-year spells," Harry Potter said. "What did
you find?"</p>
<p>"They're no more powerful than the spells we use now."</p>
<p>Harry Potter's fist struck a desk, hard. "Damn it. All right. My
own experiment was a failure, Draco. There's something called the
Interdict of Merlin -"</p>
<p>Draco hit himself on the forehead, realizing.</p>
<p>"- which stops anyone from getting knowledge of powerful spells
out of books, even if you find and read a powerful wizard's notes
they won't make sense to you, it has to go from one living mind to
another. I couldn't find any powerful spells that we had the
instructions for but couldn't cast. But if you can't get them out
of old books, why would anyone bother passing them on by word of
mouth after they stopped working? Did you get the data on the Squib
couples?"</p>
<p>Draco started to hand the parchment over -</p>
<p>But Harry Potter held up a hand. "Law of science, Draco. First I
tell you the theory and the prediction. Then you show me the data.
That way you know I'm not just making up a theory to fit; you know
that the theory actually predicted the data in <em>advance.</em> I
have to explain this to you anyway, so I have to explain it
<em>before</em> you show me the data. That's the rule. So put on
your cloak and let's sit down."</p>
<p>Harry Potter sat down at a desk with torn scraps of paper
arranged across its surface. Draco drew his cloak out of his
bookbag, drew it on, and sat down across from Harry on the other
side, giving the paper scraps a puzzled look. They were arranged in
two rows and the rows were about twenty scraps long.</p>
<p>"The secret of blood," said Harry Potter, an intense look on his
face, "is something called deoxyribonucleic acid. You don't say
that name in front of anyone who's not a scientist.
Deoxyribonucleic acid is the recipe that tells your body how to
grow, two legs, two arms, short or tall, whether you have brown
eyes or green. It's a material thing, you can <em>see</em> it if
you have microscopes, which are like telescopes only they look at
things that are very small instead of very far away. And that
recipe has two copies of everything, always, in case one copy is
broken. Imagine two long rows of pieces of paper. At each place in
the row, there are two pieces of paper, and when you have children,
your body selects one piece of paper at random from each place in
the row, and the mother's body will do the same, and so the child
also gets two pieces of paper at each place in the row. Two copies
of everything, one from your mother, one from your father, and when
you have children they get one piece of paper from you at random in
each place."</p>
<p>As Harry spoke, his fingers ranged over the paired scraps of
paper, pointing to one part of the pair when he said "from your
mother", the other when he said "from your father". And as Harry
talked about picking a piece of paper at random, his hand pulled a
Knut out of his robes and flipped it; Harry looked at the coin, and
then pointed to the top piece of paper. All without a pause in the
speech.</p>
<p>"Now when it comes to something like being short or tall,
there's a <em>lot</em> of places in the recipe that make
<em>little</em> differences. So if a tall father marries a short
mother, the child gets some pieces of paper saying 'tall' and some
pieces of paper saying 'short', and usually the child ends up
middle-sized. But not always. By luck, the child might get a lot of
pieces saying 'tall', and not many papers saying 'short', and grow
up pretty tall. You could have a tall father with five papers
saying 'tall' and a tall mother with five papers saying 'tall' and
by amazing luck the child gets <em>all ten</em> papers saying
'tall' and ends up taller than both of them. You see? Blood isn't a
perfect fluid, it doesn't mix perfectly. Deoxyribonucleic acid is
made up of lots of little pieces, like a glass of pebbles instead
of a glass of water. That's why a child isn't always exactly in the
middle of the parents."</p>
<p>Draco listened with his mouth open. How in Merlin's name had the
Muggles figured all this out? They could <em>see</em> the
recipe?</p>
<p>"Now," Harry Potter said, "suppose that, just like with
tallness, there's lots of little places in the recipe where you can
have a piece of paper that says 'magic' or 'not magic'. If you have
enough pieces of paper saying 'magic' you're a wizard, if you have
a <em>lot</em> of pieces of paper you're a powerful wizard, if you
have too few you're a Muggle, and in between you're a Squib. Then,
when two Squibs marry, most of the time the children should also be
Squibs, but once in a while a child will get lucky and get most of
the father's magic papers <em>and</em> most of the mother's magic
papers, and be strong enough to be a wizard. But probably not a
very powerful one. If you started out with a lot of powerful
wizards and they married only each other, they would stay powerful.
But if they started marrying Muggleborns who were just barely
magical, or Squibs... you see? The blood wouldn't mix perfectly, it
would be a glass of pebbles, not a glass of water, because that's
just the way blood works. There would still be powerful wizards now
and then, when they got a lot of magic papers by luck. But they
wouldn't be as powerful as the most powerful wizards from
earlier."</p>
<p>Draco nodded slowly. He'd never heard it explained that way
before. There was a surprising beauty to how exactly it fit.</p>
<p>"<em>But,</em>" Harry said. "That's only <em>one</em>
hypothesis. Suppose that instead there's only a <em>single</em>
place in the recipe that makes you a wizard. Only <em>one</em>
place where a piece of paper can say 'magic' or 'not magic'. And
there are two copies of everything, always. So then there are only
three possibilities. Both copies can say 'magic'. One copy can say
'magic' and one copy can say 'not magic'. Or both copies can say
'not magic'. Wizards, Squibs, and Muggles. Two copies and you can
cast spells, one copy and you can still use potions or magic
devices, and zero copies means you might even have trouble looking
straight at magic. Muggleborns wouldn't really be born to Muggles,
they would be born to two Squibs, two parents each with one magic
copy who'd grown up in the Muggle world. Now imagine a witch
marries a Squib. Each child will get one paper saying 'magic' from
the mother, always, it doesn't matter which piece gets picked at
random, both say 'magic'. But like flipping a coin, half the time
the child will get a paper saying 'magic' from the father, and half
the time the child will get the father's paper saying 'not magic'.
When a witch marries a Squib, the result won't be a lot of weak
wizarding children. Half the children will be wizards and witches
just as powerful as their mother, and half the children will be
Squibs. Because if there's just <em>one</em> place in the recipe
that makes you a wizard, then magic isn't like a glass of pebbles
that can mix. It's like a single magical pebble, a sorcerer's
stone."</p>
<p>Harry arranged three pairs of papers side by side. On one pair
he wrote 'magic' and 'magic'. On another pair he wrote 'magic' on
the top paper only. And the third pair he left blank.</p>
<p>"In which case," Harry said, "either you have two stones or you
don't. Either you're a wizard or not. Powerful wizards would get
that way by studying harder and practicing more. And if wizards get
<em>inherently</em> less powerful, not because of spells being lost
but because people can't cast them... then maybe they're eating the
wrong foods or something. But if it's gotten steadily worse over
eight hundred years, then that could mean magic itself is fading
out of the world."</p>
<p>Harry arranged another two pairs of papers side by side, and
took out a quill. Soon each pair had one piece of paper saying
'magic' and the other paper blank.</p>
<p>"And that brings me to the prediction," said Harry. "What
happens when two Squibs marry. Flip a coin twice. It can come up
heads and heads, heads and tails, tails and heads, or tails and
tails. So one quarter of the time you'll get two heads, one quarter
of the time you'll get two tails, and half the time you'll get one
heads and one tail. Same thing if two Squibs marry. One quarter of
the children would come up magic and magic, and be wizards. One
quarter would come up not-magic and not-magic, and be Muggles. The
other half would be Squibs. It's a very old and very classic
pattern. It was discovered by Gregor Mendel who is not forgotten,
and it was the first hint ever uncovered for how the recipe worked.
Anyone who knows anything about blood science would recognize that
pattern in an instant. It wouldn't be exact, any more than if you
flip a coin twice forty times you'll always get exactly ten pairs
of two heads. But if it's seven or thirteen wizards out of forty
children that'll be a strong indicator. That's the test I had you
do. Now let's see your data."</p>
<p>And before Draco could even think, Harry Potter had taken the
parchment out of Draco's hand.</p>
<p>Draco's throat was very dry.</p>
<p>Twenty-eight children.</p>
<p>He wasn't sure of the exact number but he was pretty sure around
a fourth had been wizards.</p>
<p>"Six wizards out of twenty-eight children," Harry Potter said
after a moment. "Well, that's that, then. And first-years were
casting the same spells at the same power level eight centuries
ago, too. Your test and my test both came out the same way."</p>
<p>There was a long silence in the classroom.</p>
<p>"What now?" Draco whispered.</p>
<p>He'd never been so terrified.</p>
<p>"It's not definite yet," said Harry Potter. "My experiment
failed, remember? I need you to design another test, Draco."</p>
<p>"I, I..." Draco said. His voice was breaking. "I can't do this
Harry, it's too much for me."</p>
<p>Harry's look was fierce. "Yes you can, because you have to. I
thought about it myself, too, after I found out about the Interdict
of Merlin. Draco, is there any way of observing the strength of
magic directly? Some way that doesn't have anything to do with
wizards' blood or the spells we learn?"</p>
<p>Draco's mind was just blank.</p>
<p>"Anything that affects magic affects wizards," said Harry. "But
then we can't tell if it's the wizards or the magic. What does
magic affect that <em>isn't</em> a wizard?"</p>
<p>"Magical creatures, obviously," said Draco without even thinking
about it.</p>
<p>Harry Potter slowly smiled. "Draco, that's
<em>brilliant.</em>"</p>
<p><em>It's the sort of dumb question you'd only ask in the first
place if you'd been raised by Muggles.</em></p>
<p>Then the sickness in Draco's stomach got even worse as he
realized what it would mean if magical creatures <em>were</em>
getting weaker. They would know for certain then that magic was
fading, and there was a part of Draco that was already sure that
was exactly what they would find. He didn't want to see this, he
didn't want to know...</p>
<p>Harry Potter was already halfway to the door. "Come <em>on</em>,
Draco! There's a portrait not far from here, we'll just ask them to
go get someone old and find out right away! We're cloaked, if
someone sees us we can just run away! Let's go!"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>It didn't take long after that.</p>
<p>It was a wide portrait, but the three people in it were looking
rather crowded. There was a middle-aged man from the twelfth
century, dressed in black swathes of cloth; who spoke to a
sad-looking young woman from the fourteenth century, with hair that
seemed to constantly frizz about her head as if she'd been charged
up by a static spell; and she spoke to a dignified, wizened old man
from the seventeenth century with a solid gold bowtie; and him they
could understand.</p>
<p>They had asked about Dementors.</p>
<p>They had asked about phoenixes.</p>
<p>They had asked about dragons and trolls and house elves.</p>
<p>Harry had frowned, pointed out that creatures which needed the
most magic could just be dying out entirely, and had asked for the
most powerful magical creatures known.</p>
<p>There wasn't anything unfamiliar on the list, except for a
species of Dark creature called mind flayers which the translator
noted had finally been exterminated by Harold Shea, and those
didn't sound half as scary as Dementors.</p>
<p>Magical creatures were as powerful now as they'd ever been,
apparently.</p>
<p>The sickness in Draco's stomach was easing, and now he just felt
confused.</p>
<p>"Harry," Draco said in the middle of the old man translating a
list of all eleven powers of a beholder's eyes, "what does this
mean?"</p>
<p>Harry held up a finger and the old man finished the list.</p>
<p>Then Harry thanked all the portraits for helping - Draco, pretty
much on automatic, did so as well and more graciously - and they
headed back to the classroom.</p>
<p>And Harry brought out the original parchment with the
hypotheses, and began scribbling.</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Observation:</span></em></p>
<p><em>Wizardry isn't as powerful now as it was when Hogwarts was
founded.</em></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Hypotheses:</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">1</span></em><em>.
Magic itself is fading.<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">2</span></em><em>. Wizards
are interbreeding with Muggles and Squibs.<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">3</span></em><em>.
Knowledge to cast powerful spells is being lost.<br>
4. Wizards are eating the wrong foods as children, or something
else besides blood is making them grow up weaker.<br>
5. Muggle technology is interfering with magic. (Since 800 years
ago?)<br>
6. Stronger wizards are having fewer children. (Draco = only child?
Check if 3 powerful wizards, Quirrell / Dumbledore / Dark Lord, had
any children.)</em></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Tests:</span></em></p>
<p><em>A. Are there spells we know but can't cast (1 or 2) or are
the lost spells no longer known (3)? <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Result</span>: Inconclusive due to
Interdict of Merlin. No known uncastable spell, but could simply
have not been passed on.</em></p>
<p><em>B. Did ancient first-year students cast the same sort of
spells, with the same power, as now? (Weak evidence for 1 over 2,
but blood could also be losing powerful wizardry only.)
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Result</span>: Same level
of first-year spells then as now.</em></p>
<p><em>C. Additional test that distinguishes 1 and 2 using
scientific knowledge of blood, will explain later. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Result</span>: There's only one place
in the recipe that makes you a wizard, and either you have two
papers saying 'magic' or you don't.</em></p>
<p><em>D. Are magical creatures losing their powers? Distinguishes
1 from (2 or 3). <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Result:</span> Magical creatures seem
to be as strong as they ever were.</em></p>
<p>"A failed," said Harry Potter. "B is weak evidence for 1 over 2.
C falsifies 2. D falsifies 1. 4 was unlikely and B argues against 4
as well. 5 was unlikely and D argues against it. 6 is falsified
along with 2. That leaves 3. Interdict of Merlin or not, I didn't
actually find any known spell that couldn't be cast. So when you
add it all up, it looks like knowledge is being lost."</p>
<p>And the trap snapped shut.</p>
<p>As soon as the panic went away, as soon as Draco understood that
magic <em>wasn't</em> fading out, it took all of five seconds to
realize.</p>
<p>Draco shoved himself away from the desk and stood up so hard
that his chair skittered with a scraping noise across the floor and
fell over.</p>
<p>"So it was all just a stupid trick, then."</p>
<p>Harry Potter stared at him for a moment, still sitting. When he
spoke, his voice was quiet. "It was a fair test, Draco. If it had
come out a different way, I would have accepted it. That's not
something I would ever cheat on. Ever. I didn't look at your data
before I made my predictions. I told you up front when the
Interdict of Merlin invalidated the first experiment -"</p>
<p>"Oh," Draco said, the anger starting to come out into his voice,
"you didn't know how the whole thing was going to come out?"</p>
<p>"I didn't <em>know</em> anything you didn't know," Harry said,
still quietly. "I admit that I suspected. Hermione Granger was too
powerful, she should have been barely magical and she wasn't, how
can a Muggleborn be the best spellcaster in Hogwarts? And she's
getting the best grades on her essays too, it's too much
coincidence for one girl to be the strongest magically <em>and</em>
academically unless there's a single cause. Hermione Granger's
existence pointed to there being only one thing that makes you a
wizard, something you either have or you don't, and the power
differences coming from how much we know and how much we practice.
And there weren't different classes for purebloods and Muggleborns,
and so on. There were too many ways the world didn't look the way
it would look if you were right. But Draco, I didn't see anything
you couldn't see too. I didn't perform any tests I didn't tell you
about. I didn't cheat, Draco. I wanted us to work out the answer
together. And I never thought that magic might be fading out of the
world until you said it. It was a scary idea for me, too."</p>
<p>"Whatever," Draco said. He was working very hard to control his
voice and not just start screaming at Harry. "You claim you're not
going to run off and tell anyone else about this."</p>
<p>"Not without consulting you first," Harry said. He opened his
hands in a pleading gesture. "Draco, I'm being as nice as I can but
<em>the world turned out to just not be that way</em>."</p>
<p>"Fine. Then you and I are through. I'm going to just walk away
and forget any of this ever happened."</p>
<p>Draco spun around, feeling the burning sensation in his throat,
the sense of betrayal, and that was when he realized he really
<em>had</em> liked Harry Potter, and that thought didn't slow him
down for a moment as he strode toward the classroom door.</p>
<p>And Harry Potter's voice came, now louder, and worried:</p>
<p>"Draco... you <em>can't</em> forget. Don't you understand? That
was your sacrifice."</p>
<p>Draco stopped in midstride and turned around. "<em>What</em> are
you talking about?"</p>
<p>But there was already a freezing coldness in Draco's spine.</p>
<p>He knew even before Harry Potter said it.</p>
<p>"To become a scientist. You questioned one of your beliefs, not
just a small belief but something that had great significance to
you. You did experiments, gathered data, and the outcome proved the
belief was wrong. You saw the results and understood what they
meant." Harry Potter's voice was faltering. "Remember, Draco, you
can't sacrifice a <em>true</em> belief that way, because the
experiments will confirm it instead of falsifying it. Your
sacrifice to become a scientist was your <em>false</em> belief that
wizard blood was mixing and getting weaker."</p>
<p>"<em>That's not true!</em> " said Draco. "I didn't sacrifice the
belief. I still believe that!" His voice was getting louder, and
the chill was getting worse.</p>
<p>Harry Potter shook his head. His voice came in a whisper.
"Draco... I'm sorry, Draco, you <em>don't</em> believe it, not
anymore." Harry's voice rose again. "I'll prove it to you. Imagine
that someone tells you they're keeping a dragon in their house. You
tell them you want to see it. They say it's an invisible dragon.
You say fine, you'll listen to it move. They say it's an inaudible
dragon. You say you'll throw some cooking flour into the air and
see the outline of the dragon. They say the dragon is permeable to
flour. And the telling thing is that they know, in
<em>advance,</em> exactly which experimental results they'll have
to explain away. They <em>know</em> everything will come out the
way it does if there's no dragon, they know in <em>advance</em>
just which excuses they'll have to make. So maybe they <em>say</em>
there's a dragon. Maybe they <em>believe</em> they believe there's
a dragon, it's called belief-in-belief. But they don't actually
believe it. You can be mistaken about what you believe, most people
never realize there's a difference between believing something and
thinking it's good to believe it." Harry Potter had risen from the
desk now, and taken a few steps toward Draco. "And Draco, you don't
believe any more in blood purism, I'll show you that you don't. If
blood purism is true, then Hermione Granger doesn't make sense, so
what could explain her? Maybe she's a wizarding orphan raised by
Muggles, just like I was? I could go to Granger and ask to see
pictures of her parents, to see if she looks like them. Would you
expect her to look different? Should we go perform that test?"</p>
<p>"They would have put her with relatives," Draco said, his voice
trembling. "They'll still look the same."</p>
<p>"You see. You already know what experimental result you'll have
to excuse. If you still believed in blood purism you would say,
sure, let's go take a look, I bet she won't look like her parents,
she's too powerful to be a real Muggleborn -"</p>
<p>"They <em>would</em> have put her with relatives!"</p>
<p>"Scientists can do tests to check for sure if someone is the
true child of a father. Granger would probably do it if I paid her
family enough. <em>She</em> wouldn't be afraid of the results. So
what do you expect that test to show? Tell me to run it and we
will. But you already know what the test will say. You'll always
know. You won't ever be able to forget. You might <em>wish</em> you
believed in blood purism, but you'll always <em>expect to see
happen</em> just exactly what would happen if there was only one
thing that made you a wizard. That was your sacrifice to become a
scientist."</p>
<p>Draco's breathing was ragged. "Do you realize <em>what you've
done?</em> " Draco surged forward and he seized Harry by the collar
of his robes. His voice rose to a scream, it sounded unbearably
loud in the closed classroom and the silence. "<em>Do you realize
what you've done?</em> "</p>
<p>Harry's voice was shaky. "You had a belief. The belief was
false. I helped you see that. What's true is already so, owning up
to it doesn't make it worse -"</p>
<p>The fingers on Draco's right hand clenched into a fist and that
hand dropped down and blasted up unstoppably and punched Harry
Potter in the jaw so hard that his body went crashing back into a
desk and then to the floor.</p>
<p>"<em>Idiot!</em> " screamed Draco. "<em>Idiot! Idiot!</em> "</p>
<p>"Draco," whispered Harry from the floor, "Draco, I'm sorry, I
didn't think this would happen for months, I didn't expect you to
awaken as a scientist this quickly, I thought I would have longer
to prepare you, teach you the techniques that make it hurt less to
admit you're wrong -"</p>
<p>"What about Father?" Draco said. His voice trembled with rage.
"Were you going to prepare <em>him</em> or did you just not
<em>care</em> what happened after this?"</p>
<p>"You can't tell <em>him!</em> " Harry said, his voice rising in
alarm. "He's not a scientist! You promised, Draco!"</p>
<p>For a moment the thought of Father not knowing came as a
relief.</p>
<p>And then the real anger started to rise.</p>
<p>"So you planned for me to lie to him and tell him I still
believe," Draco said, voice shaking. "I'll always have to lie to
him, and now when I grow up I can't be a Death Eater, and I won't
even be able to tell him why not."</p>
<p>"If your father really loves you," whispered Harry from the
floor, "he'll still love you even if you don't become a Death
Eater, and it sounds like your father <em>does</em> really love
you, Draco -"</p>
<p>"<em>Your</em> stepfather is a scientist," Draco said. The words
coming out like biting knives. "If <em>you</em> weren't going to be
a scientist, he would still love you. But you'd be a <em>little
less special</em> to him."</p>
<p>Harry flinched. The boy opened his mouth, as if to say 'I'm
sorry', and then closed his mouth, seeming to think better of it,
which was either very smart of him or very lucky, because Draco
might have tried to kill him.</p>
<p>"You should have warned me," Draco said. His voice rose.
"<em>You should have warned me!</em> "</p>
<p>"I... I did... every time I told you about the power, I told you
about the price. I said, you have to admit you're wrong. I said
this would be the hardest path for you. That this was the sacrifice
anyone had to make to become a scientist. I said, what if the
experiment says one thing and your family and friends say another
-"</p>
<p>"<em>You call that a warning?</em> " Draco was screaming now.
"<em>You call that a warning? When we're doing a ritual that calls
for a permanent sacrifice?</em> "</p>
<p>"I... I..." The boy on the floor swallowed. "I guess maybe it
wasn't clear. I'm sorry. But that which can be destroyed by the
truth should be."</p>
<p>Hitting him wasn't enough.</p>
<p>"You're wrong about one thing," Draco said, his voice deadly.
"Granger isn't the strongest student in Hogwarts. She just gets the
best grades in class. You're about to find out the difference."</p>
<p>Sudden shock showed in Harry's face, and he tried to roll
quickly to his feet -</p>
<p>It was already too late for him.</p>
<p>"<em>Expelliarmus!</em> "</p>
<p>Harry's wand flew across the room.</p>
<p>"<em>Gom jabbar!</em> "</p>
<p>A pulse of inky blackness struck Harry's left hand.</p>
<p>"That's a torture spell," said Draco. "It's for getting
information out of people. I'm just going to leave it on you and
lock the door behind me when I go. Maybe I'll set the locking spell
to wear off after a few hours. Maybe it won't wear off until you
die in here. Have fun."</p>
<p>Draco moved smoothly backward, wand still on Harry. Draco's hand
dipped down, picked up his bookbag, without his aim wavering.</p>
<p>The pain was already showing in Harry Potter's face as he spoke.
"Malfoys are above the underage magic laws, I take it? It's not
because your blood is stronger. It's because you already practiced.
In the beginning you were as weak as any of us. Is my prediction
wrong?"</p>
<p>Draco's hand whitened on his wand, but his aim stayed
steady.</p>
<p>"Just so you know," Harry said through gritted teeth, "if you'd
told me I was wrong I would have listened. <em>I</em> won't ever
torture <em>you</em> when you show me that I'm wrong. And you
<em>will</em>. Someday. You're awakened as a scientist now, and
even if you never learn to use your power, you'll always," Harry
gasped, "be looking, for ways, to test, your beliefs -"</p>
<p>Draco's backing away was less smooth, now, a little faster, and
he had to work to keep his wand on Harry as he reached back to open
the door and stepped back out of the classroom.</p>
<p>Then Draco shut the door again.</p>
<p>He cast the most powerful locking Charm he knew.</p>
<p>Draco waited until he heard Harry's first scream before casting
the <em>Quietus.</em></p>
<p>And then he walked away.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"<em>Aaahhhhh! Finite Incantatem! Aaaahhh!</em> "</p>
<p>Harry's left hand had been put into a pot of boiling cooking oil
and left there. He'd put everything he had into the <em>Finite
Incantatem</em> and it still wasn't working.</p>
<p>Some hexes required specific counters or you couldn't undo them,
or maybe it was just that Draco was that much stronger.</p>
<p>"<em>Aaaaahhhh!</em> "</p>
<p>Harry's hand was really starting to hurt, now, and that was
interfering with his attempts to think creatively.</p>
<p>But a few screams later, Harry realized what he had to do.</p>
<p>His pouch, unfortunately, was on the wrong side of his body, and
it took some twisting to reach into it, especially with his other
arm flailing around in a reflex, unstoppable attempt to fling off
the source of pain. By the time he managed it his other arm had
managed to throw away his wand again.</p>
<p>"Medical <em>ahhhhh</em> kit! Medical kit!"</p>
<p>On the floor, the green light was too dim to see by.</p>
<p>Harry couldn't stand. He couldn't crawl. He rolled across the
floor to where he thought his wand was, and it wasn't there, and
with one hand he managed to raise himself high enough to see his
wand, and he rolled there, and got the wand, and rolled back to
where the medical kit was opened. There was also a good deal of
screaming, and a bit of throwing up.</p>
<p>It took eight tries before Harry could cast <em>Lumos.</em></p>
<p>And then, well, the package wasn't designed to be opened
one-handed, because all wizards were idiots, that was why. Harry
had to use his teeth and so it took a while before Harry finally
managed to wrap the Numbcloth over his left hand.</p>
<p>When all feeling in his left hand was finally gone, Harry let
his mind come apart, and lay motionless on the floor, and cried for
a while.</p>
<p><em>Well,</em> Harry's mind said silently into itself, when it
had recovered enough to think in words again. <em>Was it worth
it?</em></p>
<p>Slowly, Harry's functional hand reached up to a desk.</p>
<p>Harry pulled himself to his feet.</p>
<p>Took a deep breath.</p>
<p>Exhaled.</p>
<p>Smiled.</p>
<p>It wasn't much of a smile, but it was a smile nonetheless.</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Professor Quirrell, I couldn't have lost without
you.</em></p>
<p>He hadn't redeemed Draco yet, not even close. Contrary to what
Draco himself might now believe, Draco was still the child of a
Death Eater, through and through. Still a boy who'd grown up
thinking "rape" was something the cool older kids did. But it was
one heck of a start.</p>
<p>Harry couldn't claim it had all gone just as planned. It had all
gone just as completely made up on the spot. The <em>plan</em>
hadn't called for this to happen until December or thereabouts,
after Harry had taught Draco the techniques not to deny the
evidence when he saw it.</p>
<p>But he'd seen the look of fear on Draco's face, realized that
Draco was <em>already</em> taking an alternative hypothesis
seriously, and seized the moment. One case of true curiosity had
the same sort of redeeming power in rationality that one case of
true love had in movies.</p>
<p>In retrospect, Harry had given himself hours to make the most
important discovery in the history of magic, and months to break
through the undeveloped mental barriers of an eleven-year-old boy.
This could indicate that Harry had some sort of major cognitive
deficit with respect to estimating task completion times.</p>
<p>Was Harry going to Science Hell for what he'd done? Harry wasn't
sure. He'd contrived to keep Draco's mind on the possibility that
magic was fading, made sure Draco would carry out the part of the
experiment that would seem at first to point in that direction.
He'd waited until after explaining genetics to prompt Draco into
realizing about magical creatures (though Harry had thought in
terms of ancient artifacts like the Sorting Hat, which no one could
duplicate anymore, but which continued to function). But Harry
hadn't actually exaggerated any evidence, hadn't distorted the
meaning of any results. When the Interdict of Merlin had
invalidated the test that should have been definitive, he'd told
Draco up front.</p>
<p>And then there was the part <em>after</em> that...</p>
<p>But he hadn't actually <em>lied</em> to Draco. Draco had
believed it, and <em>that would make it true.</em></p>
<p>The end, admittedly, had not been fun.</p>
<p>Harry turned, and staggered toward the door.</p>
<p>Time to test Draco's locking spell.</p>
<p>The first step was simply trying to turn the doorknob. Draco
could have been bluffing.</p>
<p>Draco hadn't been bluffing.</p>
<p>"<em>Finite Incantatem.</em>" Harry's voice came out rather
hoarse, and he could feel that the spell hadn't taken.</p>
<p>So Harry tried it again, and that time it felt true. But another
twist at the doorknob showed it hadn't worked. No surprise
there.</p>
<p>Time to bring out the big guns. Harry drew a deep breath. This
spell was one of the most powerful he'd learned so far.</p>
<p>"<em>Alohomora!</em> "</p>
<p>Harry staggered a little after saying it.</p>
<p>And the classroom door still didn't open.</p>
<p>That shocked Harry. Harry hadn't been planning to go anywhere
near Dumbledore's forbidden corridor, of course. But a spell to
open magical locks had seemed like a useful sort of spell anyway,
and so Harry had learned it. Was Dumbledore's forbidden corridor
meant to lure people so stupid that they didn't notice the security
was worse than what Draco Malfoy could put on it?</p>
<p>Fear was creeping back into Harry's system. The placard in the
medical kit had said the Numbcloth could only safely be used for up
to thirty minutes. After that it would come off automatically, and
not be reusable for 24 hours. Right now it was 6:51pm. He'd put on
the Numbcloth about five minutes ago.</p>
<p>So Harry took a step back, and considered the door. It was a
solid panel of dark oaken wood, interrupted only by the brass metal
doorknob.</p>
<p>Harry didn't know any explosive or cutting or smashing spells,
and Transfiguring explosive would have violated the rule against
Transfiguring things to be burned. Acid was a liquid and would have
made fumes...</p>
<p>But that was no obstacle to a <em>creative thinker.</em></p>
<p>Harry laid his wand against one of the door's brass hinges, and
concentrated on the form of cotton as a pure abstraction apart from
any material cotton, and also on the pure material apart from the
pattern that made it a brass hinge, and brought the two concepts
together, imposing shape on substance. An hour of Transfiguration
practice every day for a month had gotten Harry to the point where
he could Transfigure a subject of five cubic centimeters in just
under a minute.</p>
<p>After two minutes the hinge hadn't changed at all.</p>
<p>Whoever had designed Draco's locking spell, they'd thought of
that, too. Or the door was part of Hogwarts and the castle was
immune.</p>
<p>A glance showed the walls to be solid stone. So was the floor.
So was the ceiling. You couldn't separately Transfigure a part of
something that was a solid whole; Harry would have needed to try
Transfiguring the whole wall, which would have taken hours or maybe
days of continuous effort, if he could have done it at all, and if
the wall wasn't contiguous with the rest of the whole castle...</p>
<p>Harry's Time-Turner wouldn't open until 9pm. After that he could
go back to 6pm, before the door was locked.</p>
<p>How long would the torture spell last?</p>
<p>Harry swallowed hard. Tears were coming into his eyes again.</p>
<p>His brilliantly creative mind had just offered the ingenious
suggestion that Harry could cut his hand off using the hacksaw in
the toolset stored in his pouch, which would hurt, obviously, but
might hurt a lot less than Draco's pain spell, since the nerves
would be gone; and he had tourniquets in the healer's kit.</p>
<p>And that was obviously a hideously stupid idea that Harry would
regret the rest of his entire life.</p>
<p>But Harry didn't know if he could hold out for two hours under
torture.</p>
<p>He wanted <em>out</em> of this classroom, he wanted out of this
classroom <em>now,</em> he didn't want to wait in here screaming
for two hours until he could use the Time-Turner, he needed to
<em>get out</em> and find someone to get the torture spell off his
hand...</p>
<p><em>Think!</em> Harry screamed at his brain. <em>Think!
Think!</em></p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The Slytherin dorm was mostly empty. People were at dinner. For
some reason Draco himself wasn't feeling very hungry.</p>
<p>Draco closed the door to his private room, locked it, Charmed it
shut, Quieted it, sat down on his bed, and started to cry.</p>
<p>It wasn't fair.</p>
<p>It wasn't fair.</p>
<p>It was the first time Draco had ever really <em>lost</em>
before, Father had warned him that losing for real would hurt the
first time it happened, but he'd lost <em>so much</em>, it wasn't
fair, it wasn't fair for him to lose <em>everything</em> the very
first time he lost.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the dungeons, a boy Draco had actually liked was
screaming in pain. Draco had never hurt anyone he'd liked before.
Punishing people who deserved it was supposed to be fun, but this
just felt sick inside. Father hadn't warned him about that, and
Draco wondered if it was a hard lesson everyone had to learn when
they grew up, or if Draco was just weak.</p>
<p>Draco wished it were Pansy screaming. That would have felt
better.</p>
<p>And the worst part was knowing that it might have been a mistake
to hurt Harry Potter.</p>
<p>Who else was there for Draco now? Dumbledore? After what he'd
done? Draco would sooner have been burned alive.</p>
<p>Draco would have to go back to Harry Potter because there was
nowhere else for him to go. And if Harry Potter said he didn't want
him, then Draco would be nothing, just a pathetic little boy who
could never be a Death Eater, never join Dumbledore's faction,
never learn science.</p>
<p>The trap had been perfectly set, perfectly executed. Father had
warned Draco over and over that what you sacrificed to Dark rituals
couldn't be regained. But Father hadn't known that the accursed
Muggles had invented rituals that didn't need wands, rituals you
could be tricked into doing without knowing it, and that was only
one of the terrible secrets which scientists knew and which Harry
Potter had brought with him.</p>
<p>Draco started crying harder, then.</p>
<p>He didn't want this, he <em>didn't want this</em> but there was
no turning back. It was too late. He was already a scientist.</p>
<p>Draco knew he should go back and free Harry Potter and
apologize. It would have been the smart thing to do.</p>
<p>Instead Draco stayed in his bed and sobbed.</p>
<p>He'd already hurt Harry Potter. It might be the only time Draco
ever got to hurt him, and he would have to hold to that one memory
for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>Let him keep screaming.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry dropped the remnants of his hacksaw to the ground. The
brass hinges had proved impervious, not even scratched, and Harry
was beginning to suspect that even the desperation act of trying to
Transfigure acid or explosives would have failed to open this door.
On the plus side, the attempt had destroyed the hacksaw.</p>
<p>His watch said it was 7:02pm, with less than fifteen minutes
left, and Harry tried to remember if there were any other sharp
things in his pouch that needed destroying, and felt another fit of
tears welling up. If only, when his Time-Turner opened, he could go
back and <em>prevent</em> -</p>
<p>And that was when Harry realized he was being
<em>silly</em>.</p>
<p>It wasn't the first time he'd been locked in a room.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall had already told him the correct way to do
this.</p>
<p>...she'd also told him not to use the Time-Turner for this sort
of thing.</p>
<p>Would Professor McGonagall realize that this occasion really
<em>did</em> warrant a special exception? Or just take away the
Time-Turner entirely?</p>
<p>Harry gathered up all his things, all the evidence, into his
pouch. A <em>Scourgify</em> took care of the vomit on the floor,
though not the sweat that had soaked his robes. He left the
overturned desks overturned, it wasn't important enough to be worth
doing with one hand.</p>
<p>When he was done, Harry glanced down at his watch. 7:04pm.</p>
<p>And then Harry waited. Seconds passed, feeling like years.</p>
<p>At 7:07pm, the door opened.</p>
<p>Professor Flitwick's puff-bearded face looked rather concerned.
"Are you all right, Harry?" said the squeaky voice of Ravenclaw's
Head of House. "I got a note saying you'd been locked in here
-"</p>

<p>Whatever can go Rowling will go Rowling.</p>
<p>This should <em>again</em> go <em>without saying,</em> but views
expressed by Severus Snape are not necessarily those of the
author.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"Okay," Harry said, swallowing. "Okay, Hermione, it's enough,
you can stop."</p>
<p>The white sugar pill in front of Hermione still hadn't changed
shape or color at all, even though she was concentrating harder
than Harry had ever seen, her eyes squeezed shut, beads of sweat on
her forehead, hand trembling as it gripped the wand -</p>
<p>"Hermione, <em>stop!</em> It's not going to work, Hermione, I
don't think we can make things that don't exist yet!"</p>
<p>Slowly, Hermione's hand relaxed its grasp on the wand.</p>
<p>"I thought I felt it," she said in a bare whisper. "I thought I
felt it start to Transfigure, just for a second."</p>
<p>There was a lump in Harry's throat. "You were probably imagining
it. Hoping too hard."</p>
<p>"I probably was," she said. She looked like she wanted to
cry.</p>
<p>Slowly, Harry took his mechanical pencil in his hand, and
reached over to the sheet of paper with all the items crossed out,
and drew a line through the item that said 'ALZHEIMER'S CURE'.</p>
<p>They couldn't have fed anyone a Transfigured pill. But
Transfiguration, at least the kind they could do, didn't enchant
the targets - it wouldn't Transfigure a regular broomstick into a
flying one. So if Hermione had been able to make a pill at all, it
would have been a <em>nonmagical</em> pill, one that worked for
ordinary material reasons. They could have secretly made pills for
a Muggle science lab, let them <em>study</em> the pills and try to
reverse-engineer them before the Transfiguration wore off... no one
in either world would need to know that magic had been involved, it
would just be another scientific breakthrough...</p>
<p>It hadn't been the sort of thing a wizard would think of,
either. They didn't respect mere <em>patterns of atoms</em> that
much, they didn't think of unenchanted <em>material</em> things as
objects of power. If it wasn't magical, it wasn't interesting.</p>
<p>Earlier, Harry had <em>very</em> secretly - he hadn't even told
Hermione - tried to Transfigure nanotechnology a la Eric Drexler.
(He'd tried to produce a desktop nanofactory, of course, not tiny
self-replicating assemblers, Harry wasn't insane.) It would have
been godhood in a single shot if it'd worked.</p>
<p>"That was it for today, right?" said Hermione. She was slumped
back in her chair, leaning her head against the back; and her face
showed her tiredness, which was very unusual for Hermione. She
liked to pretend she was limitless, at least when Harry was
around.</p>
<p>"One more," Harry said cautiously, "but that one's small, plus
it might actually work. I saved it for last because I was hoping we
could end on an up note. It's real stuff, not like phasers. They've
already made it in the laboratory, not like the Alzheimer's cure.
And it's a generic substance, not specific like the lost books you
tried to Transfigure copies of. I made a diagram of the molecular
structure to show you. We just want to make it <em>longer</em> than
it's ever been made before, and with all the tubes aligned, and the
endpoints embedded in diamond." Harry produced a sheet of graph
paper.</p>
<p>Hermione sat back up, took it, and studied it, frowning. "These
are <em>all</em> carbon atoms? And Harry, what's the name? I can't
Transfigure it if I don't know what it's called."</p>
<p>Harry made a disgusted face. He was still having trouble getting
used to that sort of thing, it shouldn't matter what something was
<em>named</em> if you knew what it <em>was.</em> "They're called
buckytubes, or carbon nanotubes. It's a kind of fullerene that was
discovered just this year. It's about a hundred times stronger than
steel and a sixth of the weight."</p>
<p>Hermione looked up from the graph paper, her face surprised.
"That's <em>real?</em> "</p>
<p>"Yeah," Harry said, "just hard to make the Muggle way. If we
could get enough of the stuff, we could use it to build a space
elevator all the way up to geosynchronous orbit or higher, and in
terms of delta-v that's halfway to anywhere in the Solar System.
Plus we could throw out solar power satellites like confetti."</p>
<p>Hermione was frowning again. "Is this stuff <em>safe?</em> "</p>
<p>"I don't see why it wouldn't be," Harry said. "A buckytube is
just a graphite sheet wrapped into a circular tube, basically, and
graphite is the same stuff used in pencils -"</p>
<p>"I <em>know</em> what graphite is, Harry," Hermione said. She
brushed her hair back absentmindedly, her eyebrows furrowed as she
stared at the sheet of paper.</p>
<p>Harry reached into a pocket of his robes, and produced a white
thread tied to two small gray plastic rings at either end. He'd
added drops of superglue where the thread met either ring, to make
it all a single object that could be Transfigured as a whole.
Cyanoacrylate, if Harry remembered correctly, worked by covalent
bonds, and that was as close to being a "solid object" as you ever
got in a world ultimately composed of tiny individual atoms. "When
you're ready," Harry said, "try to Transfigure this into a set of
aligned buckytube fibers embedded in two solid diamond rings."</p>
<p>"All right..." Hermione said slowly. "Harry, I feel like I just
missed something."</p>
<p>Harry shrugged helplessly. <em>Maybe you're just tired.</em> He
knew better than to say it out loud, though.</p>
<p>Hermione laid her wand against one plastic ring, and stared for
a while.</p>
<p>Two small circles of glittering diamond lay on the table,
connected by a long black thread.</p>
<p>"It changed," said Hermione. She sounded like she was trying to
be enthusiastic but had run out of energy. "Now what?"</p>
<p>Harry felt a bit deflated by his research partner's lack of
passion, but did his best not to show it; maybe the same process
would work in reverse to cheer her up. "Now I test it to see if it
holds weight."</p>
<p>There was an A-frame Harry had rigged up to do an earlier
experiment with diamond rods - you could make solid diamond objects
easily, using Transfiguration, they just wouldn't last. The earlier
experiment had measured whether Transfiguring a long diamond rod
into a shorter diamond rod would allow it to lift a suspended heavy
weight as it contracted, i.e., could you Transfigure against
tension, which you in fact could.</p>
<p>Harry carefully looped one circle of glittering diamond over the
thick metal hook at the top of the rig, then attached a thick metal
hanger to the bottom ring, and then started attaching weights to
the hanger.</p>
<p>(Harry had asked the Weasley twins to Transfigure the apparatus
for him, and the Weasley twins had given him an incredulous look,
like they couldn't figure out what sort of prank he could
<em>possibly</em> want that for, but they hadn't asked any
questions. And their Transfigurations, according to them, lasted
for around three hours, so Harry and Hermione still had a while
left.)</p>
<p>"One hundred kilograms," Harry said about a minute later. "I
don't think a steel thread this thin would hold that. It should go
up much higher, but that's all the weight I've got."</p>
<p>There was a further silence.</p>
<p>Harry straightened up, and went back to their table, and sat
down in his chair, and ceremoniously made a check mark next to
'Buckytubes'. "There," Harry said. "<em>That</em> one worked."</p>
<p>"But it's not really <em>useful</em>, Harry, is it?" Hermione
said from where she was sitting with her head resting in her hands.
"I mean, even if we gave it to a scientist they couldn't learn how
to make lots of buckytubes from studying ours."</p>
<p>"They might be able to learn <em>something,</em>" Harry said.
"Hermione, <em>look</em> at it, that little tiny thread holding up
all that weight, we just made something that no Muggle laboratory
could make -"</p>
<p>"But any other witch could make it," Hermione said. Her
exhaustion was coming into her voice, now. "Harry, I don't think
this is working out."</p>
<p>"You mean our relationship?" Harry said. "Great! Let's break
up."</p>
<p>That got a slight grin out of her. "I mean our research."</p>
<p>"Oh, Hermione, how <em>could</em> you?"</p>
<p>"You're sweet when you're mean," she said. "But Harry, this is
nuts, I'm twelve, you're eleven, it's <em>silly</em> to think we're
going to discover anything that no one's ever figured out
before."</p>
<p>"Are you really saying we should give up on unraveling the
secrets of magic after trying for less than one <em>month?</em> "
Harry said, trying to put a note of challenge into his voice.
Honestly he was feeling some of the same fatigue as Hermione. None
of the <em>good</em> ideas ever worked. He'd made just one
discovery worth mentioning, the Mendelian pattern, and he couldn't
tell Hermione about it without breaking his promise to Draco.</p>
<p>"No," Hermione said. Her young face was looking very serious and
adult. "I'm saying right now we should be <em>studying</em> all the
magic that wizards already know, so we can do this sort of thing
after we graduate from Hogwarts."</p>
<p>"Um..." Harry said. "Hermione, I hate to put it this way, but
imagine we'd decided to hold off on research until later, and the
first thing we tried after we graduated was Transfiguring an
Alzheimer's cure, and it <em>worked.</em> We'd feel... I don't
think the word <em>stupid</em> would adequately describe how we'd
feel. What if there's something else like that and it does
work?"</p>
<p>"That's not <em>fair,</em> Harry!" Hermione said. Her voice was
trembling like she was on the verge of breaking out crying. "You
can't <em>put</em> that on people! It's not our <em>job</em> to do
that sort of thing, we're <em>kids!</em> "</p>
<p>For a moment Harry wondered what would happen if someone told
Hermione she had to fight an immortal Dark Lord, if she would turn
into one of the whiny self-pitying heroes that Harry could never
stand reading about in his books.</p>
<p>"Anyway," Hermione said. Her voice shook. "I don't want to keep
doing this. I don't believe children can do things that grownups
can't, that's only in stories."</p>
<p>There was silence in the classroom.</p>
<p>Hermione started to look a little scared, and Harry knew that
his own expression had gotten colder.</p>
<p>It might not have hurt so much if the same thought hadn't
already come to Harry - that, while thirty might be old for a
scientific revolutionary and twenty about right, while there were
people who got doctorates when they were seventeen and
fourteen-year-old heirs who'd been great kings or generals, there
wasn't really anyone who'd made the history books at eleven.</p>
<p>"All right," Harry said. "Figure out how to do something a
grownup can't. Is that your challenge?"</p>
<p>"I didn't mean it like that," Hermione said, her voice coming
out in a frightened whisper.</p>
<p>With an effort, Harry wrenched his gaze away from Hermione. "I'm
not angry at <em>you</em>," Harry said. His voice was cold, despite
his best efforts. "I'm angry at, I don't know, everything. But I'm
not willing to lose, Hermione. Losing isn't always the right thing
to do. I'll figure out how to do something a grown wizard can't do,
and then I'll get back to you. How's that?"</p>
<p>There was more silence.</p>
<p>"Okay," said Hermione, her voice wavering a little. She pushed
herself up out of her chair, and went over to the door of the
abandoned classroom they'd been working in. Her hand went onto the
doorknob. "We're still friends, right? And if you can't figure out
anything -"</p>
<p>Her voice halted.</p>
<p>"Then we'll study together," Harry said. His voice was even
colder now.</p>
<p>"Um, bye for now, then," Hermione said, and she quickly went out
of the room and shut the door behind her.</p>
<p>Sometimes Harry hated having a dark side, even when he was
inside it.</p>
<p>And the part of him that had thought exactly the same thing as
Hermione, that no, children <em>couldn't</em> do what grownups
couldn't, was saying all the things that Hermione had been too
frightened to say, like, <em>That's one hell of a difficult
challenge you just grabbed for yourself</em> and <em>boy are you
going to end up with egg on your face this time</em> and <em>at
least this way you'll know you've failed.</em></p>
<p>And the part of him that didn't enjoy losing replied, in a very
cold voice, <em>Fine, you can shut up and watch.</em></p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>It was almost lunchtime, and Harry didn't care. He hadn't even
bothered grabbing a snack bar from his pouch. His stomach could
stand a little starving.</p>
<p>The wizarding world was tiny, they didn't think like scientists,
they didn't know science, they didn't question what they'd grown up
with, they hadn't put protective shells on their time machines,
they played Quidditch, all of magical Britain was smaller than a
small Muggle city, the greatest wizarding school only educated up
to the age of seventeen, <em>silly</em> wasn't challenging that at
eleven, <em>silly</em> was <em>assuming</em> wizards knew what they
were doing and had already exhausted all the low-hanging fruit a
scientific polymath would see.</p>
<p>Step One had been to make a list of every magical constraint
Harry could remember, all the things you supposedly couldn't
do.</p>
<p>Step Two, mark the constraints that seemed to make the
<em>least</em> sense from a scientific perspective.</p>
<p>Step Three, prioritize constraints that a wizard would be
unlikely to question if they <em>didn't</em> know science.</p>
<p>Step Four, come up with avenues for attacking them.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Hermione still felt a little shaky as she sat down next to Mandy
at the Ravenclaw table. Hermione's lunch had two fruits (tomato
slices and peeled tangerines), three vegetables (carrots, carrots,
and more carrots), one meat (fried Diricawl drumsticks whose
unhealthy coating she would carefully remove), and one little piece
of chocolate cake that she would earn by eating the other
parts.</p>
<p>It hadn't been as bad as Potions class, sometimes she still had
<em>nightmares</em> about that. But this time <em>she</em> had made
it happen and <em>she'd felt like its target.</em> Just for a
moment, before the terrible cold darkness looked away and said it
wasn't angry with her, because it hadn't wanted to scare her.</p>
<p>And she still had that feeling like she'd missed something
earlier, something really important.</p>
<p>But they hadn't violated any of the rules of Transfiguration...
had they? They hadn't made any liquids, any gases, they hadn't
taken orders from the Defense Professor...</p>
<p>The <em>pill!</em> That had been something to be eaten!</p>
<p>...well, no, nobody would just eat a pill lying around, it
hadn't <em>worked</em> actually, they could have just <em>Finite
Incantatemed</em> it if it had, but she would still have to tell
Harry about that and make sure they didn't mention it in front of
Professor McGonagall, in case they were never allowed to study
Transfiguration again...</p>
<p>Hermione was starting to get a really sick feeling in her
stomach. She pushed back her plate from the table, she couldn't eat
lunch like this.</p>
<p>And she closed her eyes and began to mentally recite the rules
of Transfiguration.</p>
<p><em>"I will never Transfigure anything into liquid or
gas."</em></p>
<p><em>"I will never Transfigure anything that looks like food or
anything else that goes inside a human body."</em></p>
<p>No, they really <em>shouldn't</em> have tried to Transfigure the
pill, or they should've at least <em>realized...</em> she'd been so
caught up in Harry's brilliant idea that she hadn't
<em>thought...</em></p>
<p>The sick feeling in Hermione's stomach was getting worse. There
was a feeling in her mind of something hovering just on the edge of
recognition, a perception about to invert itself, a young woman
about to become a crone, a vase about to become two faces...</p>
<p>And she went on remembering the rules of Transfiguration.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry's knuckles had gone white on his wand by the time he
stopped trying to Transfigure the air in front of his wand into a
paperclip. It wouldn't have been safe to Transfigure the paperclip
into gas, of course, but Harry didn't see any reason why it would
be unsafe the other way around. It just wasn't supposed to be
<em>possible</em>. But why not? Air was as real a substance as
anything else...</p>
<p>Well, maybe that limitation <em>did</em> make sense. Air was
disorganized, all the molecules constantly changing their relation
to each other. Maybe you couldn't impose a new form on substance
unless the substance was staying still long enough for you to
master it, even though the atoms in solids were also constantly
vibrating all the time...</p>
<p>The more Harry failed, the colder he felt, the clearer
everything seemed to become.</p>
<p>All right. Next on the list.</p>
<p>You could only Transfigure whole objects as wholes. You couldn't
Transfigure <em>half</em> a match into a needle, you had to
Transfigure the <em>whole thing.</em> Back when Harry had been
trapped in that classroom by Draco, it had been the reason he
couldn't just Transfigure a thin cylindrical cross-section of the
walls into sponge, and punch out a chunk of stone large enough for
him to fit through the hole. He would have needed to impose a new
form on the whole wall, and maybe a whole section of Hogwarts, just
in order to change that little cross-section.</p>
<p>And that was <em>ridiculous</em>.</p>
<p><em>Things were made of atoms.</em> Lots of little tiny dots.
There <em>was</em> no contiguity, there <em>was</em> no solidity,
just electromagnetic forces holding the little dots related to each
other...</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Mandy Brocklehurst paused with her fork on her way to her mouth.
"Huh," she said to Su Li, sitting across from the now-empty space
beside her, "what got into Hermione?"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry wanted to kill his eraser.</p>
<p>He'd been trying to change a single spot on the pink rectangle
into steel, apart from the rest of the rubber, and the eraser
wasn't cooperating.</p>
<p>It <em>had</em> to be a conceptual limitation, not a real one.
<em>Had</em> to be.</p>
<p><em>Things were made of atoms,</em> and every atom was a tiny
separate thing. Atoms were held together by a quantum mist of
shared electrons, for covalent bonds, or sometimes just magnetism
at close ranges, for ionic bonds or van der Waals forces.</p>
<p>If it came down to that, the protons and neutrons inside the
nuclei were tiny separate things. The quarks inside the protons and
neutrons were tiny separate things! There simply <em>wasn't</em>
anything in reality, the world-out-there, that corresponded to
people's conceit of solid objects. It was all just little dots.</p>
<p>And free Transfiguration was all in the mind to begin with,
wasn't it? No words, no gestures. Only the pure concept of form,
kept strictly separate from substance, imposed on the substance,
conceived of apart from its form. That and the wand and whatever
made you a wizard.</p>
<p>The wizards couldn't transform parts of things, could only
transform what their minds perceived as wholes, because they didn't
<em>know in their bones</em> that it was all just atoms deep
down.</p>
<p>Harry had focused on that knowledge as hard as he could, the
<em>true fact</em> that the eraser was just a collection of atoms,
everything was just collections of atoms, and the atoms of the
little patch he was trying to Transfigure formed <em>just as
valid</em> a collection as any other collection he cared to think
about.</p>
<p>And Harry still hadn't been able to change that single part of
the eraser, the Transfiguration wasn't going anywhere.</p>
<p><em>This. Was. Ridiculous.</em></p>
<p>Harry's knuckles were whitening on his wand again. He was
<em>sick</em> of getting experimental results that <em>didn't make
sense.</em></p>
<p>Maybe the fact that <em>some</em> part of his mind was still
thinking in terms of objects was stopping the Transfiguration from
going through. He had thought of a collection of atoms that was an
<em>eraser.</em> He had thought of a collection that was a
<em>little patch.</em></p>
<p>Time to kick it up a notch.</p>
<p>Harry pressed his wand harder against that tiny section of
eraser, and tried to see through the illusion that nonscientists
thought was reality, the world of desks and chairs, air and erasers
and people.</p>
<p>When you walked through a park, the immersive world that
surrounded you was something that existed inside your own brain as
a pattern of neurons firing. The sensation of a bright blue sky
wasn't something high above you, it was something in your visual
cortex, and your visual cortex was in the back of your brain. All
the sensations of that bright world were really happening in that
quiet cave of bone you called your skull, the place where
<em>you</em> lived and never, ever left. If you really wanted to
say hello to someone, to the <em>actual person,</em> you wouldn't
shake their hand, you'd knock gently on their skull and say "How
are you doing in there?" That was what people were, that was where
they really lived. And the <em>picture</em> of the park that you
thought you were <em>walking through</em> was something that was
visualized inside your brain as it processed the signals sent down
from your eyes and retina.</p>
<p>It wasn't a <em>lie</em> like the Buddhists thought, there
wasn't something terribly mystical and unexpected behind the veil
of Maya, what lay beyond the illusion of the park was just the
<em>actual park</em>, but it was all still <em>illusion</em>.</p>
<p>Harry wasn't sitting inside the classroom.</p>
<p>He wasn't looking at the eraser.</p>
<p>Harry was inside Harry's skull.</p>
<p>He was experiencing a processed picture his brain had decoded
from the signals sent down by his retina.</p>
<p>The real eraser was somewhere else, somewhere that wasn't the
picture.</p>
<p>And the real eraser wasn't like the picture Harry's brain had of
it. The idea of the eraser as a <em>solid object</em> was something
that existed only inside his own brain, inside the parietal cortex
that processed his sense of shape and space. The real eraser was a
collection of atoms held together by electromagnetic forces and
shared covalent electrons, while nearby, air molecules bounced off
each other and bounced off the eraser-molecules.</p>
<p>The real eraser was far away, and Harry, inside his skull, could
never quite touch it, could only imagine ideas about it. But
<em>his wand had the power,</em> it could change things out there
in <em>reality</em>, it was only Harry's own preconceptions that
were <em>limiting</em> it. Somewhere beyond the veil of Maya, the
<em>truth</em> behind Harry's concept of "my wand" was touching the
collection of atoms that Harry's mind thought of as "a patch on the
eraser", and if that wand could change the collection of atoms that
Harry considered "the whole eraser", there was absolutely no reason
why it couldn't change the other collection too...</p>
<p>The Transfiguration still wasn't going through.</p>
<p>Harry's teeth clenched together, and he kicked it up
<em>another</em> notch.</p>
<p>The concept Harry's mind had of the eraser as a single object
was <em>obvious nonsense.</em></p>
<p>It was a map that didn't and <em>couldn't</em> match the
territory.</p>
<p>Human beings modeled the world using stratified levels of
organization, they had <em>separate thoughts</em> about how
countries worked, how people worked, how organs worked, how cells
worked, how molecules worked, how quarks worked.</p>
<p>When Harry's brain needed to think about the eraser, it would
think about the rules that governed erasers, like "erasers can get
rid of pencil-marks". Only if Harry's brain needed to predict what
would happen on the lower chemical level, only then would Harry's
brain start thinking - as though it were a separate fact - about
rubber molecules.</p>
<p>But that was all in the <em>mind.</em></p>
<p>Harry's mind might have separate <em>beliefs</em> about rules
that governed erasers, but there was no <em>separate law of
physics</em> that governed erasers.</p>
<p>Harry's mind modeled reality using multiple levels of
organization, with different beliefs about each level. But that was
all in the <em>map,</em> the true territory wasn't like that,
<em>reality itself</em> had only a <em>single</em> level of
organization, the quarks, it was a unified low-level process
obeying mathematically simple rules.</p>
<p>Or at least that was what Harry had believed before he'd found
out about magic, but the eraser wasn't magical.</p>
<p>And even if the eraser <em>had</em> been magical, the idea that
there could <em>really exist</em> a single solid eraser was
<em>impossible.</em> Things like erasers <em>couldn't</em> be basic
elements of reality, they were too big and complicated to be atoms,
they <em>had</em> to be made of parts<em>.</em> You couldn't have
things that were <em>fundamentally complicated</em>. The implicit
belief that Harry's brain had in the eraser as a single object
wasn't just <em>wrong,</em> it was a map-territory confusion, the
eraser only existed as a separate concept in Harry's multi-level
<em>model</em> of the world, not as a separate element of
single-level reality.</p>
<p>...the Transfiguration <em>still wasn't happening.</em></p>
<p>Harry was breathing heavily, failed Transfiguration was almost
as tiring as successful Transfiguration, but <em>damned</em> if
he'd give up now.</p>
<p>All right, screw this nineteenth-century garbage.</p>
<p>Reality wasn't atoms, it wasn't a set of tiny billiard balls
bopping around. That was just another lie. The notion of atoms as
little dots was just another convenient hallucination that people
clung to because they didn't want to confront the inhumanly alien
shape of the underlying reality. No wonder, then, that his attempts
to Transfigure based on that hadn't worked. If he wanted power, he
had to abandon his humanity, and force his thoughts to conform to
the true math of quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>There <em>were no particles,</em> there were just <em>clouds of
amplitude</em> in a <em>multiparticle configuration space</em> and
what his brain fondly imagined to be an eraser was nothing except a
gigantic <em>factor</em> in a wavefunction that <em>happened to
factorize</em>, it didn't have a separate existence any more than
there was a particular solid factor of 3 hidden inside the number
6, if his wand was capable of <em>altering factors in an
approximately factorizable wavefunction</em> then it should damn
well be able to alter the slightly <em>smaller</em> factor that
Harry's brain visualized as a patch of material on the eraser -</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Hermione tore through the hallways, shoes pounding hard on the
stone, breath coming in pants, the shock of adrenaline still racing
through her blood.</p>
<p>Like a picture of a young woman turning into an old crone, like
the cup becoming two faces.</p>
<p>What had they been doing?</p>
<p><em>What had they been doing?</em></p>
<p>She came to the classroom and her fingers slipped on the
doorknob at first, too sweaty, she grabbed harder and the door
opened -</p>
<p>- in a single flash of perception she saw Harry staring at a
small pink rectangle on the table in front of him -</p>
<p>- as a few paces away the tiny black thread, almost invisible
from this distance, supported all that weight -</p>
<p><em>"Harry get out of the classroom!"</em></p>
<p>Pure shock crossed Harry's face, and he stood up so fast he
almost fell over, stopping only to grab the small pink rectangle
from the table, and he tore out of the door, she'd already stepped
aside, her wand was already in her hand coming up pointing at the
thread -</p>
<p>"<em>Finite Incantatem!</em> "</p>
<p>And Hermione slammed the door shut again, just as the gigantic
crash of a hundred kilograms of falling metal came from inside.</p>
<p>She was panting, gasping for air, she'd run all the way here
without stopping, she was soaked in sweat and her legs and thighs
burned like living flames, she couldn't have answered Harry's
questions for all the Galleons in the world.</p>
<p>Hermione blinked, and realized that she had started to fall, and
Harry had caught her, and was lowering her gently to sit on the
floor.</p>
<p>"...healthy..." she managed to whisper.</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " said Harry, looking paler than she'd ever seen
him.</p>
<p>"...are you, feeling, healthy..."</p>
<p>Harry started looking even more frightened as the question sank
in. "I, I don't think I have any symptoms -"</p>
<p>Hermione closed her eyes for a moment. "Good," she whispered.
"Catch, breath."</p>
<p>That took a while. Harry was still looking scared. That was good
too, maybe it would teach him a lesson.</p>
<p>Hermione reached into the pouch Harry had bought her, whispered
"water" through her parched throat, took out the bottle and drank
in great huge gulps.</p>
<p>And then it was still a while before she could talk again.</p>
<p>"We broke the rules, Harry," she said in a hoarse voice. "We
broke the rules."</p>
<p>"I..." Harry swallowed. "I still don't see how, I've been
<em>thinking</em> but -"</p>
<p>"I asked if the Transfiguration was safe and <em>you answered
me!</em> "</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>"That's it?" Harry said.</p>
<p>She could have screamed.</p>
<p>"Harry, don't you get it?" she said. "It's made out of tiny
fibers, what if it <em>unraveled,</em> who <em>knows</em> what
could go wrong, <em>we didn't ask Professor McGonagall!</em> Don't
you see what we were doing? We were experimenting with
Transfiguration. We were <em>experimenting</em> with
<em>Transfiguration!</em> "</p>
<p>There was another pause.</p>
<p>"Right..." Harry said slowly. "That's probably one of those
things they don't even bother telling you <em>not</em> to do
because it's too obvious. Don't test brilliant new ideas for
Transfiguration by yourselves in an unused classroom without
consulting any professors."</p>
<p>"You could have gotten us killed, Harry!" Hermione knew it
wasn't fair, she'd made the mistake too, but she still felt angry
at him, he always sounded so confident and that had dragged her
unthinkingly along in his wake. "We could have <em>spoiled
Professor McGonagall's perfect record!</em> "</p>
<p>"Yes," said Harry, "let's not tell her about this, shall
we?"</p>
<p>"We have to stop," Hermione said. "We have to stop this or we're
going to get hurt. We're too young, Harry, we can't do this, not
yet."</p>
<p>A weak grin crossed Harry's face. "Um, you're sort of wrong
about that."</p>
<p>And he held out a small pink rectangle, a rubber eraser with a
bright metal patch on it.</p>
<p>Hermione stared at it, puzzled.</p>
<p>"Quantum mechanics wasn't enough," Harry said. "I had to go all
the way down to timeless physics before it took. Had to see the
wand as enforcing a <em>relation</em> between separate past and
future realities, instead of <em>changing</em> anything over time -
but I did it, Hermione, I saw past the illusion of objects, and I
bet there's not a single other wizard in the world who could have.
Even if some Muggleborn knew about timeless formulations of quantum
mechanics, it would just be a weird belief about strange distant
quantum stuff, they wouldn't <em>see</em> that it was
<em>reality</em>, accept that the world they knew was just a
hallucination. I Transfigured <em>part</em> of the eraser without
changing the <em>whole thing.</em>"</p>
<p>Hermione raised her wand again, pointed it at the eraser.</p>
<p>For a moment anger crossed Harry's face, but he didn't make any
move to stop her.</p>
<p>"<em>Finite Incantatem</em>," said Hermione. "Check with
Professor McGonagall before you try it again."</p>
<p>Harry nodded, though his face was still a bit tight.</p>
<p>"And we still have to stop," said Hermione.</p>
<p>"<em>Why?</em> " said Harry. "Don't you see what this
<em>means</em>, Hermione? Wizards <em>don't</em> know everything!
There's too few of them, even fewer who know any science, they
haven't exhausted the low-hanging fruit -"</p>
<p>"It's not <em>safe</em>," Hermione said. "If we <em>can</em>
find out new things it's even <em>less</em> safe! We're <em>too
young!</em> We made one big mistake already, next time we could
just <em>die!</em> "</p>
<p>Then Hermione flinched.</p>
<p>Harry looked away from her, and started taking slow, deep
breaths.</p>
<p>"Please don't try to do it alone, Harry," Hermione said, her
voice trembling. "Please."</p>
<p><em>Please don't make me have to decide whether to tell
Professor Flitwick.</em></p>
<p>There was a long pause.</p>
<p>"So you want us to study," Harry said. She could tell he was
trying to keep the anger out of his voice. "Just study."</p>
<p>Hermione wasn't sure if she should say anything, but... "Like
you studied, um, timeless physics, right?"</p>
<p>Harry looked back at her.</p>
<p>"That thing you did," Hermione said, her voice tentative, "it
wasn't because of <em>our</em> experiments, right? You could do it
because you'd read lots of books."</p>
<p>Harry opened his mouth, and then he shut it again. There was a
frustrated look on his face.</p>
<p>"All right," Harry said. "How about this. We study, and if I
think of anything that seems <em>really</em> worth trying, we'll
try it after I ask a professor."</p>
<p>"Okay," Hermione said. She didn't fall over with relief, but
only because she was already sitting down.</p>
<p>"Shall we get lunch?" Harry said cautiously.</p>
<p>Hermione nodded. Yes. Lunch sounded good. For real, this
time.</p>
<p>She carefully began to push herself off the stone floor, wincing
as her body screamed at her -</p>
<p>Harry pointed his wand at her and said "<em>Wingardium
Leviosa.</em>"</p>
<p>Hermione blinked as the huge weight on her legs diminished to
something bearable.</p>
<p>A smile quirked across Harry's face. "You can <em>lift</em>
something without being able to Hover it completely," he said.
"Remember that experiment?"</p>
<p>Hermione smiled back helplessly, although she thought she ought
to still be angry.</p>
<p>And she started walking back toward the Great Hall, feeling
remarkably and wonderfully light on her feet, as Harry carefully
kept his wand trained on her.</p>
<p>He only managed to keep it up for five minutes, but it was the
thought that counted.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Minerva looked at Dumbledore.</p>
<p>Dumbledore gazed back inquiringly at her. "Did you understand
any of that?" the Headmaster said, sounding bemused.</p>
<p>It had been the most complete and utter gibberish that Minerva
could ever remember hearing. She was feeling a bit embarrassed
about having summoned the Headmaster to hear it, but she'd been
given explicit instructions.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid not," Professor McGonagall said primly.</p>
<p>"So," Dumbledore said. The silver beard swung away from her, the
old wizard's twinkling gaze looked elsewhere once more. "You
suspect you might be able to do something that other wizards can't
do, something we think is impossible."</p>
<p>The three of them stood within the Headmaster's private
Transfiguration workroom, where the shining phoenix of Dumbledore's
Patronus had told her to bring Harry, moments after her own
Patronus had reached him. Light shone down through the skylights
and illuminated the great seven-pointed alchemical diagram drawn in
the center of the circular room, showing it to be a little dusty,
which saddened Minerva. Transfiguration research was one of
Dumbledore's great enjoyments, and she'd known how pressed for time
he'd been lately, but not that he was <em>this</em> pressed.</p>
<p>And now Harry Potter was going to waste even more of the
Headmaster's time. But she certainly couldn't blame <em>Harry</em>
for that. He'd done the proper thing in coming to her to say that
he'd had an idea for doing something in Transfiguration that was
currently believed to be impossible, and she herself had done
exactly what she'd been told to do: she'd ordered Harry to be quiet
and not discuss anything with her until she had consulted the
Headmaster and they'd finished moving to a secure location.</p>
<p>If Harry had started out by saying what <em>specifically</em> he
thought he could do, she wouldn't have bothered.</p>
<p>"Look, I know it's hard to explain," Harry said, sounding a
little embarrassed. "What it adds up to is that what you believe
conflicts with what scientists believe, in a case where I'd
genuinely expect scientists to know more than wizards."</p>
<p>Minerva would have sighed out loud, if Dumbledore hadn't seemed
to be taking the whole thing very seriously.</p>
<p>Harry's idea stemmed from simple ignorance, nothing more. If you
changed half of a metal ball into glass, the <em>whole ball</em>
had a different Form. To change the part <em>was</em> to change the
whole, and that meant removing the whole Form and replacing it with
a different one. What would it even <em>mean</em> to Transfigure
only half of a metal ball? That the metal ball <em>as a whole</em>
had the same Form as before, but <em>half</em> that ball now had a
different Form?</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter," said Professor McGonagall, "what you want to do
isn't just impossible, it's <em>illogical.</em> If you change half
of something, you <em>did</em> change the whole."</p>
<p>"Indeed," said Dumbledore. "But Harry is the hero, so he may be
able to do things that are logically impossible."</p>
<p>Minerva would have rolled her eyes, if she hadn't gone numb a
long time ago.</p>
<p>"Supposing it <em>was</em> possible," said Dumbledore, "can you
think of any reason why the results would differ in any way from
ordinary Transfiguration?"</p>
<p>Minerva frowned. The fact that the concept was literally
unimaginable was presenting her with some difficulty, but she tried
to take it at face value. A Transfiguration imposed on only half of
a metal ball...</p>
<p>"Strange things happening at the interface?" said Minerva. "But
that should be no different than Transfiguring the object as a
whole, into a Form with two different parts..."</p>
<p>Dumbledore nodded. "That is my own thought as well. And Harry,
if your theory is correct, it implies that what you want to do is
<em>exactly</em> like any other Transfiguration, only applied to a
part of the subject rather than the whole? No changes <em>at
all?</em> "</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said firmly. "That's the whole point."</p>
<p>Dumbledore looked at her again. "Minerva, can you think of any
reason whatsoever why that would be dangerous?"</p>
<p>"No," said Minerva, after she had finished searching through her
memory.</p>
<p>"Likewise myself," said the Headmaster. "All right, then, since
this ought to be exactly analogous to ordinary Transfiguration in
all respects, and since we cannot think of any reason whatsoever
why it would be dangerous, I think that the second degree of
caution will suffice."</p>
<p>Minerva was surprised, but she didn't object. Dumbledore was by
far her senior in Transfiguration, and he had tried literally
thousands of new Transfigurations without ever choosing a degree of
caution that was too low. He had used Transfiguration <em>in
combat</em> and he was <em>still alive.</em> If the Headmaster
thought the second degree was enough, it was enough.</p>
<p>That Harry was certainly going to fail was, of course,
completely irrelevant.</p>
<p>The two of them started setting up the wards and detection webs.
The most important web was the one that checked to make sure no
Transfigured material had entered the air. Harry would be enclosed
in a separate shell of force with its own air supply just to be
certain, only his wand allowed to leave the shield, and the
interface tight. They were inside Hogwarts so they couldn't
automatically Apparate out any material that showed signs of
spontaneous combustion, but they could launch it out a skylight
almost as fast, the windows all folded outward for exactly that
reason. Harry himself would go out a different skylight at the
first sign of trouble.</p>
<p>Harry watched them working, his face looking a little
frightened.</p>
<p>"Don't worry," said Professor McGonagall in the middle of her
running description, "this almost certainly won't be necessary, Mr.
Potter. If we <em>expected</em> anything to go wrong you would not
be allowed to try. It's just ordinary precautions for any
Transfiguration no one has ever tried before."</p>
<p>Harry swallowed and nodded.</p>
<p>And a few minutes later, Harry was strapped into the safety
chair and resting his wand against a metal ball - one that, based
on his current test scores, should have been too large for him to
Transfigure in less than thirty minutes.</p>
<p>And a few minutes after <em>that,</em> Minerva was leaning
against the wall, feeling faint.</p>
<p>There was a small patch of glass on the ball where Harry's wand
had rested.</p>
<p>Harry didn't say <em>I told you so,</em> but the smug look on
his sweating face said it for him.</p>
<p>Dumbledore was casting analytic Charms on the ball, looking more
and more intrigued by the moment. Thirty years had melted off his
face.</p>
<p>"Fascinating," said Dumbledore. "It's exactly as he claimed. He
simply Transfigured a part of the subject without Transfiguring the
whole. You say it's really just a conceptual limitation,
Harry?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said, "but a deep one, just knowing it had to be a
conceptual limitation wasn't enough. I had to suppress the part of
my mind that was making the error and think instead about the
underlying reality that scientists figured out."</p>
<p>"Truly fascinating," Dumbledore said. "I take it that for any
other wizard to do the same would require months of study if they
could do it at all? And may I ask you to partially Transfigure some
other subjects?"</p>
<p>"Probably yes and of course," Harry said.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, Minerva was feeling equally bewildered, but
considerably reassured about the safety issues.</p>
<p>It <em>was</em> the same, aside from being logically
impossible.</p>
<p>"I believe that's enough, Headmaster," Minerva said finally. "I
suspect partial Transfiguration is more tiring than the ordinary
sort."</p>
<p>"Getting less so with practice," said the exhausted and pale
boy, voice unsteady, "but yeah, you've got that right."</p>
<p>The process of extracting Harry from the wards took another
minute, and then Minerva escorted him to a much more comfortable
chair, and Dumbledore produced an ice-cream soda.</p>
<p>"<em>Congratulations</em>, Mr. Potter!" said Professor
McGonagall, and meant it. She would have bet almost anything
against that working.</p>
<p>"Congratulations indeed," said Dumbledore. "Even I did not make
any original discoveries in Transfiguration before the age of
fourteen. Not since the day of Dorotea Senjak has any genius
flowered so early."</p>
<p>"Thanks," Harry said, sounding a little surprised.</p>
<p>"Nonetheless," Dumbledore said thoughtfully, "I think it would
be most wise to keep this happy event a secret, at least for now.
Harry, did you discuss your idea with any other person before you
spoke to Professor McGonagall?"</p>
<p>There was silence.</p>
<p>"Um..." Harry said. "I don't want to turn anyone over to the
Inquisition, but I did tell one other student -"</p>
<p>The word almost exploded from Professor McGonagall's lips.
"<em>What?</em> You discussed a completely novel form of
Transfiguration with a <em>student</em> before consulting a
recognized authority? Do you have any idea how
<em>irresponsible</em> that was?"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," said Harry. "I didn't realize."</p>
<p>The boy looked appropriately frightened, and Minerva felt
something inside her relax. At least Harry understood how foolish
he'd been.</p>
<p>"You must swear Miss Granger to secrecy," Dumbledore said
gravely. "And do not tell anyone else unless there is an extremely
good reason for it, and they too have sworn."</p>
<p>"Ah... why?" Harry said.</p>
<p>Minerva was wondering the same thing. Once again the Headmaster
was thinking too far ahead for her to keep up.</p>
<p>"Because you can do something that no one else will believe you
can do," Dumbledore said. "Something completely unexpected. It may
prove to be your critical advantage, Harry, and we must preserve
it. Please, trust me in this."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall nodded, her firm face showing nothing of
her inner confusion. "Please do, Mr. Potter," she said.</p>
<p>"All right..." Harry said slowly.</p>
<p>"Once we have finished examining your materials," Dumbledore
added, "you may practice partial Transfiguration, on glass to steel
and steel to glass <em>only</em>, with Miss Granger to act as your
spotter. Naturally, if either of you suspect any symptom of any
form of Transfiguration sickness, inform a professor at once."</p>
<p>Just before Harry left the workroom, with his hand on the
doorhandle, the boy turned back and said, "As long as we're here,
have either of you noticed anything different about Professor
Snape?"</p>
<p>"Different?" said the Headmaster.</p>
<p>Minerva didn't let her wry smile show on her face. Of course the
boy was apprehensive about the 'evil Potions Master', since he had
no way of knowing why Severus was to be trusted. It would have been
odd to say the least, explaining to Harry that Severus was still in
love with his mother.</p>
<p>"I mean, has his behavior changed recently in any way?" said
Harry.</p>
<p>"Not that I have seen..." the Headmaster said slowly. "Why do
you ask?"</p>
<p>Harry shook his head. "I don't want to prejudice your own
observations by saying. Just keep an eye out, maybe?"</p>
<p>That sent a quiver of unease through Minerva in a way that no
outright accusation of Severus could have.</p>
<p>Harry bowed to both of them respectfully, and took his
leave.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"Albus," Minerva said after the boy had gone, "how did you
<em>know</em> to take Harry seriously? I would have thought his
idea merely impossible!"</p>
<p>The old wizard's face turned grave. "The same reason it must be
kept secret, Minerva. The same reason I told you to come to me, if
Harry made any such claim. Because it is a power that Voldemort
knows not."</p>
<p>The words took a few seconds to sink in.</p>
<p>And then the cold shiver went down her spine, as it always did
when she remembered.</p>
<p>It had started out as an ordinary job interview, Sybill
Trelawney applying for the position of Professor of Divination.</p>
<p><em>THE ONE WITH THE POWER TO VANQUISH THE DARK LORD
APPROACHES,<br>
BORN TO THOSE WHO HAVE THRICE DEFIED HIM,<br>
BORN AS THE SEVENTH MONTH DIES,<br>
AND THE DARK LORD WILL MARK HIM AS HIS EQUAL,<br>
BUT HE WILL HAVE POWER THE DARK LORD KNOWS NOT,<br>
AND EITHER MUST DESTROY ALL BUT A REMNANT OF THE OTHER,<br>
FOR THOSE TWO DIFFERENT SPIRITS CANNOT EXIST IN THE SAME
WORLD.</em></p>
<p>Those dreadful words, spoken in that terrible booming voice,
didn't seem to fit something like partial Transfiguration.</p>
<p>"Perhaps not, then," Dumbledore said after Minerva tried to
explain. "I confess I had been hoping for something that would help
in finding Voldemort's horcrux, wherever he may have hidden it.
But..." The old wizard shrugged. "Prophecies are tricky things,
Minerva, and it is best to take no chances. The smallest thing may
prove decisive if it remains unexpected."</p>
<p>"And what do you suppose he meant about <em>Severus?</em> " said
Minerva.</p>
<p>"There I have no idea," sighed Dumbledore. "Unless Harry is
making a move against Severus, and thought that an open question
might be taken seriously where a direct allegation would be
dismissed. And if that was indeed what happened, Harry correctly
reasoned that I would not trust that it was so. Let us simply keep
watch, without prejudice, as he asks."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Aftermath, 1:</em></p>
<p>"Um, Hermione?" Harry said in a very small voice. "I think I owe
you a really, really, really big apology."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Aftermath, 2:</em></p>
<p>Alissa Cornfoot's eyes were slightly glazed as she gazed upon
the Potions Master giving her class a stern lecture, holding up a
tiny bronze bean and saying something about screaming puddles of
human flesh. Ever since the start of this year she'd been having
trouble listening in Potions. She kept staring at their awful,
mean, greasy professor and fantasizing about special detentions.
There was probably something really <em>wrong</em> with her but she
just couldn't seem to stop doing it -</p>
<p>"Ow!" Alissa said then.</p>
<p>Snape had just flicked the bronze bean unerringly at Alissa's
forehead.</p>
<p>"Miss Cornfoot," said the Potions Master, his voice cutting,
"this is a delicate potion and if you cannot pay attention you will
hurt your classmates, not just yourself. See me after class."</p>
<p>The last four words didn't help her any, but she tried harder,
and managed to get through the day without melting anyone.</p>
<p>After class, Alissa approached the desk. Part of her wanted to
stand there meekly with her face abashed and her hands clasped
penitently behind her back, just in case, but some quiet instinct
told her this might be a <em>bad idea</em>. So instead she just
stood there with her face neutral, in a posture that was very
proper for a young lady, and said, "Professor?"</p>
<p>"Miss Cornfoot," Snape said without looking up from the sheets
he was grading, "I do not return your affections, I begin to find
your stares disturbing, and you will restrain your eyes henceforth.
Is that quite clear?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Alissa in a strangled squeak, and Snape dismissed
her, and she fled the classroom with her cheeks flaming like molten
lava.</p>

<p>There'd been a sinking feeling in Hermione's stomach lately,
every time she heard the other students talking about her and
Harry. She'd been in a shower stall this morning when she'd
overheard a conversation between Morag and Padma that had been the
last straw piled on top of quite a lot of other straws.</p>
<p>She was starting to think that getting involved in a rivalry
with Harry Potter had been a terrible mistake.</p>
<p>If she'd just <em>stayed away</em> from Harry Potter, she could
have been Hermione Granger, the brightest academic star of
Hogwarts, who was earning more points for Ravenclaw than anyone.
She wouldn't have been <em>as</em> famous as the Boy-Who-Lived, but
she would have been famous for <em>herself</em>.</p>
<p>Instead the Boy-Who-Lived had an academic rival, and her name
happened to be Hermione Granger.</p>
<p>And worse, she had gone on a date with him.</p>
<p>The idea of getting into a Romance with Harry had seemed like an
appealing idea at first. She'd read books like that, and if there
was anyone in Hogwarts who was a candidate for the heroine's love
interest it was obviously Harry Potter. Bright, funny, famous,
sometimes scary...</p>
<p>So she'd forced Harry into going on a date with her.</p>
<p>And now <em>she</em> was <em>his</em> love interest.</p>
<p>Or worse, one of the options on his dinner menu.</p>
<p>She'd been in a shower stall that morning and just about to turn
on the water, when she'd heard giggles coming from outside. And
she'd heard Morag talking about how that Muggleborn girl probably
wouldn't fight hard enough to win against Ginevra Weasley, and
Padma speculating that Harry Potter might decide he wanted
<em>both</em>.</p>
<p>It was like they didn't understand that GIRLS had options on
their dinner menu and BOYS fought over them.</p>
<p>But that wasn't even the part that hurt, really. It was that
when she scored 98 on one of Professor McGonagall's tests, the news
wasn't that Hermione Granger had scored the highest in the class,
the news was that Harry Potter's rival had scored seven more points
than him.</p>
<p>If you got too close to the Boy-Who-Lived, you became part of
his story.</p>
<p>You didn't get your own.</p>
<p>And the thought had come to Hermione that she should just walk
away, but that would've been too sad.</p>
<p>But she did want to get <em>back</em> what she'd accidentally
given away by letting herself become known as Harry's rival. She
wanted to be a separate person again instead of Harry Potter's
third leg, was that too much to ask?</p>
<p>It was a hard trap to climb out of once you fell in. No matter
how high you scored in class, even if you did something that
deserved a special dinnertime announcement, it just meant you were
rivaling Harry Potter again.</p>
<p>But she thought she'd come up with a way.</p>
<p>Something to do that <em>wouldn't</em> be seen as pushing up on
the opposite end of Harry Potter's seesaw.</p>
<p>It would be hard.</p>
<p>It would go against her nature.</p>
<p>She would have to fight someone very evil.</p>
<p>And she would need to ask someone even <em>more</em> evil for
help.</p>
<p>Hermione raised her hand to knock upon that terrible door.</p>
<p>She hesitated.</p>
<p>Hermione realized she was being <em>silly</em>, and raised her
hand a bit higher.</p>
<p>She tried to knock again.</p>
<p>Her hand quite failed to touch the door.</p>
<p>And then the door swung open anyway.</p>
<p>"Dear me," said the spider, sitting in its web. "Was it really
that hard to lose a single Quirrell point, Miss Granger?"</p>
<p>Hermione stood there with her hand raised, her cheeks growing
pink. It <em>had</em> been.</p>
<p>"Well, Miss Granger, I shall be merciful," said the evil
Professor Quirrell. "Consider it already lost. There, I have taken
a hard choice from you. Are you not grateful?"</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell," Hermione managed to say in a voice that
squeaked a little. "I have a lot of Quirrell points, don't I?"</p>
<p>"You do indeed," said Professor Quirrell. "Though one less than
you had before. Terrible, isn't it? Just think, if I don't like
your reason for coming here, you could lose another fifty. Maybe
I'd take them away one... by one... by one..."</p>
<p>Hermione's cheeks were going even redder. "You're really evil,
did anyone ever tell you that?"</p>
<p>"Miss Granger," Professor Quirrell said gravely, "it can be
dangerous to give people compliments like that when they have not
been truly earned. The recipient might feel bashful and undeserving
and want to do something worthy of your praise. Now what was it you
wanted to talk to me about, Miss Granger?"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>It was after lunch on Thursday afternoon, and Hermione and Harry
were ensconced in a little library nook, with a <em>Quietus</em>
field up so they could talk. Harry was lying stomach-down on the
ground with his elbows resting on the floor and his head in his
hands and his feet kicking up casually behind him. Hermione was
occupying a stuffed chair much too large for her, like she was the
Hermione center of a candy shell.</p>
<p>Harry had suggested that they could, as a first pass, read just
the <em>titles</em> of all the books in the library, and then
Hermione could read all the tables of contents.</p>
<p>Hermione had thought this was a brilliant idea. She'd never done
that with a library before.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there was a slight flaw in this plan.</p>
<p>Namely, they were both Ravenclaws.</p>
<p>Hermione was reading a book called <em>Magical
Mnemonics.</em><em><br></em></p>
<p>Harry was reading a book called <em>The Skeptical
Wizard.</em><em><br></em></p>
<p>Each had thought it was just one special exception they would
make only this one time, and neither had yet realized it was
impossible for either of them to ever finish reading all the book
titles no matter how hard they tried.</p>
<p>The quiet of their little nook was broken by two words.</p>
<p>"Oh, <em>no</em>," Harry suddenly said out loud, sounding like
the words had been torn out of him.</p>
<p>There was a bit more quiet.</p>
<p>"He <em>didn't</em>," Harry said, in the same voice.</p>
<p>Then she heard Harry start giggling helplessly.</p>
<p>Hermione looked up from her book.</p>
<p>"All right," she said, "what <em>is</em> it?"</p>
<p>"I just found out why you never ask the Weasleys about the
family rat," Harry said. "It's <em>really</em> awful and I
shouldn't be laughing and I'm a terrible person."</p>
<p>"Yes," Hermione said primly, "you are. Tell me too."</p>
<p>"Okay, first the background. There's a whole chapter in this
book about Sirius Black conspiracy theories. You remember who that
is, right?"</p>
<p>"Of course," said Hermione. Sirius Black was a traitor, a friend
of James Potter who had let Voldemort into the protected home of
the Potters.</p>
<p>"So it turns out there were a number of, shall we say,
<em>irregularities</em>, associated with Black going to Azkaban. He
didn't get a trial, and the Junior Minister in charge when the
Aurors arrested Black was none other than Cornelius Fudge, who
became our current Minister of Magic."</p>
<p>That sounded a little suspicious to Hermione too, and she said
as much.</p>
<p>Harry made a shrugging motion with his shoulders, as he lay on
the floor looking at his book. "Suspicious things happen all the
time, and if you're a conspiracy theorist you can always find
<em>something</em>."</p>
<p>"But <em>no trial?</em> " said Hermione.</p>
<p>"It was right after the Dark Lord's defeat," Harry said, his
voice serious as he said it. "Things were incredibly chaotic, and
when the Aurors tracked down Black he was standing there laughing
in a street ankle-deep in blood, with twenty eyewitnesses to
recount how he'd killed a friend of my father's named Peter
Pettigrew plus twelve bystanders. I'm not saying I approve of Black
not getting a trial. But these are wizards we're talking about
here, so it's not really any more suspicious than, I don't know,
the sort of thing people point to when they want to argue over who
shot John F. Kennedy. So anyway, Sirius Black is the wizarding Lee
Harvey Oswald. There's all sorts of conspiracy theories about who
<em>really</em> betrayed my parents instead of him, and one of the
favorites is Peter Pettigrew, and this is where it starts getting
complicated."</p>
<p>Hermione listened, fascinated. "But how do you go from there to
the Weasleys' <em>pet rat</em> -"</p>
<p>"Hold on," said Harry, "I'm getting there. Now, after
Pettigrew's death it came out that he'd been a spy for the Light -
not a double agent, just someone who snuck around and found things
out. He'd been good at that since he was a teenager, even in
Hogwarts he had a reputation for finding out all sorts of secrets.
So the conspiracy theory is that Pettigrew became an unregistered
Animagus while he was still in Hogwarts, an Animagus of something
small that could scurry around and listen to conversations. The
main problem being that successful Animagi are rare and doing it as
a teenager would be really unlikely, so of course the conspiracy
theory says that my father and Black were unregistered Animagi too.
And in that conspiracy theory, Pettigrew himself killed the twelve
bystanders, turned into his small Animagus form, and ran. So
Michael Shermer says there are four additional problems with this.
One, Black was the only one besides my parents who knew how to get
through the wards around their house." (Harry's voice was a little
hard as he said that.) "Two, Black was a more likely suspect to
start with than Pettigrew, there's a rumor Black deliberately tried
to get a student killed during his time at Hogwarts, and he was
from this really nasty pureblood family, Bellatrix Black was
literally his cousin. Three, Black was twenty times the fighting
wizard that Pettigrew was, even if he wasn't as smart. The duel
between them would have been like Professor Quirrell versus
Professor Sprout. Pettigrew probably didn't even get a chance to
draw his wand, let alone fake all the evidence the conspiracy
theory requires. And four, Black was standing in the street
<em>laughing.</em>"</p>
<p>"But the <em>rat</em> -" said Hermione.</p>
<p>"Right," Harry said. "Well, to make a long story short, Bill
Weasley decided that his little brother Percy's pet rat was
Pettigrew's Animagus form -"</p>
<p>Hermione's jaw dropped.</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said, "you wouldn't exactly expect Evil Pettigrew
to be living a sad and furtive life as the pet rat of an enemy
wizarding family, he'd either be with the Malfoys or, more likely,
off in the Carribean after a bit of plastic surgery. Anyway, Bill
knocks out his little brother Percy, stuns and grabs the rat, sends
out all these emergency owl messages -"</p>
<p>"Oh, <em>no!</em> " Hermione said, the words torn out of
her.</p>
<p>"- and somehow manages to gather Dumbledore, the Minister of
Magic, and the Head Auror -"</p>
<p>"He <em>didn't!</em> " said Hermione.</p>
<p>"And of course when they get there they think he's crazy, but
they use <em>Veritas Oculum</em> on the rat anyway, just to be
sure, and what do they discover?"</p>
<p>She would've <em>died</em>. "A rat."</p>
<p>"You win a cookie! So they dragged poor Bill Weasley off to St.
Mungo's and it turned out to be a pretty standard schizophrenic
break, it just happens to some people, especially young men around
what we'd consider college age. Guy was convinced he was
ninety-seven years old and had died and gone back in time to his
younger self via train station. And he responded perfectly well to
antipsychotics and is back to normal and everything's fine now,
except people don't talk as much anymore about Sirius Black
conspiracy theories, and you don't ever ask the Weasleys about the
family rat."</p>
<p>Hermione was giggling helplessly. It was really awful and she
shouldn't be laughing and she was a terrible person.</p>
<p>"The thing I <em>don't</em> understand," Harry said, after their
giggles had died down, "is <em>why</em> Black would hunt down
Pettigrew instead of running as fast as he could. He had to know
the Aurors would be after him. I wonder if they got the reason out
of Black before they took him to Azkaban? See, this is why people
who are absolutely positively guilty still go through the legal
system and get trials."</p>
<p>Hermione had to agree with that.</p>
<p>Soon Harry was done with his book while Hermione was only
halfway through hers - hers was a much more difficult book than
Harry's, but she still felt embarrassed about that. And then she
had to put <em>Magical Mnemonics</em> back on the shelf and drag
herself away, because it was time for her to face the most dreaded
class in Hogwarts, BROOMSTICK RIDING.</p>
<p>Harry tagged along as she walked there, even though his own
class wasn't until an hour and a half later, like a fighter jet
escorting a sad little propeller plane on its way to its own
funeral.</p>
<p>The boy wished her goodbye in a quiet, sympathetic voice, and
she walked onto the grassy fields of Doom.</p>
<p>And there was much shrieking and almost falling and horrible
brushes with death and the ground in completely the <em>wrong
place</em> and the sun getting in her eyes and Morag buzzing her
and Mandy thinking she was being <em>subtle</em> about always being
near enough to catch her if she fell and she <em>knew</em> the
other students were laughing at both of them but she never said
anything to Mandy because she didn't actually want to die.</p>
<p>After ten million years the class ended, and she was back on the
ground where she belonged until next Thursday. Sometimes she had
nightmares about it always being Thursday.</p>
<p><em>Why</em> everyone had to learn this, when they were just
going to Apparate or Floo or portkey everywhere once they grew up,
was a complete and utter mystery to Hermione. Nobody actually
needed to ride broomsticks as an adult, it was like being forced to
play dodgeball in P.E.</p>
<p>At least Harry had the decency to be ashamed of being good at
it.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>It was a couple of hours later, and she was in a Hufflepuff
study hall with Hannah, Susan, Leanne, and Megan. Professor
Flitwick, surprisingly diffident for a teacher, had asked if she
might possibly maybe help those four with their Charms homework for
a while, even though they weren't Ravenclaws, and Hermione had felt
so proud she'd almost <em>burst</em>.</p>
<p>Hermione took a piece of parchment, spilled a little bit of ink
on it, tore it into four pieces, crumpled them, and tossed the
pieces on the table.</p>
<p><em>She</em> could have gotten it just from crumpling it, but
doing all that made it more like garbage, and that helped when
someone was first practicing the Disposal Charm.</p>
<p>Hermione sharpened her ears and eyes, and said, "Okay, try
it."</p>
<p>"<em>Everto.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Everto.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Everto.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Everto.</em>"</p>
<p>Hermione didn't think she'd quite caught all the problems. "Can
you all try it again?"</p>
<p>An hour later Hermione had concluded that (1), Leanne and Megan
were sort of sloppy, but if you asked them to keep practicing
something, they would, (2) Hannah and Susan were focused and driven
to the point where you had to keep telling them to <em>slow
down</em> and <em>relax</em> and <em>think</em> about things
instead of <em>trying</em> so hard - it was odd to think that those
two would soon be <em>hers</em> - and (3) she liked helping
Hufflepuffs, the whole study hall had a very cheerful
atmosphere.</p>
<p>When she left for dinner, she found the Boy-Who-Lived reading a
book while he waited to escort her. It made her feel flattered, and
also a little worried because Harry didn't seem to really talk to
<em>anyone</em> besides her.</p>
<p>"Did you know there's a girl in Hufflepuff who's a
Metamorphmagus?" said Hermione as they headed toward the Great
Hall. "She makes her hair really red, like stopsign red not Weasley
red, and when she spilled hot tea on herself she turned into a
black-haired boy until she got it under control again."</p>
<p>"Really? Cool," said Harry, sounding a bit distracted. "Um,
Hermione, just to check, you know tomorrow is the last day to sign
up for Professor Quirrell's armies, right?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Hermione said. "The armies of the evil Professor
Quirrell." Her voice was a little angry, though Harry didn't know
why, of course.</p>
<p>"Hermione," Harry said, his voice exasperated, "he's not evil.
He's a little bit Dark and a whole lot Slytherin. It's not the same
as being <em>evil</em>."</p>
<p>Harry Potter had too many words for things, that was his
problem. He would have been better off if he'd just divided the
universe into Good and Bad. "Professor Quirrell called me up in
front of the whole class and told me to <em>shoot
someone!</em> "</p>
<p>"He was right," Harry said, his face sober. "I'm sorry,
Hermione, but he was. You should have shot <em>me,</em> I wouldn't
have minded. You can't learn Battle Magic if you can't practice
against real opponents using real spells. And now you're doing okay
in sparring, aren't you?"</p>
<p>Hermione was only twelve, and so she knew, but she couldn't put
it into words, she couldn't find the thing to say that would
convince Harry.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell had taken a young girl and called up that
girl in front of everyone, and ordered her to open fire without
provocation on a classmate.</p>
<p>It didn't <em>matter</em> if Professor Quirrell was right about
her needing to learn it.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall wouldn't ever have done that.</p>
<p>Professor Flitwick wouldn't ever have done that.</p>
<p>Maybe not even Professor Snape would have done that.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was <em>EVIL</em>.</p>
<p>But she couldn't find the words, and she knew that Harry would
never believe her.</p>
<p>"Hermione, I've talked to older students," Harry said.
"Professor Quirrell could be the <em>only</em> competent Defense
Professor we get in all seven years at Hogwarts. Anything else we
can learn later. If we want to study Defense, we have to do it
<em>this year.</em> The students who sign up for the
extracurricular stuff are going to be learning huge amounts, way
beyond what the Ministry thinks first-years are supposed to study -
did you know we're going to be learning the Patronus Charm? In
<em>January?</em> "</p>
<p>"The <em>Patronus Charm?</em> " Hermione said, her voice going
up in surprise.</p>
<p>Her books said that was one of the brightest magics known, a
weapon against the Darkest creatures, cast with pure positive
emotions. It wasn't something she'd expect the evil Professor
Quirrell to teach - or arrange to be taught, since Hermione
couldn't imagine he could do the spell himself.</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said. "Students don't usually learn the Patronus
Charm until their fifth years or even later! But Professor Quirrell
says the Ministry schedules were made up by talking Flobberworms,
and the ability to cast the Patronus Charm depends on emotions more
than magical strength. Professor Quirrell says that he thinks most
students do <em>way</em> less than they can, and this year he's
going to prove it."</p>
<p>There was the usual tone of awed worship that Harry's voice had
when he talked about Professor Quirrell, and Hermione gritted her
teeth and kept walking.</p>
<p>"I already signed up, actually," Hermione said, her voice a
little quiet. "I did it this morning. For everything, just like you
said."</p>
<p><em>In for a penny, in for a pound</em> was the usual
expression.</p>
<p>Besides, she didn't want to <em>lose</em>, and if she wanted to
win she had to learn.</p>
<p>"So you <em>will</em> be in the armies, then?" Harry's voice was
suddenly enthusiastic. "That's awesome, Hermione! I've already
gotten my list of soldiers, but I'm sure Professor Quirrell will
let me add one more, or trade -"</p>
<p>"I'm not joining <em>your</em> army." Hermione's voice was
sharp. She knew it was a reasonable assumption but it
<em>still</em> annoyed her.</p>
<p>Harry blinked. "Not Draco Malfoy's, surely. So you want to be in
the third army? Even though we don't know who the general
<em>is</em> yet?" Harry sounded surprised and a little wounded, and
she couldn't blame him, though of course she did blame him, since
in fact it was all his fault. "But why not mine?"</p>
<p>"Think about it," Hermione snapped, "and maybe you'll work it
out!"</p>
<p>And she sped up her stride and left Harry gaping behind her.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell," Draco said in his most formal voice, "I
must protest your appointment of Hermione Granger as the third
general."</p>
<p>"Oh?" said Professor Quirrell, leaning back in his chair in a
casual and relaxed manner. "Protest away, Mr. Malfoy."</p>
<p>"Granger is unfit for the position," said Draco.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell tapped a finger on his cheek thoughtfully.
"Why yes, yes she is. Do you have any further protests?"</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell," said Harry Potter beside him, "with all
due respect to Miss Granger's many outstanding academic talents and
the Quirrell points she has justly earned in your classes, her
personality is not suited to military command."</p>
<p>Draco had been relieved when Harry had agreed to accompany him
to Professor Quirrell's office. It wasn't <em>just</em> that Harry
was a gigantic blatant teacher's pet where Professor Quirrell was
concerned. Draco had also started to worry that Harry actually
<em>was</em> friends with Granger, it had been a while now and he
<em>still</em> hadn't made his move... but this was more like
it.</p>
<p>"I agree with Mr. Potter," said Draco. "Appointing her as a
general turns it into a farce."</p>
<p>"Harshly put," said Harry, "but I cannot bring myself to
disagree with Mr. Malfoy. To be blunt, Professor Quirrell, Hermione
Granger has around as much intent to kill as a bowl of wet
grapes."</p>
<p>"That," said Professor Quirrell mildly, "is not a thing I would
fail to notice myself. You are telling me nothing I do not already
know."</p>
<p>It was Draco's turn to say something, but the conversation had
suddenly hiccupped. That answer had <em>not</em> been in the
possibilities he and Harry had brainstormed before coming here.
What <em>did</em> you say after the teacher said that he knew
everything you knew and he was still going to commit an obvious
mistake?</p>
<p>The silence stretched.</p>
<p>"Is this some sort of plot?" Harry said slowly.</p>
<p>"Must everything I do be some sort of plot?" said Professor
Quirrell. "Can't I ever create chaos just for the sake of
chaos?"</p>
<p>Draco almost choked.</p>
<p>"Not in your Battle Magic class," Harry said with calm
certainty. "Other places, maybe, but not there."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell slowly raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p>Harry gazed steadily back at him.</p>
<p>Draco shivered.</p>
<p>"Well then," Professor Quirrell said. "Neither of you seem to
have considered a very simple question. Who could I appoint instead
of Miss Granger?"</p>
<p>"Blaise Zabini," Draco said without hesitation.</p>
<p>"Any other suggestions?" said Professor Quirrell, sounding quite
amused.</p>
<p><em>Anthony Goldstein and Ernie Macmillan,</em> came the
thought, before Draco's common sense kicked in and ruled out
mudbloods and Hufflepuffs no matter how aggressively they dueled.
So instead Draco just said, "What's wrong with Zabini?"</p>
<p>"I <em>see</em>..." Harry said slowly.</p>
<p>"I <em>don't,</em>" said Draco. "Why not Zabini?"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell looked at Draco. "Because, Mr. Malfoy, no
matter how hard he tries, he'll never be able to keep up with you
or Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>The shock of it staggered Draco. "You can't believe
<em>Granger</em> is going to -"</p>
<p>"He's gambling on her," Harry said quietly. "It's not
guaranteed. The odds aren't even good. She'll probably never give
us a good fight, and even if she does, it may take her months to
learn. But she's the only one in our year with any chance at all of
growing to beat us."</p>
<p>Draco's hands twitched but didn't clench into fists. Showing up
as your supporter and then backing out was a classic undermining
tactic, so Harry Potter <em>was</em> in it with Granger and
<em>that</em> implied -</p>
<p>"But Professor," Harry went on smoothly, "I'm worried Hermione
will be <em>miserable</em> as the general of an army. I'm speaking
as her friend now, Professor Quirrell. The competition might be
good for Draco and me, but what you're asking her to do isn't good
for <em>her!</em> "</p>
<p>Never mind.</p>
<p>"Your friendship for Hermione Granger does you credit,"
Professor Quirrell said dryly. "Especially as you are able to be
friends with Draco Malfoy at the same time. Quite a feat,
that."</p>
<p>Harry suddenly looked a little nervous, meaning he probably felt
a lot <em>more</em> nervous, and Draco silently swore to himself.
Of course Harry wasn't going to fool Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>"And I doubt Miss Granger would appreciate your friendly
concern," said Professor Quirrell. "She asked me for the position,
Mr. Potter, I did not ask her."</p>
<p>Harry was quiet at this for a moment. Then he flashed Draco a
quick look that mixed apology and warning, saying at the same time,
<em>Sorry, I did my best</em> and <em>We'd better not press it any
further.</em></p>
<p>"As for her being miserable," Professor Quirrell went on, a
slight smile now playing about his lips, "I suspect that she will
have a much easier time with the rigors of her position than either
of you suspect, and that she will put up a good fight much sooner
than you think."</p>
<p>Harry and Draco both gasped in horror.</p>
<p>"You're not going to <em>advise</em> her, are you?" said Draco,
utterly aghast.</p>
<p>"I never signed up to fight <em>you!</em> " said Harry.</p>
<p>The smile playing around Professor Quirrell's lips grew wider.
"As a matter of fact, I <em>did</em> offer to share a few
suggestions regarding Miss Granger's first battles."</p>
<p>"<em>Professor Quirrell!</em> " said Harry.</p>
<p>"Oh, don't worry," Professor Quirrell said. "She turned me down.
Just as I expected."</p>
<p>Draco's eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>"Dear me, Mr. Potter," said Professor Quirrell, "didn't anyone
ever tell you it's rude to stare?"</p>
<p>"You're not going to secretly help her some <em>other</em> way,
are you?" said Harry.</p>
<p>"Would I do that?" said Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Draco and Harry at the same time.</p>
<p>"I am wounded by your lack of trust. Well then, I promise not to
help General Granger in any way that the two of you don't know
about. And now I suggest that both of you be about your military
affairs. November approaches, and swiftly."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Draco saw the implications before the door had closed all the
way behind them on their way out of Professor Quirrell's
office.</p>
<p>Harry had once spoken dismissively of "people stuff".</p>
<p>And now that was Draco's only hope.</p>
<p>Let him not realize, let him not realize...</p>
<p>"We should just attack the Granger girl first and get her out of
our way," said Draco. "After we crush her, we can have our own
contest without any distractions."</p>
<p>"Now that doesn't really seem fair to her, does it?" said Harry
in a mild voice.</p>
<p>"What do <em>you</em> care?" said Draco. "She's your rival,
right?" Then, with just the right note of suspicion in his voice,
"Don't tell me you've started <em>really</em> liking her, after
being her rival all this time..."</p>
<p>"Founders forbid," said Harry. "What can I say, Draco? I merely
have a natural sense of justice. Granger does too, you know. She
has a very firm grasp on good and evil, and she's probably going to
attack evil first. Having a name like 'Malfoy' is just asking for
it, you know."</p>
<p><em>DAMN IT!</em></p>
<p>"Harry," said Draco, sounding wounded and maybe a little
superior, "don't you want to fight <em>fairly</em> against me?"</p>
<p>"You mean rather than attacking you after you've already lost
some of your forces beating Granger?" said Harry. "Oh, I don't
know. Maybe after I get bored with just winning I'll try that
'fair' thing."</p>
<p>"Maybe she'll attack <em>you,</em>" Draco said. "<em>You're</em>
her rival."</p>
<p>"But I'm her <em>friendly</em> rival," Harry said with an evil
grin. "I bought her a nice birthday present and everything. You
wouldn't go around sabotaging your friendly rival like that."</p>
<p>"What about sabotaging your <em>friend's</em> chance at a fair
fight?" said Draco angrily. "I thought we were friends!"</p>
<p>"Let me rephrase that," said Harry. "<em>Granger</em> wouldn't
sabotage a friendly rival. But that's because she has the killing
intention of a bowl of wet grapes. <em>You</em> would. You
<em>totally</em> would. And guess what, so would I."</p>
<p><em>DAMN IT!</em></p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>If it had been a play, there would have been dramatic music.</p>
<p>The hero, impeccably turned out in green-trimmed robes and
perfectly combed white-blonde hair, faced the villain.</p>
<p>The villain, leaning back in a simple wooden chair with her
buckteeth clearly visible and stray chestnut curls drifting over
her cheeks, faced the hero.</p>
<p>It was Wednesday, October 30th, and the first battle was coming
up on Sunday.</p>
<p>Draco was standing in General Granger's office, a room the size
of a small classroom. (<em>Why</em> each general's office was so
large, Draco wasn't quite sure. A chair and a desk would have
worked for him. He wasn't even clear on why the generals needed
offices at all, his soldiers knew where to find him. Unless
Professor Quirrell had deliberately arranged the huge offices for
them as a sign of status, in which case Draco was all for it.)</p>
<p>Granger sat on the room's single chair like a throne, all the
way on the other end of the office from where the door opened.
There was a long oblong table stretched across the middle of the
room between them, and four small circular tables scattered around
the corners, but only that one single chair, all the way at the
opposite end. The room had windows along one wall, and one beam of
sunlight touched the top of Granger's hair like a glowing
crown.</p>
<p>It would have been nice if Draco could have walked slowly
forward. But there was a table in the way, and Draco had to go
around it diagonally, and there was no good way to do that in a
dramatic and dignified fashion. Had that been deliberate? If it had
been his father, it surely would have been; but this was Granger,
so surely not.</p>
<p>There was nowhere for him to sit, and Granger hadn't stood up,
either.</p>
<p>Draco kept the outrage entirely off his face.</p>
<p>"Well, Mr. Draco Malfoy," Granger said once he stood before her,
"you requested an audience with me and I have been so gracious as
to grant it. What was your plea?"</p>
<p><em>Come with me to visit Malfoy Manor, my father and I would
like to show you some interesting spells.<br></em></p>
<p>"Your rival, Potter, came to me with an offer," said Draco,
putting a serious look on his face. "He doesn't mind losing to me,
but would be humiliated if you won. So he wants to join with me and
wipe you out immediately, not just in our first battle, all of
them. If I won't do that, Potter wants me to hold back or harass
you, while he launches an all-out attack on you as his first
move."</p>
<p>"I see," Granger said, looking surprised. "And you're offering
to help me against him?"</p>
<p>"Of course," said Draco smoothly. "I didn't think what he wanted
to do to you was fair."</p>
<p>"Why, that's very nice of you, Mr. Malfoy," said Granger. "I'm
sorry for how I spoke to you earlier. We should be friends. Can I
call you Drakey?"</p>
<p>Alarm bells started to sound in Draco's head, but there was a
<em>chance</em> she meant it...</p>
<p>"Of course," said Draco, "if I can call you Hermy."</p>
<p>Draco was pretty sure he saw her expression flicker.</p>
<p>"Anyway," Draco said, "I was thinking it would serve Potter
right if we both attacked him and wiped him out."</p>
<p>"But that wouldn't be fair to Mr. Potter, would it?" said
Granger.</p>
<p>"I think it'd be very fair," Draco said. "He was planning to do
it to you first."</p>
<p>Granger was giving him a stern look that could possibly have
intimidated him if he'd been a Hufflepuff instead of a Malfoy. "You
think I'm pretty stupid, don't you, Mr. Malfoy?"</p>
<p>Draco smiled charmingly. "No, Miss Granger, but I thought I'd at
least <em>check.</em> So, what do you want?"</p>
<p>"Are you offering to <em>bribe</em> me?" said Granger.</p>
<p>"Sure," said Draco. "Can I just slip you a Galleon and have you
beat on Potter instead of me for the rest of the year?"</p>
<p>"Nope," said Granger, "but you can offer me ten Galleons and
have me attack both of you equally, instead of just you."</p>
<p>"Ten Galleons is a lot of money," Draco said cautiously.</p>
<p>"I didn't know the Malfoys were poor," said Granger.</p>
<p>Draco stared at Granger.</p>
<p>He was starting to get a strange feeling about this.</p>
<p>That particular reply didn't seem like it should have come from
this particular girl.</p>
<p>"Well," said Draco, "you don't get to be rich by wasting money,
you know."</p>
<p>"I don't know if you know what a dentist is, Mr. Malfoy, but my
parents are <em>dentists</em> and anything less than ten Galleons
isn't worth my time at all."</p>
<p>"Three Galleons," Draco said, more as a probe than anything
else.</p>
<p>"Nope," said Granger. "If you want an equal fight at all, I
don't believe that a Malfoy wants an equal fight less than he wants
ten Galleons."</p>
<p>Draco was starting to get a <em>very</em> strange feeling about
this.</p>
<p>"No," said Draco.</p>
<p>"No?" said Granger. "This is a limited time offer, Mr. Malfoy.
Are you sure you want to risk a whole year of being miserably
crushed by the Boy-Who-Lived? That would be pretty embarrassing for
the House of Malfoy, wouldn't it?"</p>
<p>It was a very persuasive argument, one that was hard to refuse,
but you didn't get to be rich by spending money when your heart
told you it was a setup.</p>
<p>"No," said Draco.</p>
<p>"See you on Sunday," said Granger.</p>
<p>Draco turned and walked out of the office without another
word.</p>
<p>That had been <em>not right...</em></p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"Hermione," Harry said patiently, "we're <em>supposed</em> to be
plotting against each other. You could even betray me and it
wouldn't mean anything outside the battlefield."</p>
<p>Hermione shook her head. "It wouldn't be nice, Harry."</p>
<p>Harry sighed. "I don't think you're getting into the spirit of
this at all."</p>
<p><em>It wouldn't be nice.</em> She'd actually said that. Hermione
didn't know whether to be insulted at what Harry thought of her, or
worried about whether she really <em>did</em> sound like that much
of a goody-two-shoes usually.</p>
<p>It was probably time to change the subject.</p>
<p>"Anyway, are you doing anything special for tomorrow?" said
Hermione. "It's -"</p>
<p>Her voice cut off abruptly as she realized.</p>
<p>"Yes, Hermione," Harry said a little tightly, "what day is
it?"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Interlude:</em></p>
<p>There was a time when October 31st had been called Halloween in
magical Britain.</p>
<p>Now it was Harry Potter Day.</p>
<p>Harry had turned down all the offers, even the one from Minister
Fudge which might have been good for future political favors and
which he <em>really</em> should have gritted his teeth and taken.
But to Harry, October 31st would always be The Dark Lord Killed My
Parents Day. There should have been a quiet, dignified memorial
service somewhere, and if there was one, he hadn't been
invited.</p>
<p>Hogwarts got the day off to celebrate. Even the Slytherins
didn't dare wear black outside their own dorm. There were special
events and special foods and the teachers looked the other way if
anyone ran through the hallways. It was the tenth anniversary,
after all.</p>
<p>Harry spent the day in his trunk so as not to spoil it for
anyone else, eating snack bars in place of meals, reading some of
his sadder science fiction books (no fantasy), and writing a letter
to Mum and Dad that was much longer than the ones he usually
sent.</p>

<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The day was Sunday, November 3rd, and soon the three great
powers of their school year, Harry Potter, Draco Malfoy, and
Hermione Granger, would begin their struggle for supreme
dominance.</p>
<p>(Harry was slightly annoyed by the way the Boy-Who-Lived had
been demoted from supreme dominance to one of three equal rivals
just by entering the contest, but he expected to get it back
soon.)</p>
<p>The battleground was a section of non-Forbidden forest, dense
with trees, because Professor Quirrell thought that being able to
see all the enemy forces was too boring even for your very first
battle.</p>
<p>All the students who were not actually <em>in</em> a first-year
army were camped out nearby and watching on screens that Professor
Quirrell had set up. Except for three Gryffindors in their fourth
year, who were currently sick and confined to healer's beds by
Madam Pomfrey. Aside from that, everyone was there.</p>
<p>The students were dressed, not in their ordinary school robes,
but in Muggle camouflage uniforms that Professor Quirrell had
obtained somewhere and supplied in sufficient quantity and variety
to fit everyone. It wasn't that students would have worried about
stains and rips, that was what Charms were for. But as Professor
Quirrell had explained to the surprised wizardborns, nice dignified
clothing was not efficient for hiding in forests or dodging around
trees.</p>
<p>And on each uniform's breast, a patch bearing the name and
insignia of your army. A <em>small</em> patch. If you wanted your
soldiers to wear, say, colored ribbons so that they could identify
each other at a distance, and risk the enemy getting their hands on
the ribbons, that was all up to you.</p>
<p>Harry had tried to get the name Dragon Army.</p>
<p>Draco had pitched a fit and said that would confuse everyone
completely.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell had ruled that Draco could lay prior claim to
the name, if he wished.</p>
<p>So now Harry was fighting Dragon Army.</p>
<p>This probably wasn't a good sign.</p>
<p>For their insignia, instead of the too-obvious dragon's head
breathing fire, Draco had elected to simply go with the fire.
Elegant, understated, deadly: <em>This is what's left after we've
passed.</em> Very Malfoy.</p>
<p>Harry, after considering alternate choices such as the 501st
Provisional Battalion and Harry's Minions o' Doom, had decided that
his army would be known by the simple and dignified appellation of
the Chaos Legion.</p>
<p>Their insignia was a hand poised with fingers ready to snap.</p>
<p>It was <em>universally</em> agreed that this wasn't a good
sign.</p>
<p>Harry had earnestly advised Hermione that the young boys serving
under her were probably nervous about her being a girl with a
reputation for being nice, and that she should pick something scary
that would reassure them of her toughness and make them proud to be
part of her army, like the Blood Commandos or something.</p>
<p>Hermione had named her army the Sunshine Regiment.</p>
<p>Their insignia was a smiley face.</p>
<p>And in ten minutes, they would be at war.</p>
<p>Harry stood in the bright forest clearing that was their
assigned starting location, an area of open space with old and
rotting tree stumps that had been cleared away for some unknown
purpose, ground coated with a small scattering of blown leaves and
the dried grey remnants of grass that had failed the test of
summer's heat, and the sun shining down brilliantly from above.</p>
<p>Around him were the twenty-three soldiers that Professor
Quirrell had assigned to him. Nearly all of Gryffindor had signed
up, of course, and more than half of Slytherin, and less than half
of Hufflepuff, and a handful of Ravenclaw. In Harry's army there
were twelve Gryffindors and six Slytherins and four Hufflepuffs and
one Ravenclaw besides himself... not that there was any way to tell
that by looking at the uniforms. No red, no green, no yellow, no
blue. Just Muggle camouflage patterns, and a patch on the breast
with the device of a hand poised to snap its fingers.</p>
<p>Harry looked upon his twenty-three soldiers, all wearing the
same uniforms with no marks of group identity save that single
patch.</p>
<p>And lo, Harry smiled, because he understood what this part of
Professor Quirrell's master plan was about; and Harry was taking
full advantage of it for his <em>own</em> purposes, too.</p>
<p>There was a legendary episode in social psychology called the
Robbers Cave experiment. It had been set up in the bewildered
aftermath of World War II, with the intent of investigating the
causes and remedies of conflicts between groups. The scientists had
set up a summer camp for 22 boys from 22 different schools,
selecting them to all be from stable middle-class families. The
first phase of the experiment had been intended to investigate what
it took to <em>start</em> a conflict between groups. The 22 boys
had been divided into two groups of 11 -</p>
<p>- and this had been quite sufficient.</p>
<p>The hostility had started from the moment the two groups had
become aware of each others' existences in the state park, insults
being hurled on the first meeting. They'd named themselves the
Eagles and the Rattlers (they hadn't needed names for themselves
when they thought they were the only ones in the park) and had
proceeded to develop contrasting group stereotypes, the Rattlers
thinking of themselves as rough-and-tough and swearing heavily, the
Eagles correspondingly deciding to think of themselves as
upright-and-proper.</p>
<p>The other part of the experiment had been testing how to resolve
group conflicts. Bringing the boys together to watch fireworks
hadn't worked at all. They'd just shouted at each other and stayed
apart. What <em>had</em> worked was warning them that there might
be vandals in the park, and the two groups needing to work together
to solve a failure of the park's water system. A common task, a
common enemy.</p>
<p>Harry had a strong suspicion Professor Quirrell had understood
this principle very well indeed when he had chosen to create
<em>three</em> armies per year.</p>
<p><em>Three</em> armies.</p>
<p>Not <em>four</em>.</p>
<p>And definitely <em>not</em> segregated by House... except that
no Slytherins had been assigned to Draco besides Mr. Crabbe and Mr.
Goyle.</p>
<p>It was things like this which reassured Harry that Professor
Quirrell, despite his affected Dark atmosphere and his pretense of
neutrality in the conflict between Good and Evil, was secretly
backing Good, not that Harry would ever dare say that out loud.</p>
<p>And Harry had decided to take full advantage of Professor
Quirrell's plan to define a group identity <em>his</em> way.</p>
<p>The Rattlers, once they'd met the Eagles, had started thinking
of themselves as rough-and-tough, and they'd conducted themselves
accordingly.</p>
<p>The Eagles had thought of themselves as good-and-proper.</p>
<p>And in that bright forest clearing, scattered around the old and
rotting tree stumps, outlined in the sun shining down brilliantly
from above, General Potter and his twenty-three soldiers were
arranged in nothing remotely resembling a formation. Some soldiers
stood, some soldiers sat, some stood on one leg just to be
different.</p>
<p>It was the <em>Chaos</em> Legion, after all.</p>
<p>And if there wasn't a <em>reason</em> to stand in neat little
lines, Harry had said disdainfully, there weren't going to be neat
little lines.</p>
<p>Harry had divided the army into 6 squads of 4 soldiers each,
each squad commanded by a Squad Suggester. All troops were under
strict orders to disobey any orders they were given if it seemed
like a good idea at the time, including that one... unless Harry or
the Squad Suggester prefixed the order with "Merlin says", in which
case you were supposed to actually obey.</p>
<p>The Chaos Legion's chief attack was to split up and run in from
multiple directions, randomly changing vectors and firing the
approved sleep spell as rapidly as you could rebuild the magical
strength. And if you saw a chance to distract or confuse the enemy,
you took it.</p>
<p>Fast. Creative. Unpredictable. Non-homogenous. Don't just obey
orders, think about whether what you're doing <em>right now</em>
makes sense.</p>
<p>Harry wasn't quite as sure as he'd pretended that this was the
optimum of military efficiency... but he'd been given a golden
opportunity to change how some students <em>thought about
themselves,</em> and that was how he intended to use it.</p>
<p>Five minutes to wartime, according to Harry's watch.</p>
<p>General Potter walked (not marched) over to where his air force
was waiting tensely, broomsticks already clutched firmly in their
hands.</p>
<p>"All wings report in," said General Potter. They'd rehearsed
this during their one training session on Saturday.</p>
<p>"Red Leader standing by," said Seamus Finnigan, who had no idea
what it meant.</p>
<p>"Red Five standing by," said Dean Thomas, who'd waited his
entire life to say it.</p>
<p>"Green Leader standing by," Theodore Nott said rather
stiffly.</p>
<p>"Green Forty-One standing by," Tracey Davis said.</p>
<p>"I want you in the air the instant we hear the bell," said
General Potter. "Do not engage, repeat, do not engage. Evade if
under fire." (Of course you did <em>not</em> aim sleep spells at
broomsticks; you fired a spell that gave a temporary red glow to
whatever it hit. If you hit the broomstick or the rider, they were
out of the war.) "Red Leader and Red Five, fly toward Malfoy's army
as fast as you can, stay as high as you can while still seeing
them, return the instant you know for sure what they're doing.
Green Leader, do the same for Granger's army. Green Forty-One, fly
above us and watch for any approaching broomsticks or soldiers, you
and only you are authorized to fire. And remember, I didn't say
'Merlin says' for any of that, but we <em>do</em> really need the
information. For Chaos!"</p>
<p>"For Chaos!" the four echoed with varying degrees of
enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Harry expected Hermione to launch an immediate attack on Draco,
in which case he'd move his troops into position and start
supporting her, but only after she'd taken severe losses and caused
some damage. He would frame it as a heroic rescue, if possible; it
wouldn't do to have Sunshine thinking that Chaos wasn't their
friend, after all.</p>
<p>But just in case she <em>didn't</em>... well, that was why the
Chaos Legion was staying put until Green Leader reported back.</p>
<p>Draco's moves would be in his own self-interest. He would
predictably ready his army to defend against Hermione; he might or
might not realize that Harry had been lying about waiting to attack
until after that battle finished. Harry had still put two
broomsticks on Dragon Army, just in case they <em>were</em> doing
something, and just in case Draco or Mr. Goyle or Mr. Crabbe was
good enough to shoot a broomstick out of the sky.</p>
<p>But General Granger was the unpredictable one, and Harry
couldn't move until he knew how she was moving.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>In the heart of the forest, with shadow patterns dancing on the
ground as leafy canopies swayed high above, General Malfoy stood
where the trees were relatively sparser, and looked out on his
troops with calm satisfaction. Six units of three troops each, the
Aerial Unit of four (to which Gregory was assigned), and the
Command Unit, which was himself and Vincent. They'd only drilled
for a short time on the previous Saturday, but Draco was confident
that he'd managed to explain the basics. Stay with your mates,
watch their back and trust them to watch yours. Move as a single
body. Obey orders and show no fear. Aim, fire, move, aim again,
fire again.</p>
<p>The six units were formed up in a defensive perimeter around
Draco, watchfully gazing outward into the forest. Back-to-back they
stood, wands gripped low until they needed to strike.</p>
<p>They already looked remarkably like the Auror units whose
training Draco had watched during his father's inspections.</p>
<p>Chaos and Sunshine weren't going to know what hit them.</p>
<p>"Attention," said General Malfoy.</p>
<p>The six units unfolded and spun toward Draco; the faces of his
broomstick riders turned from where they stood with broomsticks
already in hand.</p>
<p>Draco had decided to wait on demanding salutes until after they
won their first battle, when Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs would be
more willing to salute a Malfoy.</p>
<p>But his soldiers were already standing straight enough,
especially the Gryffindors, that Draco wondered if he'd even needed
to delay. Gregory had quietly listened, and reported back that
Draco's volunteering to stand by Harry Potter in Defense class,
that time when Professor Quirrell had taught Harry how to lose, had
marked Draco as an acceptable commander. At least if you happened
to be assigned to his army. <em>Not all Slytherins are alike; there
are Slytherins, and then there are Slytherins</em> was what the
Gryffindors in Draco's army were quoting to their Housemates.</p>
<p>Draco was frankly <em>astounded</em> at how incredibly
<em>easy</em> that had been. Draco had protested at first about not
being assigned any Slytherins, and Professor Quirrell had told him
that if he wanted to be the first Malfoy to gain complete political
control of the country, he needed to learn how to govern the other
three-quarters of the population. It was things like this which
reassured Draco that Professor Quirrell had a great deal more
sympathy for the good guys than Professor Quirrell was letting
on.</p>
<p>The actual battle wouldn't be easy, especially if Granger did
attack the Dragons first. Draco had agonized over whether to commit
all his forces against Granger immediately in a preemptive strike,
but had worried that (1) Harry had been misleading him completely
about what Granger was likely to do, and (2) Harry had been
misleading him about waiting until after Granger's attack to join
the battle.</p>
<p>Though Dragon Army had a secret weapon, three of them in fact,
which might be enough to win even if they were attacked by both
armies at once...</p>
<p>It was almost time, and that meant it was time for the
pre-battle speech that Draco had composed and memorized.</p>
<p>"The battle is about to begin," Draco said. His voice was calm
and precise. "Remember everything that I and Mr. Crabbe and Mr.
Goyle showed you. An army wins because it is disciplined and
deadly. General Potter and the Chaos Legion will not be
disciplined. Granger and the Sunshine Regiment will not be deadly.
We are disciplined, we are deadly, we are Dragons. The battle is
about to begin, and we are about to win it."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>(Ex tempore speech given by General Potter to the Chaos
Legion, immediately before their first battle, on November 3rd,
1991, at 2:56pm:)</em></p>
<p>My troops, I'm not going to lie to you, our situation today is
very grim. Dragon Army has never lost a single battle. And Hermione
Granger... has a very good memory. The truth is, most of you are
probably going to die. And the survivors will envy the dead. But we
have to win this. We have to win this so that someday, our children
can enjoy the taste of chocolate again. Everything is at stake
here. Literally everything. If we lose, the whole universe just
blinks out like a light bulb. And now I realize that most of you
don't know what a light bulb is. Well, take it from me, it's bad.
But if we have to go down, let's go down fighting, like heroes, so
that as the darkness closes in, we can think to ourselves, <em>at
least we had fun.</em> Are you afraid to die? I know I am. I can
feel those cold shivers of fear like someone is pumping ice cream
into my shirt. But I know... that history is watching us. It was
watching us when we changed into our uniforms. It was probably
taking pictures. And history, my troops, is written by the victors.
If we win this, we can write our own history. A history in which
Hogwarts was founded by four renegade house elves. We can make
everyone study that history, even though it isn't true, and if they
don't answer the right way on our tests... they'll fail the class.
Isn't that worth dying for? No, don't answer that. Some things are
better left unknown. None of us know why we're here. None of us
know why we're fighting. We just woke up in these uniforms in this
mysterious forest, knowing only that there was no way to get our
names and memories back except victory. The students in those other
armies out there... they're just like us. They don't want to die.
They're fighting to protect each other, the only friends they have
left. They're fighting because they know they have families who'll
miss them, even if they can't remember now. They may even be
fighting to save the world. But we have a better reason to fight
than they do. We fight because we like it. We fight to amuse
eldritch monstrosities from beyond Space and Time. We fight because
we're Chaos. Soon the final battle will begin, so let me say now,
because I won't get a chance later, that it was an honor to be your
commander, however briefly. Thank you, thank you all. And remember,
your goal isn't just to cut down the enemy, it's to make them
afraid.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>A great booming gong echoed over the forest.</p>
<p>And the Sunshine Regiment began to march.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The tension rose and rose, as Harry and the nineteen other
soldiers who remained waited for the aerial warriors to report
back. It shouldn't take long, broomsticks were fast and the
distances in the forest were not great -</p>
<p>Two broomsticks approached, at speed, from the direction of
Draco's camp, and all the soldiers tensed. They weren't executing
the maneuvers that were today's code for a <em>friendly</em>
broomstick.</p>
<p>"<em>Scatter and fire!</em> " roared General Potter, and then
suited action to words, scurrying off at top speed toward the
forest cover; and then as soon as Harry was among the trees, he
spun back, raised his wand, tried to seek out the broomstick in the
sky -</p>
<p>"Clear!" shouted a voice. "They're heading back!"</p>
<p>Harry gave a mental shrug. There'd been no way to prevent Draco
from obtaining that information, and he'd only learn that they'd
been standing still.</p>
<p>And the Chaotics slowly emerged from the forest -</p>
<p>"Broomstick approaching from Granger's direction!" yelled
another voice. "I think it's Green Leader, he did the dip and
roll!"</p>
<p>Moments later Theodore Nott dived out of the sky and pulled up
in the midst of the soldiers.</p>
<p>"Granger has divided her forces in two!" yelled Nott as he
hovered on his broomstick. There was sweat staining his uniform,
and all the reserve was gone from his voice. "She's attacking both
armies! Two brooms covering each force, they pursued me halfway
here!"</p>
<p><em>Divided her army, what on Earth -</em></p>
<p>A large force concentrating fire on a small force could deplete
that force rapidly without taking much damage in return. If twenty
soldiers faced ten soldiers, twenty sleep spells would be aimed at
the ten soldiers with only ten sleep spells going the other way, so
unless every one of those first sleep spells hit its target, the
smaller force would lose more people than they could manage to take
down with them. <em>Defeated in detail</em> was the military term
for what happened when you divided your forces like that. What
could Hermione <em>possibly</em> be thinking...</p>
<p>Then Harry realized.</p>
<p><em>She's being fair.</em></p>
<p>It was going to be a long year in Defense class.</p>
<p>"All right," Harry said loudly, so the army could hear. "We'll
wait until the Red Wing reports in, and then we'll go cloud up some
Sunshine."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Draco listened to the flyers' reports with his face calm, all
his shock concealed inside. What could Granger <em>possibly</em> be
thinking?</p>
<p>Then Draco realized.</p>
<p><em>It's a feint.</em></p>
<p>One of Sunshine's two forces would change direction, and both
would converge on... who?</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Neville Longbottom marched through the forest toward the
approaching Sunny force, occasionally glancing up at the sky for
broomsticks. Beside him marched his squad comrades, Melvin Coote
and Lavender Brown of Gryffindor, and Allen Flint of Slytherin.
Allen Flint was their Squad Suggester, though Harry had first said
to Neville, in private, that the position was his if he wanted
it.</p>
<p>Harry had said quite a lot of things to Neville in private,
starting with "You know, Neville, if you want to become as awesome
as the imaginary Neville who lives in your head but isn't allowed
to do anything because you're scared, then you really should sign
up for Professor Quirrell's armies."</p>
<p>Neville was now <em>sure</em> the Boy-Who-Lived could read
minds. There was just no other way Harry Potter could've known.
Neville had never talked about that with <em>anyone</em>, or given
any sign; and <em>other</em> people weren't like that, not that
Neville had ever noticed.</p>
<p>And Harry's promise had come true, this <em>did</em> feel
different from sparring in Defense class. Neville had hoped that
sparring would fix everything that was wrong with him, and, well,
it hadn't. Even if he could fire a few spells at another student in
class with Professor Quirrell watching to make sure nothing went
wrong, even if he could dodge and fire back when it was
<em>allowed</em> and everyone else was <em>expecting</em> it and
they would stare at him funny if he <em>didn't</em> do it, none of
that was the same as being able to stand up for himself.</p>
<p>But being part of an <em>army...</em></p>
<p>Something strange was stirring inside Neville, as he marched
through the forest alongside his comrades, upon their uniforms an
insignia of fingers poised to snap.</p>
<p>He was allowed to walk if he wanted to, but he just felt like
marching.</p>
<p>Beside him, Melvin and Lavender and Allen all seemed to feel
like marching too.</p>
<p>And Neville softly began to sing the Song of Chaos.</p>
<p>The tune was what a Muggle would have identified as John
Williams's Imperial March, also known as "Darth Vader's Theme"; and
the words Harry had added were easy to remember.</p>
<p><em>Doom doom doom<br>
Doom doom doom doom doom doom<br>
Doom doom doom<br>
Doom doom doom doom doom doom<br>
DOOM doom DOOM<br>
Doom doom doom-doom-doom doom doom<br>
Doom doom-doom-doom doom doom<br>
Doom doom doom, doom doom doom.</em></p>
<p>By the second line the others had joined in, and soon you could
hear the same soft chant coming from nearby parts of the
forest.</p>
<p>And Neville marched alongside his fellow Chaos
Legionnaires,<br>
strange feelings stirring in his heart,<br>
imagination becoming reality,<br>
as from his lips poured a fearful song of doom.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry stared at the bodies scattered across the forest.
Something inside him felt a bit queasy, and he had to remind
himself hard that they were only sleeping. There were girls among
the fallen, and that made it a lot worse somehow, and he would have
to be careful never to mention that in front of Hermione or the
Aurors would find his remains stuffed into a <em>small</em>
teapot.</p>
<p>Half of Sunshine army hadn't put up much of a fight against all
of Chaos. The nine ground soldiers had run in screaming
inarticulately with Simple Shields raised, circular screens to
protect their faces and chests. But you couldn't fire and hold the
shield at the same time, and Harry's soldiers had simply aimed for
the legs. All but one of the Sunnies had fallen over as soon as the
cries of "<em>Somnium!</em> " filled the air. That last one had
dropped her shield and managed to take out one of Harry's soldiers
before being hit by the second wave of sleep spells (the Sleep Hex
was safe for multiple hits). The two Sunny broomsticks had been
much harder to take down and had accounted for three Chaotics
before being auraed by massed ground fire.</p>
<p>Hermione wasn't among the fallen. Draco must have gotten her and
that was making Harry feel <em>angry</em> on some completely
incomprehensible level, he wasn't sure if he was feeling protective
toward Hermione, or cheated that he hadn't been the one to do it,
or maybe <em>both.</em></p>
<p>"All right," Harry said, raising his voice. "Let's everyone be
clear on one thing, that wasn't a real fight. That was General
Granger making a mistake in her first battle. Today's actual fight
is with Dragon Army and it's not going to be anything like this.
It's going to be a lot more fun. Let's move out."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>A broomstick fell out of the sky, approaching terrifyingly fast,
and spun on its end and decelerated so hard you could almost hear
the air screaming in protest, and came to a halt directly beside
Draco.</p>
<p>It wasn't dangerous showing-off. Gregory Goyle simply
<em>was</em> that good and he didn't waste time.</p>
<p>"Potter's coming," Gregory said with no trace of his usual fake
drawl. "They've still got all four of their brooms, you want me to
take them out?"</p>
<p>"No," Draco said sharply. "Fighting over their army gives them
too much of an advantage, they'll fire on you from the ground and
even you might not be able to dodge it all. Wait until the forces
engage."</p>
<p>Draco had lost four Dragons in exchange for twelve Sunnies.
Apparently General Granger actually <em>had</em> been that
incredibly stupid, though she hadn't been among the attackers, so
Draco hadn't gotten a chance to taunt her or ask her what in
Merlin's name she had been thinking.</p>
<p>The true battle, they all knew, would be with Harry Potter.</p>
<p>"Prepare yourselves!" roared Draco at his troops. "Stay together
with your mates, act as a unit, fire as soon as the enemy is in
range!"</p>
<p>Discipline against Chaos.</p>
<p>It shouldn't be much of a fight.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The adrenaline was pumping and pumping into Neville's blood
until he felt like he could hardly breathe.</p>
<p>"We're closing in," said General Potter in a voice barely loud
enough to carry to the whole army. "Time to spread out."</p>
<p>Neville's comrades moved away from him. They would still support
each other, but if you clustered together, the enemy would have a
much easier time hitting you; fire aimed at one of your comrades
might miss and get you instead. You would be a lot harder to hit if
you spread out and moved as fast as you could.</p>
<p>The first thing General Potter had done, during their training
session, was get them to fire on each other when both sides were
running fast, or both stood still and took time to aim, or one was
moving and one was standing still - the reverse charm to the Sleep
Hex was simple, though you weren't allowed to use it during real
battles. General Potter had carefully recorded everything that
happened, done some figuring and ciphering, and then announced that
it made more sense for them to focus, not on slowing down to aim
carefully, but on moving fast so they wouldn't get hit.</p>
<p>It still bothered Neville a little not to be marching
side-by-side with his comrades, but the scary battlecries they'd
learned were already thundering in his head and that made up for a
lot.</p>
<p>This time, Neville silently vowed to himself, his voice was
absolutely positively not going to squeak.</p>
<p>"Shields up," said General Potter, "power to forward
deflectors."</p>
<p>"<em>Contego,</em>" murmured the army, and the circular screens
sprang into existence before their heads and chests.</p>
<p>A sharp taste filled Neville's mouth. General Potter wouldn't
have ordered them to cast shields unless they were almost in range.
Neville could see the uniformed shapes of Dragons moving through
the dense screens of trees, and the Dragons would be seeing them as
well -</p>
<p>"<em>Attack!</em> " came a cry from the distance, the voice of
Draco Malfoy, and General Potter bellowed, "<em>Charge -</em>"</p>
<p>All the adrenaline in Neville's blood was unleashed, and his
legs took over, sending him flying faster than he'd ever run
before, straight toward the enemy, knowing without needing to look
that all his comrades were doing the same.</p>
<p>"<em>Blood for the blood god!</em> " screamed Neville.
"<em>Skulls for the skull throne! Ia! Shub-Niggurath! The enemy's
gate is sideways!</em> "</p>
<p>There was a soundless impact as a sleep spell wasted itself
against Neville's shield. If there'd been other spells fired, they
hadn't hit.</p>
<p>Neville saw the brief look of fear on Wayne Hopkins's face, as
he stood besides two Gryffindors Neville didn't recognize, and then
-</p>
<p>- Neville dropped the Simple Shield and fired at Wayne -</p>
<p>- missed -</p>
<p>- his racing legs went <em>straight</em> past the enemy grouping
and toward another three Dragons, their wands coming up on him,
their mouths opening -</p>
<p>- not even thinking about it, Neville dived down to the forest
floor just as three voices cried "<em>Somnium!</em> "</p>
<p>It hurt, hard stones and hard twigs digging into Neville as he
rolled, it wasn't as bad as falling off his broomstick but he'd
still hit the ground pretty hard, and then Neville, with sudden
insight, lay still and closed his eyes.</p>
<p>"Stop that!" screamed a voice. "Don't shoot us, we're
Dragons!"</p>
<p>With a flash of glorious satisfaction, Neville realized that
he'd managed to get between two groups of Dragons just as one group
had fired on him. Harry had talked about this as a tactic for
making the enemy afraid to fire, but apparently it worked a bit
better than that.</p>
<p>And not only that, the Dragons believed they'd <em>gotten</em>
him, since they'd seen Neville fall just as they fired.</p>
<p>Neville counted to twenty inside his head, then opened his eyes
a crack.</p>
<p>The three Dragons were very near him, heads spinning rapidly as
cries of "<em>Somnium!</em> " and <em>"Skulls for the skull
throne!</em> " filled the air around them. All three had Simple
Shields up now.</p>
<p>Neville's wand was still in his hand, and it didn't take much
effort to point it at one boy's boots and whisper
"<em>Somnium.</em>"</p>
<p>Neville quickly closed his eyes and relaxed his hand as he heard
the boy fall to the ground.</p>
<p>"<em>Where'd it come from?</em> " screamed Justin
Finch-Fletchley's voice, and Neville heard rustles on the leafy
forest floor, as of two Dragons spinning around looking for an
enemy.</p>
<p>"<em>Reform ranks!</em> " bellowed Malfoy's voice. "<em>To me,
everyone, don't let them scatter you!</em> "</p>
<p>Neville's ears heard the two Dragons actually jump over his
prone body as they ran off.</p>
<p>Neville opened his eyes, pushed himself to his feet a bit
painfully, and then pointed his wand and said the new charm that
General Potter had taught them all. They couldn't do real illusion
spells to confuse the enemy, but even at their age they could -</p>
<p>"<em>Ventriliquo,</em>" whispered Neville, pointing the wand to
one side of Justin and the other boy, and then yelled, "<em>For
Cthulhu and glory!</em> "</p>
<p>Justin and the other boy stopped abruptly, turning their shields
toward where Neville had moved his battlecry, and that was when
multiple cries of "<em>Somnium!</em> " filled the air and the other
boy dropped before Neville was finished aiming.</p>
<p>"<em>The last one's mine!</em> " yelled Neville, and then he
started sprinting straight toward Justin, who'd been mean to him
until the older Hufflepuffs straightened him out. Neville was
surrounded by his comrades and <em>that</em> meant -</p>
<p>"<em>Special attack, Chaotic Leap!</em> " howled Neville as he
ran, and felt his body lighten, then lighten twice again, as his
comrades got their wands turned toward him and quietly cast the
Hover Charm, and Neville raised his left hand and snapped his
fingers and then used his legs to push off the ground as hard as he
could and <em>soared</em> through the air. Sheer shock painted
Justin's face as Neville went <em>over</em> the other boy's shield
and pointed his wand down at the form passing beneath him and cried
"<em>Somnium!</em> "</p>
<p>Because he'd felt like it, that was why.</p>
<p>Neville didn't quite get his feet turned around properly and
rather plowed into the ground as he landed, but two out of three of
the other Chaos Legionnaires had managed to hold their wands on him
throughout and he didn't hit very hard.</p>
<p>And Neville got to his feet, panting. He knew he should be
moving, people were yelling "Somnium!" all over the place -</p>
<p>"<em>I am Neville, the last scion of Longbottom!</em> " screamed
Neville to the sky above, holding his wand pointed straight up as
though to challenge the blazing blue heaven itself, knowing that
nothing after this day would ever be the same again. "<em>Neville
of Chaos! Face me if you da-</em>"</p>
<p>(When Neville woke up afterward, he was told that Dragon Army
had taken this as their cue to counterattack.)</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The girl beside Harry slumped to the ground, taking the shot
meant for him, and he could hear Mr. Goyle's distant gloating laugh
as his broomstick blasted past them, cutting the air so hard it
should have shattered in his wake.</p>
<p>"<em>Luminos!</em> " cried one of the boys next to Harry, who
hadn't been able to rebuild the magical strength fast enough to do
it earlier, and Mr. Goyle dodged it without a pause.</p>
<p>Chaos had only six soldiers left, now, and Dragon Army had two,
and the only problem was that one of those soldiers was invincible,
and the other one was using up three soldiers just to cover him
inside his shield.</p>
<p>They'd lost more soldiers to Mr. Goyle than all the other
Dragons put together, he was weaving and dodging through the air so
fast that no one could hit him, and he could <em>shoot people while
he did that.</em></p>
<p>Harry had thought of all sorts of ways to stop Mr. Goyle but
none of them were <em>safe</em>, even using the Hover Charm to slow
him down (it was a continuous beam and much easier to aim) wouldn't
be safe because he might fall off the broomstick, throwing things
in his way wouldn't be safe, and that was getting harder and harder
to remember as Harry's blood froze over.</p>
<p><em>It's a game. You're not trying to</em> kill <em>him. Don't
throw away all your future plans for a game...</em></p>
<p>Harry could <em>see</em> the pattern, he could <em>see</em> how
Mr. Goyle was weaving, he could <em>see</em> how and when they all
needed to fire in order to create a web of shots that Mr. Goyle
wouldn't be able to dodge, but he just hadn't been able to
<em>explain</em> it fast enough to his soldiers, they couldn't
coordinate their shots well enough, and now they didn't have enough
people left to do it -</p>
<p><em>I refuse to lose, not like this, not my whole army to one
soldier!</em></p>
<p>Mr. Goyle's broomstick turned faster than anything should have
been able to turn and started to angle in toward Harry and his
surviving troops, he could sense the boy beside him tensing,
getting ready to throw himself in front of his general.</p>
<p><em>SCREW THIS.</em></p>
<p>Harry's wand came up, focusing on Mr. Goyle, Harry's mind
visualized the pattern, and Harry's lips opened and his voice
screamed -</p>
<p>
"<em>Luminos</em><em>luminos</em><em>luminos</em><em>luminos</em><em>luminos</em><em>luminos</em><em>luminos</em><em>luminos</em><em>luminos</em><em>luminos</em><em>luminos</em><em>luminos</em><em>-"<br>
</em></p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>When Harry's eyes opened again, he found himself resting in a
comfortable position with his hands folded over his chest, holding
his wand like a fallen hero.</p>
<p>Slowly, Harry sat up. His <em>magic</em> was aching, a strange
sensation but not an entirely unpleasant one, much like the burn
and lethargy that followed hard physical exercise.</p>
<p>"The general's awake!" cried a voice, and Harry blinked and
focused in that direction.</p>
<p>Four of his soldiers held their wands on a shimmering prismatic
hemisphere, and Harry realized that the battle wasn't over.
Right... he hadn't been hit by a Sleep Hex, just exhausted himself,
so when he woke up, he was still in the game.</p>
<p>Harry suspected he was going to get a lecture from
someone-or-other about not exhausting his magic to the point of
unconsciousness over a children's game. But he hadn't hurt Mr.
Goyle when he'd lost his temper, and that was the important
thing.</p>
<p>Then Harry's mind clicked on another implication, and he looked
down at the steel ring on his left hand's pinky finger, and almost
swore out loud when he saw that the tiny diamond was missing and
there was a marshmallow lying on the ground near where he'd
fallen.</p>
<p>He'd sustained that Transfiguration for seventeen days, and
would now need to start over.</p>
<p>Could've been worse. He could've done this fourteen days later,
<em>after</em> Professor McGonagall had approved him to Transfigure
his father's rock. That was one very good lesson to learn the easy
way.</p>
<p><em>Note to self: Always remove ring from finger before
completely exhausting magic.</em></p>
<p>Harry pushed himself up, making rather hard going of it. Using
up your magic didn't exhaust your muscles, but dodging around trees
certainly did.</p>
<p>He staggered over to the iridescent hemisphere that contained
Draco Malfoy, who was holding his wand aloft to sustain the shield,
and smiling coldly at Harry.</p>
<p>"Where's the fifth soldier?" said Harry.</p>
<p>"Um..." said a boy whose name Harry couldn't remember at the
moment. "I fired a Sleep Hex at the shield and it bounced off and
hit Lavender, I mean the angle shouldn't have been right but it
did..."</p>
<p>Draco was smirking inside the shield.</p>
<p>"So let me guess," Harry said, looking Draco directly in the
eyes, "those neat little trios are the formation used by
professional magical militaries? Made up of trained soldiers who
can easily hit moving targets if their own hands are steady, and
who can combine their defensive powers so long as they stay
together? Unlike <em>your</em> soldiers?"</p>
<p>The smirk had vanished from Draco's face, which was now hard and
grim.</p>
<p>"You know," Harry said lightly, knowing that none of the others
would understand the real message passing between them, "it just
goes to show that you should always question everything you see
your role models doing, and ask why it's being done, and whether it
makes sense in context for you to do it too. Don't forget to apply
that advice to real life, by the way. And thanks for the
slow-moving clustered targets."</p>
<p>Because Draco had already gotten that lecture, and, Harry
suspected, discounted it out of suspicion that Harry was trying to
shift his loyalties further away from pureblood tradition. Which of
course Harry <em>was.</em> But this example would make an excellent
excuse, next Saturday, to claim that questioning authority was a
merely practical technique for real life. And Harry would also
mention the experiments he'd run, first with individuals and then
with groups, to check that his ideas about the importance of speed
had actually been <em>correct,</em> by way of hammering home the
point of Draco needing to keep an eye out at all times for chances
to apply the methods in everyday practice.</p>
<p>"You haven't won <em>yet,</em> General Potter!" snarled Draco.
"Maybe we'll run out of time, and Professor Quirrell will call it a
draw."</p>
<p>A fair and worrisome point. The war only ended when Professor
Quirrell, in his personal judgment, decided one army had won by
practical real-world standards. There was no <em>formal</em>
victory condition, Professor Quirrell had explained, because then
Harry would figure out how to game the rules. Harry had to admit
this was a fair cop.</p>
<p>And Harry couldn't blame Professor Quirrell for not calling an
end, because it was plausible that the last soldier of Dragon Army
could take out all five survivors of the Chaos Legion.</p>
<p>"All right," Harry said. "Does anyone know anything about
General Malfoy's shield spell?"</p>
<p>It developed that Draco's shield was a version of the standard
<em>Protego</em> which had several disadvantages, the most
important of which was that the shield couldn't move with the
caster.</p>
<p>The upside - or from Harry's perspective, downside - was that it
was easier to learn, easier to cast, and much easier to sustain for
long times.</p>
<p>They would need to hammer the shield with attack spells in order
to bring it down.</p>
<p>And Draco could apparently exert some control over the angle of
reflection at which the spells would bounce off.</p>
<p>The thought occurred to Harry that they could use Wingardium
Leviosa to pile up heavy rocks on the shield until Draco couldn't
sustain it against the pressure... but then the rocks might fall in
afterward and hit Draco, and injuring the enemy general for real
was not among today's goals.</p>
<p>"So," said Harry. "Are there such things as specialized
shield-piercing spells?"</p>
<p>There were.</p>
<p>Harry asked if any of his soldiers knew them.</p>
<p>No one did.</p>
<p>Draco was smirking again, inside his shield.</p>
<p>Harry asked if there was any sort of attack spell that
<em>wouldn't</em> bounce.</p>
<p>Lightning bolts, it seemed, were usually absorbed by shields
instead of bouncing off them.</p>
<p>...No one knew how to cast any sort of lightning-related
spell.</p>
<p>Draco sniggered.</p>
<p>Harry sighed.</p>
<p>He quite deliberately laid his wand on the ground.</p>
<p>And Harry announced, with some weariness in his voice, that he
would just go ahead and take down the shield himself, using some
method that would remain mysterious; and everyone else was to fire
on Draco as soon as his shield went down.</p>
<p>The Chaos Legionnaires looked nervous.</p>
<p>Draco looked calm, which was to say, controlled.</p>
<p>A thin, folded blanket came out of Harry's pouch.</p>
<p>Harry sat down next to the shimmering shield, and pulled the
blanket over his head so no one could see what he did - except
Draco, of course.</p>
<p>From Harry's pouch came a car battery and a set of jumper
cables.</p>
<p>...it wasn't like he'd been about to leave the Muggle world to
start a new era of magical research, and not take along any way of
generating electricity.</p>
<p>Shortly after, the Chaos Legionnaires heard the sound of fingers
snapping, followed by a crackling noise from beneath the blanket.
The shield started glowing more brightly, and Harry's voice said,
"Don't be distracted please, eyes on General Malfoy."</p>
<p>The strain was showing on Draco's face, along with the fury and
annoyance and frustration.</p>
<p>Harry smiled up at him, and mouthed, <em>Tell you
later.</em></p>
<p>And that was when a spiral of green energy shot out of the
forest and smashed into Draco's shield, which shrieked like pieces
of sharp glass being rubbed together, and Draco staggered.</p>
<p>In sudden, frantic panic, Harry took the jumper cables off the
battery and fed them into the pouch, then he fed the battery itself
into the pouch, and then he tore off the blanket and grabbed his
wand and stood up.</p>
<p>All of his soldiers were still there and glancing around
frantically.</p>
<p>"<em>Contego,</em>" Harry said, and his soldiers followed suit,
but Harry didn't even know which direction the shield ought to be
pointing in. "Did anyone see where that came from?" Shaken heads.
"And General Malfoy, would you mind telling me if <em>you</em> got
General Granger?"</p>
<p>"Why yes," Draco said acidly, "I mind."</p>
<p><em>Oh, hell.</em></p>
<p>Harry's mind began calculating, Draco inside the shield, Draco
worn out now to some degree, Harry worn out too, Hermione in the
woods who-knew-where, Harry and four other Chaotics left...</p>
<p>"You know, General Granger," Harry said out loud, "you really
should've waited to attack until after I'd fought General Malfoy.
You might've been able to get <em>all</em> the survivors."</p>
<p>From somewhere came a girl's high-pitched laughter.</p>
<p>Harry froze.</p>
<p><em>That wasn't Hermione.</em></p>
<p>And that was when the dreadful, eerie, cheerful chant began to
rise, coming from all around them.</p>
<p>"<em>Don't be frightened, don't be sad,<br>
We'll only hurt you if you're bad...</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Granger cheated!</em> " burst out Draco inside the shield.
"She woke up her soldiers! Why doesn't Professor Quirrell -"</p>
<p>"Let me guess," Harry said, the sickness already churning in his
stomach. He really hated losing. "It was a very easy battle, right?
They dropped like flies?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Draco said. "We got them all on the first shot -"</p>
<p>The look of horrified realization spread from Draco to the Chaos
Legionnaires.</p>
<p>"No," Harry said, "we didn't."</p>
<p>Camouflaged forms were appearing from among the trees.</p>
<p>"Allies?" Harry said.</p>
<p>"Allies," Draco said.</p>
<p>"Good," said General Granger's voice, and a spiral of green
energy blazed out of the woods and shattered Draco's shield to
splinters.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>General Granger surveyed the battlefield with a definite feeling
of satisfaction. She was down to nine Sunshine Soldiers, but that
was probably enough to handle the last survivor of the enemy
forces, especially when Parvati and Anthony and Ernie were already
holding their wands on General Potter, whom she'd ordered taken
alive (well, conscious).</p>
<p>It was Bad, she knew, but she'd really really <em>really</em>
wanted to gloat.</p>
<p>"There's a trick, isn't there?" said Harry, the strain showing
in his voice. "There <em>has</em> to be some trick. You can't just
turn into a perfect general. Not on top of everything else. You're
not that Slytherin! You don't write creepy poetry! <em>No one's
that good at everything!</em> "</p>
<p>General Granger glanced around at her Sunshine Soldiers, and
then looked back at Harry. Everyone was probably watching this on
the screens outside.</p>
<p>And General Granger said, "I can do anything if I study hard
enough."</p>
<p>"Oh now that's just bu-"</p>
<p>"<em>Somnium.</em>"</p>
<p>Harry slumped to the ground in mid-sentence.</p>
<p>"SUNSHINE WINS," intoned the huge voice of Professor Quirrell,
seeming to come from everywhere and nowhere.</p>
<p>"Niceness has triumphed!" cried General Granger.</p>
<p>"<em>Hooray!</em> " shouted the Sunshine Soldiers. Even the
Gryffindor boys said it, and they said it with pride.</p>
<p>"And what's the moral of today's battle?" said General
Granger.</p>
<p>"<em>We can do anything if we study hard enough!</em> "</p>
<p>And the survivors of the Sunshine Regiment marched off toward
the victory field, singing their marching song as they went:</p>
<p><em>Don't be frightened, don't be sad,<br>
We'll only hurt you if you're bad,<br>
And send you to a home that's true,<br>
With new friends to watch over you,<br>
Be sure to tell them you were sent<br>
By Granger's Sunshine Regiment!</em></p>

<p>It wasn't every day you got to see Harry Potter beg.</p>
<p>"<em>Pleeaaase,</em>" whined Harry Potter.</p>
<p>Fred and George shook their heads again, smiling.</p>
<p>There was an agonized look on Harry Potter's face. "But I
<em>told</em> you how I did the one with Kevin Entwhistle's cat,
and Hermione and the vanishing soda, and I <em>can't</em> tell you
about the Sorting Hat or the Remembrall or Professor Snape..."</p>
<p>Fred and George shrugged and turned to leave.</p>
<p>"If you ever do figure it out," said the Weasley twins, "be sure
to let us know."</p>
<p>"<em>You're evil! You're both evil!</em> "</p>
<p>Fred and George firmly closed the door to the empty classroom
behind them, and made sure to keep the grin on their faces for a
while, just in case Harry Potter could see through doors.</p>
<p>Then they turned a corner and their faces sagged.</p>
<p>"I don't suppose Harry's guesses -"</p>
<p>"- gave you any ideas?" they said to each other at the same
time, and then their shoulders slumped further.</p>
<p>Their last relevant memory was of Flume refusing to help them,
though they couldn't remember <em>what</em> they'd asked him to
do...</p>
<p>...but they must have looked elsewhere and found
<em>someone</em> to help them do <em>something</em> illegal, or
they wouldn't have agreed to be Obliviated afterward.</p>
<p>How had they <em>possibly</em> been able to get all that done on
just forty Galleons?</p>
<p>At first they'd worried that they'd forged evidence so good that
Harry actually <em>would</em> end up married to Ginny... but they'd
thought of that too, it seemed. The Wizengamot proceedings had been
tampered with <em>again</em> to put them back the way they'd been
originally, the fake betrothal contract had vanished from its
dragon-guarded vault in Gringotts, and so on. It was pretty scary,
actually. Most people now thought the <em>Daily Prophet</em> had
just made the whole thing up for unguessable reasons, and the
<em>Quibbler</em> had helpfully twisted the knife deeper with the
next day's headline, HARRY POTTER SECRETLY BETROTHED TO LUNA
LOVEGOOD.</p>
<p>Whoever they'd hired would tell them after the statute of
limitations expired, they desperately hoped. But meanwhile it was
awful, they'd pulled their greatest prank ever, maybe the greatest
prank in the history of pranking, and they <em>couldn't remember
how.</em> It was crazy, they'd been able to think of a way the
<em>first</em> time, so why couldn't they see it now after
<em>knowing</em> everything they'd done?</p>
<p>Their only consolation was that Harry didn't know they didn't
know.</p>
<p>Not even Mum had questioned them about it, despite the obvious
Weasley connection. Whatever had been done, it was far out of the
reach of any Hogwarts student... except possibly <em>one</em>, who,
if certain rumors were true, might have done it by snapping his
fingers. <em>Harry</em> had been questioned under Veritaserum, he'd
told them... with Dumbledore present and giving the Aurors scary
looks. The Aurors had asked just enough to determine that Harry
hadn't pulled the prank himself or disappeared anyone, and then
gotten the heck out of Hogwarts.</p>
<p>Fred and George had wondered whether to feel insulted about
Harry Potter being questioned by the Aurors for <em>their</em>
prank, but the look on <em>Harry's</em> face, probably for exactly
the same reason, made everything worth it.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Rita Skeeter and the editor of the <em>Daily
Prophet</em> had both vanished and were probably in another country
by now. They <em>would've</em> liked to be able to tell their
family about that part. Dad would have congratulated them, they
thought, after Mum had finished killing them and Ginny had burned
the remains.</p>
<p>But everything was still all right, they'd tell Dad someday, and
meanwhile...</p>
<p>...meanwhile Dumbledore had happened to sneeze while passing
them in the hallway, and a small package had accidentally dropped
out of his pockets, and inside had been two matched wardbreaker's
monocles of <em>incredible</em> quality. The Weasley twins had
tested their new monocles on the "forbidden" third-floor corridor,
making a quick trip to the magic mirror and back, and they hadn't
been able to see <em>all</em> the detection webs clearly, but the
monocles had shown a <em>lot</em> more than they'd seen the first
time.</p>
<p>Of course they would have to be very careful never to get caught
with the monocles in their possession, or they would end up in the
Headmaster's office getting a stern lecture and maybe even threats
of expulsion.</p>
<p>It was good to know that not everyone who got Sorted into
Gryffindor grew up to be Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry was in a white room, windowless, featureless, sitting
before a desk, facing an expressionless man in formal robes of
solid black.</p>
<p>The room was screened against detection, and the man had
performed exactly twenty-seven spells before saying so much as
"Hello, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>It was oddly appropriate that the man in black was about to try
reading Harry's mind.</p>
<p>"Prepare yourself," the man said tonelessly.</p>
<p>A human mind, Harry's Occlumency book had said, was only exposed
to a Legilimens along certain <em>surfaces</em>. If you failed to
defend your surfaces, the Legilimens would go <em>through</em> and
be able to access any part of you which their own mind was able to
comprehend...</p>
<p>...which tended not to be much. Human minds, it seemed, were
hard for humans to understand on any level but the shallowest.
Harry had wondered if knowing lots of cognitive science could make
him an incredibly powerful Legilimens, but repeated experience had
<em>finally</em> driven into him the lesson that he needed to get a
little less excited in his anticipations about this sort of thing.
It wasn't as if any cognitive scientist understood humans well
enough to make one.</p>
<p>To learn the counter, Occlumency, the first step was to imagine
yourself to be a different person, pretending it as thoroughly as
you could, immersing yourself entirely in that alternate persona.
You wouldn't always have to do that, but in the beginning, it was
how you learned where your surfaces were. The Legilimens would try
to read you, and you would feel it happening if you paid close
enough attention, you would sense them trying to enter. And your
job was to make sure that they always touched your imaginary
persona and not the real one.</p>
<p>When you were good enough at that, you could imagine being a
very <em>simple</em> sort of person, pretend to be a rock, and make
a habit of leaving the pretense in place where all your surfaces
were. That was a standard Occlumency barrier. Pretending to be a
rock was hard to learn, but easy to do afterward, and the exposed
surface of a mind was much shallower than its interior, so with
enough practice you could keep it up as a background habit.</p>
<p>Or if you were a <em>perfect Occlumens</em>, you could race
<em>ahead</em> of any probes, answering queries as fast as they
were asked, so that the Legilimens would enter through your
surfaces and see a mind indistinguishable from whoever you were
pretending to be.</p>
<p>Even the best Legilimens could be fooled that way. If a perfect
Occlumens claimed they were dropping their Occlumency barriers,
there was no way to know if they were lying. Worse, you might not
know you were dealing with a perfect Occlumens. They were rare, but
the fact that they existed meant you couldn't trust Legilimency on
<em>anyone.</em></p>
<p>It was a sad commentary on how little human beings understood
each other, how little any wizard comprehended the depths lying
beneath the mind's surface, that you could fool the best human
telepaths by pretending to be someone else.</p>
<p>But then human beings only understood each other in the first
place by pretending. You didn't make predictions about people by
modeling the hundred trillion synapses in their brain as separate
objects. Ask the best social manipulator on Earth to build you an
Artificial Intelligence from scratch, and they'd just give you a
dumb look. You predicted people by telling <em>your</em> brain to
act like theirs. You <em>put yourself in their place</em>. If you
wanted to know what an angry person would do, you activated your
own brain's anger circuitry, and whatever that circuitry output,
that was your prediction. What did the neural circuitry for anger
actually look like inside? Who knew? The best social manipulator on
Earth might not know what neurons <em>were</em>, and neither might
the best Legilimens.</p>
<p>Anything a Legilimens could <em>understand</em>, an Occlumens
could <em>pretend</em> to be. It was the same trick either way -
probably implemented by the same neural circuitry in both cases, a
single set of control circuits for reconfiguring your own brain to
act as a model of someone else's.</p>
<p>And so the race between telepathic offense and telepathic
defense had been a decisive win for defense. Otherwise the entire
magical world, maybe even the whole Earth, would have been a very
different place...</p>
<p>Harry took a deep breath, and concentrated. There was a slight
smile on his face.</p>
<p>For <em>once,</em> just <em>once,</em> Harry hadn't gotten
shortchanged in the mysterious powers department.</p>
<p>After almost a month of work, and more on a whim than any real
hunch, Harry had decided to make himself coldly angry and then try
the book's Occlumency exercises again. At that point he'd mostly
given up hope on that sort of thing, but it had still seemed worth
a quick try -</p>
<p>He'd run through all the book's hardest exercises in two hours,
and the next day he'd gone and told Professor Quirrell he was
ready.</p>
<p>His dark side, it had turned out, was very, <em>very</em> good
at pretending to be other people.</p>
<p>Harry thought of his standard trigger, from the first time he'd
gone over entirely to his dark side...</p>
<p><em>Severus paused, looking quite pleased with himself. "And
that will be... five points? No, let us make it an even ten points
from Ravenclaw for backchat."</em></p>
<p>Harry's smile grew chillier, and he regarded the black-robed man
who thought he was going to read Harry's mind.</p>
<p>And then Harry turned into someone else entirely, someone who
had seemed appropriate to the occasion.</p>
<p>...in a white room, windowless, featureless, sitting before a
desk, facing an expressionless man in formal robes of solid
black.</p>
<p>Kimball Kinnison regarded the black-robed man who thought he was
going to read the mind of a Second-Stage Lensman of the Galactic
Patrol.</p>
<p>To say that Kimball Kinnison was confident of the outcome would
be an understatement. He had been trained by Mentor of Arisia, the
most powerful mind known to this or any other universe, and the
mere wizard sitting across from him would see precisely what the
Gray Lensman wanted him to see...</p>
<p>...the mind of the boy he was currently disguised as, an
innocent child named Harry Potter.</p>
<p>"I'm ready," said Kimball Kinnison in nervous tones that were
exactly appropriate for an eleven-year-old boy.</p>
<p>"<em>Legilimens,</em>" said the black-robed wizard.</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>The black-robed wizard blinked, as if he'd seen something so
shocking that it had been enough to make even <em>his</em> eyelids
move. His voice wasn't quite toneless as he said, "The
Boy-Who-Lived has a <em>mysterious dark side?</em> "</p>
<p>The heat slowly crept up into Harry's cheeks.</p>
<p>"Well," the man said. His face had now settled back into perfect
calm. "Excuse me. Mr. Potter, it is good to know your advantages,
but that is not the same as being wildly overconfident in them. You
may indeed be able to learn Occlumency at eleven years of age. This
astounds me. I had thought Mr. Dumbledore was pretending to be
insane again. Your dissociative talent is so strong that I am
surprised to find no other signs of childhood abuse, and you may
become a perfect Occlumens in time. But there is a considerable
difference between that and expecting to put up a successful
Occlumency barrier on your first attempt. That is merely
ridiculous. Did you feel anything as I read your mind?"</p>
<p>Harry shook his head, now blushing furiously.</p>
<p>"Then pay closer attention next time. The goal is not to create
a perfect image on your first day of lessons. The goal is to learn
where your surfaces are. Prepare yourself."</p>
<p>Harry tried to pretend to be Kimball Kinnison again, tried to
pay more attention, but his thoughts were a little scattered and he
was suddenly aware of all the things he shouldn't be thinking
about...</p>
<p>Oh, this was going to suck.</p>
<p>Harry gritted his teeth. At least the instructor would be
Obliviated afterward.</p>
<p>"<em>Legilimens.</em>"</p>
<p>There was a pause -</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>...in a white room, windowless, featureless, sitting before a
desk, facing an expressionless man in formal robes of solid
black.</p>
<p>It was their fourth day, on a Sunday evening. When you paid this
much, you got your sessions any darned time you wanted, never mind
the concept of weekends.</p>
<p>"Hello, Mr. Potter," the telepath said tonelessly, having cast
the full suite of privacy spells.</p>
<p>"Hello, Mr. Bester," Harry said wearily. "Let's just get the
initial shock out of the way, shall we?"</p>
<p>"You managed to surprise me?" the man said, now sounding
slightly interested. "Well then." He pointed his wand and stared
into Harry's eyes. "<em>Legilimens.</em>"</p>
<p>There was a pause, and then the black-robed wizard jerked as if
someone had touched him with a cattle prod.</p>
<p>"The Dark Lord is <em>alive?</em> " he choked. His eyes were
suddenly wild. "<em>Dumbledore turns himself invisible and sneaks
into girls' dorm rooms?</em> "</p>
<p>Harry sighed and looked down at his watch. In about another
three seconds...</p>
<p>"So," the man said. He hadn't quite recovered his tonelessness.
"You genuinely believe you're going to discover the secret rules of
magic and become all-powerful."</p>
<p>"That's right," Harry said evenly, still looking at his watch.
"I'm <em>that</em> overconfident."</p>
<p>"I wonder. It seems the Sorting Hat thinks you'll be the next
Dark Lord."</p>
<p>"And <em>you</em> know I'm trying pretty hard <em>not</em> to
be, and you saw that we already had a long discussion about whether
you were willing to teach me Occlumency, and in the end you decided
to do it, so can we just get this over with?"</p>
<p>"All right," said the man exactly six seconds later, same as
last time. "Prepare yourself." He paused, and then said, his voice
rather wistful, "Though I <em>do</em> wish I could remember that
trick with the gold and silver."</p>
<p>Harry was finding himself very disturbed by how reproducible
human thoughts were when you reset people back to the same initial
conditions and exposed them to the same stimuli. It was dispelling
illusions that a good reductionist wasn't supposed to have in the
first place.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry was in a rather bad mood as he stomped out of his
Herbology class the next Monday morning.</p>
<p>Hermione was seething alongside him.</p>
<p>The other children were still inside, a bit slow to assemble
their things because they were gibbering excitedly to each other
about Ravenclaw winning the year's second Quidditch match.</p>
<p>It seemed that last night after dinner, a girl had flown around
on a broomstick for thirty minutes and then caught some sort of
giant mosquito. There were other facts about what had happened
during this match, but they were irrelevant.</p>
<p>Harry had missed this exciting sports event due to his
Occlumency lesson, and also having a life.</p>
<p>He had then avoided all conversations in the Ravenclaw dorm,
weren't Quieting Charms and magical trunks wonderful. He had eaten
breakfast at the Gryffindor table.</p>
<p>But Harry couldn't avoid Herbology, and the Ravenclaws had
talked about it before class, and after class, and <em>during
class,</em> until Harry had looked up from the baby furcot whose
diaper he was changing, and announced loudly that some of them were
trying to learn about <em>plants</em> and Snitches didn't grow on
anything so could they all <em>please</em> shut up about Quidditch.
Everyone else present had given him shocked looks, except Hermione,
who'd looked like she wanted to applaud, and Professor Sprout, who
had awarded him a point for Ravenclaw.</p>
<p><em>A</em> point for Ravenclaw.</p>
<p><em>One</em> point.</p>
<p>The seven idiots on their idiot brooms playing their idiot game
had earned <em>one hundred and ninety points</em> for
Ravenclaw.</p>
<p>It seemed that Quidditch scores <em>added directly onto the
House points total.</em></p>
<p>In other words, catching a golden mosquito was worth 150 House
points.</p>
<p>Harry couldn't even <em>imagine</em> what he would have to do to
earn one hundred and fifty House points.</p>
<p>Besides, y'know, rescuing <em>a hundred and fifty
Hufflepuffs,</em> or coming up with <em>fifteen ideas as good as
putting protective shells on time machines,</em> or inventing
<em>one thousand five hundred creative ways to kill people,</em> or
being Hermione Granger for the <em>entire year</em>.</p>
<p>"We should kill them," Harry said to Hermione, who was walking
beside him with an equally offended air.</p>
<p>"Who?" said Hermione. "The Quidditch team?"</p>
<p>"I was thinking of everyone involved in any way with Quidditch
anywhere, but the Ravenclaw team would be a start, yes."</p>
<p>Hermione's lips were pursed disapprovingly. "You <em>do</em>
know that killing people is wrong, Harry?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said.</p>
<p>"Okay, just checking," Hermione said. "Let's get the Seeker
first. I've read some Agatha Christie mysteries, do you know how we
can get her onto a train?"</p>
<p>"Two students plotting murder," said a dry voice. "How
shocking."</p>
<p>From around a nearby corner strolled a man in lightly spotted
robes, his greasy hair falling long and unkempt about his
shoulders. Deadly danger seemed to radiate out from him, filling
the hallway with improperly mixed potions and accidental falls and
people dying in bed of what the Aurors would rule to be natural
causes.</p>
<p>Without thinking about it at all, Harry stepped in front of
Hermione.</p>
<p>There was an intake of breath from behind him, and then a moment
later Hermione brushed past and stepped in front of <em>him.</em>
"Run, Harry!" she said. "Boys shouldn't have to be in danger."</p>
<p>Severus Snape smiled mirthlessly. "Amusing. I request a moment
of your time, Potter, if you can tear yourself away from your
flirtations with Miss Granger."</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a very worried look on Hermione's face. She
turned to Harry and opened her mouth, then paused, looking
distressed.</p>
<p>"Oh, don't worry, Miss Granger," said Severus's silky voice. "I
promise to return your beau unmaimed." His smile vanished. "Now
Potter and I are about to go off and have a private conversation,
just by ourselves. I hope it is clear that you are not invited, but
just in case, consider that an order from a Hogwarts professor. I'm
sure a good little girl like you won't disobey."</p>
<p>And Severus turned and walked back around the corner. "Coming,
Potter?" his voice said.</p>
<p>"Um," Harry said to Hermione. "Can I just sort of go off and
follow him and let <em>you</em> work out what I should say to make
sure you're not all worried and offended?"</p>
<p>"No," Hermione said, her voice trembling.</p>
<p>Severus's laughter echoed from around the corner.</p>
<p>Harry bowed his head. "Sorry," he said lowly, "really," and he
went off after the Potions Master.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"So," Harry said. There were no other sounds now but two pairs
of legs, the long and the short, padding across a random stone
corridor. The Potions Master was striding quickly but not too fast
for Harry to keep up, and insofar as Harry could apply the concept
of directionality to Hogwarts, they were moving away from the
frequented areas. "What's this about?"</p>
<p>"I don't suppose you could explain," Severus said dryly, "why
the two of you were plotting to murder Cho Chang?"</p>
<p>"I don't suppose <em>you</em> could explain," Harry said dryly,
"in your capacity as an official of the Hogwarts school system, why
catching a golden mosquito is deemed an academic accomplishment
worthy of a hundred and fifty House points?"</p>
<p>A smile crossed Severus's lips. "Dear me, and I thought you were
supposed to be perceptive. Are you truly so incapable of
understanding your classmates, Potter, or do you dislike them too
much to try? If Quidditch scores did not count toward the House Cup
then none of them would care about House points at all. It would
merely be an obscure contest for students like you and Miss
Granger."</p>
<p>It was a shockingly good answer.</p>
<p>And that shock brought Harry's mind fully awake.</p>
<p>In retrospect it shouldn't have been surprising that Severus
understood his students, understood them very well indeed.</p>
<p>He had been reading their minds.</p>
<p>And...</p>
<p>...the book said that a successful Legilimens was extremely
rare, rarer than a perfect Occlumens, because almost no one had
enough mental discipline.</p>
<p><em>Mental discipline?</em></p>
<p>Harry had collected stories about a man who routinely lost his
temper in class and blew up at young children.</p>
<p>...but this same man, when Harry had spoken of the Dark Lord
still being alive, had responded instantly and perfectly - reacting
in precisely the way that someone completely ignorant would
react.</p>
<p>The man stalked about Hogwarts with the air of an assassin,
radiating danger...</p>
<p>...which was exactly <em>not</em> what a real assassin should
do. Real assassins should look like meek little accountants until
they killed you.</p>
<p>He was the Head of House for proud and aristocratic Slytherin,
and he wore a robe with spotted stains from bits of potions and
ingredients, which two minutes of magic could have removed.</p>
<p>Harry noticed that he was confused.</p>
<p>And his threat estimate of the <em>Head of House Slytherin</em>
shot up astronomically.</p>
<p>Dumbledore had seemed to think Severus was his, and there'd been
nothing to contradict that; the Potions Master had been "scary but
not abusive", as promised. So, Harry had reasoned earlier, this was
Fellowship business. If Severus had been planning harm, surely he
wouldn't have come to get Harry in front of Hermione, a witness,
when he could have simply waited for some time when Harry was
alone...</p>
<p>Harry quietly bit his lip.</p>
<p>"I once knew a boy who truly adored Quidditch," said Severus
Snape. "He was an utter pillock. Just as you and I would expect, we
two."</p>
<p>"What <em>is</em> this?" Harry said slowly.</p>
<p>"Patience, Potter."</p>
<p>Severus turned his head, and then glided with his assassin's
bearing into a nearby opening in the corridor walls, a smaller and
narrower hallway leading off.</p>
<p>Harry followed him, wondering if it would be smarter to simply
run away.</p>
<p>They turned and made another turn, and came to a dead end, a
simple blank wall. If Hogwarts had actually been built, rather than
conjured or summoned or birthed or whatever, Harry would have had
some sharp words for the architect about paying people to build
hallways that didn't go anywhere.</p>
<p>"<em>Quietus,</em>" said Severus, and a few other things as
well.</p>
<p>Harry leaned back, folded his arms across his chest, and watched
Severus's face.</p>
<p>"Looking me in the eyes, Potter?" said Severus Snape. "Your
Occlumency lessons cannot have progressed far enough for you to
block Legilimency. But then perhaps they have progressed far enough
for you to detect it. Since I cannot know otherwise, I will not
risk trying." The man smiled thinly. "And the same will hold for
Dumbledore, I think. Which is why we are <em>now</em> having this
little talk."</p>
<p>Harry's eyes widened involuntarily.</p>
<p>"To begin with," Severus said, eyes glittering, "I should like
you to promise not to speak of our conversations to
<em>anyone</em>. So far as the school is concerned, we are
discussing your Potions homework. Whether or not they believe that
is unimportant. So far as Dumbledore and McGonagall are concerned,
I am violating Draco Malfoy's confidences in me, and neither of us
think it proper to speak further of the particulars."</p>
<p>Harry's brain tried to calculate the ramifications and
implications of this and ran out of swap space.</p>
<p>"Well?" said the Potions Master.</p>
<p>"All right," Harry said slowly. It was hard to see how having a
conversation and being unable to tell anyone could be more
constraining than <em>not</em> having it, in which case you
<em>also</em> couldn't tell anyone the contents. "I promise."</p>
<p>Severus was watching Harry intently. "You said once in the
Headmaster's office that you would not tolerate bullying or abuse.
And so I wonder, Harry Potter. Just how much do you resemble your
father?"</p>
<p>"Unless we're talking about Michael Verres-Evans," Harry said,
"the answer is that I know very little about James Potter."</p>
<p>Severus nodded, as though to himself. "There is a fifth-year
Slytherin. A boy named Lesath Lestrange. He is being bullied by
Gryffindors. I am... constrained, in my ability to deal with such
situations. <em>You</em> could help him, perhaps. If you wished. I
am not asking you for a favor, and will not owe you one. It is
simply an opportunity to do as you will."</p>
<p>Harry stared at Severus, thinking.</p>
<p>"Wondering if it's a trap?" said Severus, a faint smile crossing
his lips. "It is not. It <em>is</em> a test. Call it curiosity on
my part. But Lesath's troubles are real, as are my own difficulties
in intervening."</p>
<p>That was the trouble with other people knowing you were a good
guy. Even if you knew they knew, you still couldn't ignore the
bait.</p>
<p>And if his father had protected students from bullies too... it
didn't matter if Harry knew why Severus had told him. It still made
him feel warm inside, and proud, and made it impossible to walk
away.</p>
<p>"Fine," Harry said. "Tell me about Lesath. Why is he being
bullied?"</p>
<p>Severus's face lost the faint smile. "You think there are
<em>reasons</em>, Potter?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps not," Harry said quietly. "But the thought had occurred
to me that he might have pushed some unimportant mudblood girl down
the stairs."</p>
<p>"Lesath Lestrange," Severus said, his voice now cold, "is the
son of Bellatrix Black, the most fanatic and evil servant of the
Dark Lord. Lesath is the acknowledged bastard of Rabastan
Lestrange. Shortly after the Dark Lord's death, Bellatrix and
Rabastan and Rabastan's brother Rodolphus were captured while
torturing Alice and Frank Longbottom. All three are in Azkaban for
life. The Longbottoms were driven insane by repeated Cruciatus and
remain in St. Mungo's incurable ward. Is any of that a good reason
to bully him, Potter?"</p>
<p>"It is no reason at all," Harry said, still quietly. "And Lesath
himself has done no wrong that you know?"</p>
<p>The faint smile crossed Severus's lips again. "He is no more a
saint than anyone else. But he has pushed no mudblood girls down
the stairs, not that I ever heard."</p>
<p>"Or saw in his mind," said Harry.</p>
<p>Severus's expression was chill. "I did not invade his privacy,
Potter. I looked within the Gryffindors, rather. He is simply a
convenient target for their little satisfactions."</p>
<p>A cold wash of anger ran down Harry's spine, and he had to
remind himself that Severus might not be a trustworthy source of
information.</p>
<p>"And you think," Harry said, "that an intervention by Harry
Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, might prove effective."</p>
<p>"Indeed," said Severus Snape, and told Harry when and where the
Gryffindors were planning their next little game.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>There is a main hallway running through the middle of Hogwarts's
second floor on the north-south axis, and near the center of this
hallway there is an opening into a short corridor which goes a
dozen paces back before turning at a right angle, making an
L-shape, and then goes a dozen paces more before it ends at a
bright, wide window, looking out from three stories above upon the
light drizzle falling over the east grounds of Hogwarts. Standing
by the window you can hear nothing of the main hallway, and no one
in the hallway would hear what went on by the window. If you think
there is anything odd about this, you haven't been in Hogwarts very
long.</p>
<p>Four boys in red-trimmed robes are laughing, and a boy in
green-trimmed robes is screaming and grabbing frantically onto the
edges of the opened window with his hands, as the four boys make as
though to push him out. It's just a joke, of course, and besides, a
fall from that height wouldn't kill a wizard. All good fun. If you
think there is anything odd about this -</p>
<p>"<em>What are you doing?</em> " says a sixth boy's voice.</p>
<p>The four boys in red-trimmed robes spin around with sudden
starts, and the boy in green-trimmed robes frantically pushes
himself away from the window and falls to the floor, face streaked
with tears.</p>
<p>"Oh," says the most handsome of the boys in red-trimmed robes,
sounding relieved, "it's <em>you.</em> Hey, Lessy, you know who
this is?"</p>
<p>There isn't any answer from the boy on the floor, who's trying
to get his sniffling under control, and the boy in the red-trimmed
robes draws back his leg for a kick -</p>
<p>"<em>Stop it!</em> " shouts the sixth boy.</p>
<p>The boy in the red-trimmed robes wobbles as he aborts the kick.
"Um," he says, "do <em>you</em> know who this is?"</p>
<p>The sixth boy's breathing sounds strange. "Lesath Lestrange," he
says, his breath coming in short pants, "and <em>he</em> didn't do
anything to my parents, he was five years old."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Neville Longbottom stared at the four huge fifth-year bullies in
front of him, trying very hard to control his trembling.</p>
<p>He should have just told Harry Potter no.</p>
<p>"Why are <em>you</em> defending him?" said the handsome one,
slowly, sounding puzzled with the first hints of offense. "He's a
<em>Slytherin.</em> And a <em>Lestrange.</em>"</p>
<p>"He's a boy who lost his parents," said Neville Longbottom. "I
know how that is." He didn't know where the words had come from. It
sounded too cool, like something Harry Potter would say.</p>
<p>The trembling went on, though.</p>
<p>"<em>Who</em> do you think you <em>are?</em> " said the handsome
one, starting to sound angry.</p>
<p><em>I am Neville, the last scion of the Noble and Most Ancient
House of Longbottom -</em></p>
<p>Neville couldn't say it.</p>
<p>"I think he's a <em>traitor</em>," said one of the other
Gryffindors, and there was a sudden sinking sensation in Neville's
stomach.</p>
<p>He'd known it, he'd just known it. Harry Potter had been wrong
after all. Bullies wouldn't stop only because Neville Longbottom
told them to stop.</p>
<p>The handsome one took a step forward, and the three others
followed.</p>
<p>"So that's how it is for you," Neville said, amazed at how
steady his voice was. "It doesn't matter to you if it's Lesath
Lestrange or Neville Longbottom."</p>
<p>Lesath Lestrange let out a sudden gasp, from where he was lying
on the floor.</p>
<p>"Evil is evil," snarled the same boy who'd spoken before, "and
if you're friends with evil, you're evil too."</p>
<p>The four took another step forward.</p>
<p>Lesath rose, wobbling, to his feet. His face was gray, and he
took a few steps forward, and leaned against the wall, and didn't
say anything. His eyes were fixed on the turn in the hallway, the
way out.</p>
<p>"Friends," Neville said. Now his voice was going up a bit in
pitch. "Yes, I have friends. One of them is the Boy-Who-Lived."</p>
<p>A couple of the Gryffindors looked suddenly worried. The
handsome one didn't flinch. "Harry Potter isn't here," he said, his
voice hard, "and if he was, I don't think he'd like to see a
Longbottom defending a Lestrange."</p>
<p>And the Gryffindors took another long step forward, and behind
them, Lesath crept along the wall, waiting for his chance.</p>
<p>Neville swallowed, and raised his right hand with his thumb and
forefinger pressed together.</p>
<p>He shut his eyes, because Harry Potter had made him promise not
to peek.</p>
<p>If this didn't work, he was never trusting anyone again.</p>
<p>His voice came out surprisingly clear, considering.</p>
<p>"Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres. Harry James
Potter-Evans-Verres. Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres. By the debt
that you owe me and the power of your true name I summon you, I
open the way for you, I call upon you to manifest yourself before
me."</p>
<p>Neville snapped his fingers.</p>
<p>And then Neville opened his eyes.</p>
<p>Lesath Lestrange was staring at him.</p>
<p>The four Gryffindors were staring at him.</p>
<p>The handsome one started to chuckle, and that set off the other
three.</p>
<p>"Was Harry Potter supposed to step around the corner or
something?" said the handsome one. "Aw. Looks like you've been
stood up."</p>
<p>The handsome one took a menacing step forward toward
Neville.</p>
<p>The other three followed in lockstep.</p>
<p>"Ahem," said Harry Potter from behind them, leaning against the
wall by the window, in the dead end of the hallway, where nobody
could possibly have gotten to without being seen.</p>
<p>If watching people scream always felt this good, Neville could
sort of understand why people became bullies.</p>
<p>Harry Potter stalked forward, placing himself between Lesath
Lestrange and the others. He swept his icy gaze across the boys in
red-trimmed robes, and then his eyes came to rest on the handsome
one, the ringleader. "Mr. Carl Sloper," said Harry Potter. "I
believe I have comprehended this situation fully. If Lesath
Lestrange has ever committed a single evil himself, rather than
being born to the wrong parents, the fact is not known to
<em>you.</em> If I am mistaken in this, Mr. Sloper, I suggest you
inform me at once."</p>
<p>Neville saw the fear and awe on the other boys' faces. He was
feeling it himself. Harry had <em>claimed</em> it would all be a
trick, but how could it be?</p>
<p>"But he's a <em>Lestrange</em>," said the ringleader.</p>
<p>"He's a boy who <em>lost his parents</em>," Harry Potter said,
his voice growing even colder.</p>
<p>This time all three of the other Gryffindors flinched.</p>
<p>"So," said Harry Potter. "You saw that Neville didn't want you
tormenting an innocent boy on behalf of the Longbottoms. This
failed to move you. If I tell you that the Boy-Who-Lived
<em>also</em> thinks you are in the wrong, that what you did today
was a terrible mistake, does that make a difference?"</p>
<p>The ringleader took a step toward Harry.</p>
<p>The others did <em>not</em> follow him.</p>
<p>"Carl," one of them said, swallowing. "Maybe we should go."</p>
<p>"They say you're going to be the next Dark Lord," the ringleader
said, staring at Harry.</p>
<p>A grin crossed Harry Potter's face. "They also say I'm secretly
betrothed to Ginevra Weasley and there's a prophecy about us
conquering France." The smile faded. "Since you're determined to
force the issue, Mr. Carl Sloper, let me make things clear.
<em>Leave Lesath alone.</em> I will know if you don't."</p>
<p>"So Lessy snarked to you," said the ringleader coldly.</p>
<p>"Sure," said Harry Potter dryly, "and he also told me what you
did today after you left Charms class, in a private secluded place
where no one could see you, with a certain Hufflepuff girl wearing
a white ribbon in her hair -"</p>
<p>The ringleader's jaw dropped in shock.</p>
<p>"Eep," said one of the other Gryffindors in a high-pitched
voice, and spun on his heels and ran around the corner. His
footsteps rapidly pattered away and faded.</p>
<p>And then there were six.</p>
<p>"Ah," said Harry Potter, "there goes a slightly intelligent
young man. The rest of you could stand to learn from Bertram
Kirke's example, before you get into, shall we say, trouble."</p>
<p>"Are you threatening to snark on us?" said the handsome
Gryffindor, his voice trying to be angry, and rather wavering. "Bad
things happen to snarkers."</p>
<p>The other two Gryffindors started slowly moving back.</p>
<p>Harry Potter started laughing. "Oh, you did not just say that.
Are you <em>really</em> trying to intimidate me? <em>Me?</em> Now
honestly, do you think you're scarier than Peregrine Derrick,
Severus Snape or for that matter You-Know-Who?"</p>
<p>Even the ringleader flinched at that.</p>
<p>Harry Potter raised his hand, fingers poised, and all three of
the Gryffindors leaped backward, and one of them blurted "Don't -
!"</p>
<p>"See," said Harry Potter, "this is where I snap my fingers and
you become part of a hilariously amusing story that will be told
with much nervous laughter at dinner tonight. But the thing is,
people I trust keep telling me not to do that. Professor McGonagall
told me I was taking the easy way out of everything and Professor
Quirrell says I need to learn how to lose. So you remember that
story where I let myself get beaten up by some older Slytherins? We
could do that. You could bully me for a while and I could let you.
Only you remember that part at the end where I tell my many, many
friends inside this school not to do anything about it? This time
we'll skip that part. So go ahead. Bully me."</p>
<p>Harry Potter stepped forward, his arms opened wide in
invitation.</p>
<p>The three Gryffindors broke and ran, and Neville had to sidestep
quickly to avoid getting run over.</p>
<p>There was silence, as their footsteps faded, and then more
silence after that.</p>
<p>And then there were three.</p>
<p>Harry Potter drew a deep breath, then exhaled. "Whew," he said.
"How are you doing, Neville?"</p>
<p>Neville's voice came out in a high-pitched squeak. "Okay,
<em>that</em> was really cool."</p>
<p>A grin flashed across Harry Potter's face. "<em>You</em> were
pretty cool too, you know."</p>
<p>Neville knew that Harry Potter was just saying that, trying to
make him feel good, and it still started a warm glow inside his
chest.</p>
<p>Harry turned toward Lesath Lestrange -</p>
<p>"Are you okay, Lestrange?" said Neville before Harry could open
his mouth.</p>
<p>Now there was something you didn't expect to find yourself
saying, ever.</p>
<p>Lesath Lestrange turned slowly, and stared at Neville, his face
tight, no longer crying, tears glistening as they dried.</p>
<p>"You think you know how it is?" said Lesath, his voice high and
shaking. "<em>You think you know?</em> My parents are in
<em>Azkaban,</em> I try not to think about it and they always
remind me, they think it's <em>great</em> that Mother is there in
the cold and the dark with the Dementors sucking away her life, I
wish I was like Harry Potter, at least his parents aren't hurting,
my parents are always hurting, every second of every day, I wish I
was like you, at least you can see your parents sometimes, at least
you know they loved you, if Mother ever loved me the Dementors will
have eaten that thought by now -"</p>
<p>Neville's eyes were wide with shock. He hadn't expected
this.</p>
<p>Lesath turned to Harry Potter, whose eyes were full of
horror.</p>
<p>Lesath flung himself on the floor in front of Harry Potter,
touched his forehead to the ground, and whispered, "Help me,
Lord."</p>
<p>There was an awful silence. Neville couldn't think of a single
thing to say, and from the naked shock on Harry's face, he couldn't
think of anything either.</p>
<p>"They say you can do anything, please, please my Lord, get my
parents out of Azkaban, I'll be your loyal servant forever, my life
will be yours and my death as well, only please -"</p>
<p>"Lesath," Harry said, his voice breaking, "Lesath, I can't, I
can't really do things like that, it's all just stupid tricks."</p>
<p>"It's <em>not!</em> " said Lesath, his voice high and desperate.
"I <em>saw</em> it, the stories are true, you <em>can!</em> "</p>
<p>Harry swallowed. "Lesath, I set the whole thing up with Neville,
we planned it all out in advance, ask him!"</p>
<p>They had, though Harry hadn't said <em>how</em> he was going to
do any of it...</p>
<p>When Lesath looked up from the floor his face was ghastly, and
his voice came out in a shriek that hurt Neville's ears. "<em>You
son of a mudblood! You could get her out, you just won't! I got
down on my knees and begged you and you still won't help! I should
have known, you're the Boy-Who-Lived, you think she belongs
there!</em> "</p>
<p>"I <em>can't!</em> " Harry said, his voice as desperate as
Lesath's. "It's not a question of what I want, I don't have the
<em>power!</em> "</p>
<p>Lesath rose to his feet, and spat on the floor in front of
Harry, and then turned and walked away. When he was around the
corner the sound of his feet sped up, and as they faded Neville
thought he heard a single sob.</p>
<p>And then there were two.</p>
<p>Neville looked at Harry.</p>
<p>Harry looked at Neville.</p>
<p>"Wow," Neville said quietly. "He didn't seem very grateful for
being rescued."</p>
<p>"He thought I could help him," Harry said, his voice hoarse. "He
had hope for the first time in years."</p>
<p>Neville swallowed, and said it. "I'm sorry."</p>
<p>"Wha?" said Harry, sounding totally confused.</p>
<p>"I wasn't grateful when you helped me -"</p>
<p>"Every single thing you said before was completely right," said
the Boy-Who-Lived.</p>
<p>"No," Neville said, "it wasn't."</p>
<p>They simultaneously gave brief sad smiles, each condescending to
the other.</p>
<p>"I know this wasn't real," said Neville, "I know I couldn't have
done anything if you hadn't been here, but thanks for letting me
pretend."</p>
<p>"Give me a break," said Harry.</p>
<p>Harry had turned from Neville, and was staring out the window at
the gloomy clouds.</p>
<p>A completely ridiculous thought came to Neville. "Are you
feeling guilty because you can't get Lesath's parents out of
Azkaban?"</p>
<p>"No," said Harry.</p>
<p>A few seconds went by.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Harry.</p>
<p>"You're silly," said Neville.</p>
<p>"I am aware of this," said Harry.</p>
<p>"Do you have to do literally <em>anything</em> anyone asks
you?"</p>
<p>The Boy-Who-Lived turned back and looked at Neville again.
"<em>Do?</em> No. Feel guilty about not doing? Yes."</p>
<p>Neville was having trouble finding words. "Once the Dark Lord
died, Bellatrix Black was literally the most evil person in the
entire world and that was <em>before</em> she went to Azkaban. She
tortured my mother and father into insanity because she wanted to
find out what happened to the Dark Lord -"</p>
<p>"I know," Harry said quietly. "I get that, but -"</p>
<p>"No! You <em>don't!</em> She had a <em>reason</em> for doing
that, and my parents were both Aurors! It's not even <em>close</em>
to the worst thing she's ever done!" Neville's voice was
shaking.</p>
<p>"Even so," said the Boy-Who-Lived, his eyes distant as they
stared off into somewhere else, some other place that Neville
couldn't imagine. "There might be some incredibly clever solution
that makes it possible to save everyone and let them all live
happily ever after, and if only I was smart enough I would have
thought of it by now -"</p>
<p>"You have problems," said Neville. "You think you ought to be
what Lesath Lestrange thinks you are."</p>
<p>"Yeah," said the Boy-Who-Lived, "that pretty much nails it.
Every time someone cries out in prayer and I can't answer, I feel
guilty about not being God."</p>
<p>Neville didn't quite understand that, but... "That doesn't sound
good."</p>
<p>Harry sighed. "I understand that I have a problem, and I know
what I need to do to solve it, all right? I'm working on it."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry watched Neville leave.</p>
<p>Of course Harry hadn't said what the solution was.</p>
<p>The solution, obviously, was to hurry up and become God.</p>
<p>Neville's footsteps moved off, and soon could no longer be
heard.</p>
<p>And then there was one.</p>
<p>"Ahem," said Severus Snape's voice from directly behind him.</p>
<p>Harry let out a small scream and instantly hated himself.</p>
<p>Slowly, Harry turned around.</p>
<p>The tall greasy man in the spotted robes was leaning against the
wall in the same position Harry had occupied.</p>
<p>"A fine invisibility cloak, Potter," drawled the Potions Master.
"Much is explained."</p>
<p>Oh, bloody crap.</p>
<p>"And perhaps I have been in Dumbledore's company too long," said
Severus, "but I cannot help but wonder if that is <em>the</em>
Cloak of Invisibility."</p>
<p>Harry immediately turned into someone who'd never heard of the
Cloak of Invisibility and who was <em>exactly</em> as smart as
Harry thought Severus thought Harry was.</p>
<p>"Oh, possibly," said Harry. "I trust you realize the
implications, if it is?"</p>
<p>Severus's voice was condescending. "You have no idea what I'm
talking about, do you, Potter? A rather clumsy try at fishing."</p>
<p>(Professor Quirrell had remarked over their lunch that Harry
really needed to conceal his state of mind better than putting on a
blank face when someone discussed a dangerous topic, and had
explained about one-level deceptions, two-level deceptions, and so
on. So either Severus <em>was</em> in fact modeling Harry as a
one-level player, which made Severus himself two-level, and Harry's
three-level move had been successful; or Severus was a four-level
player and wanted Harry to <em>think</em> the deception had been
successful. Harry, smiling, had asked Professor Quirrell what level
<em>he</em> played at, and Professor Quirrell, also smiling, had
responded, <em>One level higher than you</em>.)</p>
<p>"So you were watching this whole time," said Harry.
"Disillusionment, I think it's called."</p>
<p>A thin smile. "It would have been foolish of me to take the
slightest risk that you came to harm."</p>
<p>"And you wanted to see the results of your test firsthand," said
Harry. "So. Am I like my father?"</p>
<p>A strange sad expression came over the man, one that looked
foreign to his face. "I should sooner say, Harry Potter, that you
resemble -"</p>
<p>Severus stopped short.</p>
<p>He stared at Harry.</p>
<p>"Lestrange called you a son of a mudblood," Severus said slowly.
"It didn't seem to bother you much."</p>
<p>Harry furrowed his eyebrows. "Not under those circumstances,
no."</p>
<p>"You'd just helped him," Severus said. His eyes were intent on
Harry. "And he threw it back in your face. Surely that isn't
something you'd just forgive?"</p>
<p>"He'd just been through a pretty harrowing experience," Harry
said. "And I don't think being rescued by first-years helped his
pride much, either."</p>
<p>"I suppose it was easy enough to forgive," Severus said, and his
voice was odd, "since Lestrange means nothing to you. Just some
strange Slytherin. If it was a friend, perhaps, you would have felt
far more injured by what he said."</p>
<p>"If he were a friend," Harry said, "all the more reason to
forgive him."</p>
<p>There was a long silence. Harry felt, and he couldn't have said
why or from where, that the air was filling up with a dreadful
tension, like water rising, and rising, and rising.</p>
<p>Then Severus smiled, looking suddenly relaxed once more, and all
the tension vanished.</p>
<p>"You are a very forgiving person," Severus said, still smiling.
"I suppose your stepfather, Michael Verres-Evans, was the one who
taught it to you."</p>
<p>"More like Dad's science fiction and fantasy collection," said
Harry. "Sort of my fifth parent, really. I've lived the lives of
all the characters in all my books, and all their mighty wisdom
thunders in my head. Somewhere in there was someone like Lesath, I
expect, though I couldn't say who. It wasn't hard to put myself in
his shoes. And it was my books that told me what to do about it,
too. The good guys forgive."</p>
<p>Severus gave a light, amused laugh. "I'm afraid I wouldn't know
much about what good people do."</p>
<p>Harry looked at him. That was kind of sad, actually. "I'll lend
you some novels with good people in them, if you like."</p>
<p>"I should like to ask your advice about something," Severus
said, his voice casual. "I know of another fifth-year Slytherin who
was being bullied by Gryffindors. He was wooing a beautiful
Muggleborn girl, who came across him being bullied, and tried to
rescue him. And he called her a mudblood, and that was the end for
them. He apologized, many times, but she never forgave him. Have
you any thoughts for what he could have said or done, to win from
her the forgiveness you gave Lestrange?"</p>
<p>"Erm," Harry said, "based on only that information, I'm not sure
<em>he</em> was the main one who had a problem. I'd have told him
not to date someone that incapable of forgiveness. Suppose they'd
gotten married, can you imagine life in that household?"</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>"Oh, but she <em>could</em> forgive," Severus said with
amusement in his voice. "Why, afterward, she went off and became
the girlfriend of the bully. Tell me, why would she forgive the
bully, and not the bullied?"</p>
<p>Harry shrugged. "At a wild guess, because the bully had hurt
someone <em>else</em> very badly, and the bullied had hurt
<em>her</em> just a little, and to her that just felt far more
unforgivable somehow. Or, not to put too fine a point on it, was
the bully handsome? Or for that matter, rich?"</p>
<p>There was another pause.</p>
<p>"Yes to both," said Severus.</p>
<p>"And there you have it," said Harry. "Not that I've ever been
through high school myself, but my books give me to understand that
there's a certain kind of teenage girl who'll be outraged by a
single insult if the boy is plain or poor, yet who can somehow find
room in her heart to forgive a rich and handsome boy his bullying.
She was shallow, in other words. Tell whoever it was that she
wasn't worthy of him and he needs to get over it and move on and
next time date girls who are deep instead of pretty."</p>
<p>Severus stared at Harry in silence, his eyes glittering. The
smile had faded, and though Severus's face twitched, it did not
return.</p>
<p>Harry was starting to feel a bit nervous. "Um, not that I've got
any experience in the area myself, obviously, but I think that's
what a wise adviser from my books would say."</p>
<p>There was more silence and more glittering.</p>
<p>It was probably a good time to change the subject.</p>
<p>"So," Harry said. "Did I pass your test, whatever it was?"</p>
<p>"I think," Severus said, "that there should be no more
conversations between us, Potter, and you would be exceedingly wise
never to speak of this one."</p>
<p>Harry blinked. "Would you mind telling me what I did wrong?"</p>
<p>"You offended me," said Severus. "And I no longer trust your
cunning."</p>
<p>Harry stared at Severus, taken rather aback.</p>
<p>"But you have given me well-meant advice," said Severus Snape,
"and so I will give you true advice in return." His voice was
almost perfectly steady. Like a string stretched almost perfectly
horizontal, despite the massive weight hanging from its middle, by
a million tons of tension pulling at either end. "You almost died
today, Potter. In the future, never share your wisdom with anyone
unless you know exactly what you are both talking about."</p>
<p>Harry's mind finally made the connection.</p>
<p>"<em>You</em> were that -"</p>
<p>Harry's mouth snapped shut as the <em>almost died</em> part sank
in, two seconds too late.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Severus, "I was."</p>
<p>And the terrible tension flooded back into the room like water
pressurized at the bottom of the ocean.</p>
<p>Harry couldn't breathe.</p>
<p><em>Lose. Now.</em></p>
<p>"I didn't know," Harry whispered. "I'm s-"</p>
<p>"No," said Severus. Just that one word.</p>
<p>Harry stood there in silence, his mind frantically searching for
options. Severus stood between him and the window, which was a real
pity, because a fall from that height wouldn't kill a wizard.</p>
<p>"Your books betrayed you, Potter," said Severus, still in that
voice stretched tight by a million tons of pull. "They did not tell
you the one thing you needed to know. You cannot learn from stories
what it is like to lose the one you love. That is something you
could never understand without feeling it yourself."</p>
<p>"My father," Harry whispered. It was his best guess, the one
thing that might save him. "My father tried to protect you from the
bullies."</p>
<p>A ghastly smile stretched across Severus's face, and the man
moved toward Harry.</p>
<p>And past him.</p>
<p>"Goodbye, Potter," said Severus, not looking back on his way
out. "We shall have little to say to each other from today on."</p>
<p>And at the corner, the man stopped, and without turning, spoke
one final time.</p>
<p>"Your father was the bully," said Severus Snape, "and what your
mother saw in him was something I never did understand until this
day."</p>
<p>He left.</p>
<p>Harry turned and walked toward the window. His shaking hands
went onto the ledge.</p>
<p><em>Never give anyone wise advice unless you know exactly what
you're both talking about. Got it.</em></p>
<p>Harry stared out at the clouds and the light drizzle for a
while. The window looked out on the east grounds, and it was
afternoon, so if the sun was visible through the clouds at all,
Harry couldn't see it.</p>
<p>His hands had stopped shaking, but there was a tight feeling in
Harry's chest, like it was being compressed by metal bands.</p>
<p>So his father had been a bully.</p>
<p>And his mother had been shallow.</p>
<p>Maybe they'd grown up later. Good people like Professor
McGonagall did seem to think the world of them, and it might not be
<em>only</em> because they were heroic martyrs.</p>
<p>Of course, that was scant consolation when you were eleven and
about to turn into a teenager, and wondering what sort of teenager
you might become.</p>
<p>So very terrible.</p>
<p>So very sad.</p>
<p>Such an awful life Harry led.</p>
<p>Learning that his genetic parents hadn't been perfect, why, he
ought to spend awhile moping about that, feeling sorry for
himself.</p>
<p>Maybe he could complain to Lesath Lestrange.</p>
<p>Harry had read about Dementors. Cold and darkness surrounded
them, and fear, they sucked away all your happy thoughts and in
that absence all your worst memories rose to the surface.</p>
<p>He could imagine himself in Lesath's shoes, knowing that his
parents were in Azkaban for life, that place from which no one had
ever escaped.</p>
<p>And Lesath would be imagining himself in his mother's place, in
the cold and the darkness and the fear, alone with all of her worst
memories, even in her dreams, every second of every day.</p>
<p>For an instant Harry imagined his own Mum and Dad in Azkaban
with the Dementors sucking out their life, draining away the happy
memories of their love for him. Just for an instant, before his
imagination blew a fuse and called an emergency shutdown and told
him never to imagine that again.</p>
<p>Was it right to do that to anyone, even the second most evil
person in the world?</p>
<p><em>No,</em> said the wisdom of Harry's books, <em>not if
there's any other way, any other way at all.</em></p>
<p>And unless the wizarding justice system was as perfect as their
prisons - and that sounded rather improbable, all things considered
- somewhere in Azkaban was a person who was entirely innocent, and
probably more than one.</p>
<p>There was a burning sensation in Harry's throat, and moisture
gathering in his eyes, and he wanted to teleport all of Azkaban's
prisoners to safety and call down fire from the sky and blast that
terrible place down to bedrock. But he couldn't, because he wasn't
God.</p>
<p>And Harry remembered what Professor Quirrell had said beneath
the starlight: <em>Sometimes, when this flawed world seems
unusually hateful, I wonder whether there might be some other
place, far away, where I should have been... But the stars are so
very, very far away... And I wonder what I would dream about, if I
slept for a long, long time.</em><em><br></em></p>
<p>Right now this flawed world seemed unusually hateful.</p>
<p>And Harry couldn't understand Professor Quirrell's words, it
might have been an alien that had spoken, or an Artificial
Intelligence, something built along such different lines from Harry
that his brain couldn't be forced to operate in that mode.</p>
<p>You couldn't leave your home planet while it still contained a
place like Azkaban.</p>
<p>You had to stay and fight.</p>

<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 32: Interlude: Personal Financial
Management<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>"But Headmaster," Harry argued, some of his desperation leaking
into his voice, "leaving all of my assets in one undiversified
vault full of gold coins - it's crazy, Headmaster! It's like, I
don't know, doing Transfiguration experiments without consulting a
recognized authority! You just don't do that with money!"</p>
<p>From the lined face of the old wizard - underneath a festive
holiday hat like a catastrophic automobile collision between cars
of green and red cloth - a grave, sad look peered out at Harry.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Harry," said Dumbledore, "and I do apologize, but
allowing you control over your own finances would give you far too
much independence of action."</p>
<p>Harry's mouth opened and no sound came out. He was, literally,
speechless.</p>
<p>"I will permit you to withdraw five Galleons for Christmas
presents," said Dumbledore, "which is more than any boy your age
should spend, but poses no threat, I think -"</p>
<p>"<em>I can't believe you just said that!</em> " the words burst
out of Harry's mouth. "You <em>admit</em> to being that
manipulative?"</p>
<p>"Manipulative?" said the old wizard, smiling slightly. "No,
manipulative would be if I did <em>not</em> admit it, or if I had
some deeper motive behind the obvious. This is quite
straightforward, Harry. You are not yet ready to play the game, and
it would be foolish to allow you thousands of Galleons with which
to upset the gameboard."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The bright hustle and bustle of Diagon Alley had increased by a
hundredfold and redoubled as Christmas approached, with all the
shops enshrouded in brilliant sorceries that flashed and sparkled
as though the season's spirit was about to blaze out of control and
turn the whole area into a cheerful holiday crater. The streets
were so crowded with witches and wizards in festive and
<em>loud</em> clothing that your eyes were assaulted almost as
severely as your ears; and it was clear, from the bewildering
variety of the shoppers, that Diagon Alley was considered an
international attraction. There were witches wrapped in giant
swathes of cloth like toweled mummies, and wizards in formal top
hats and bath-robes, and young children barely past toddling age
who were decorated with lights that blazed almost as bright as the
shops themselves, as their parents took them hand in hand through
that magic wonderland and let them shriek to their heart's content.
It was the season to be merry.</p>
<p>And in the midst of all that light and cheer, a note of blackest
night; a cold, dark atmosphere that cleared a few precious paces of
distance even in the midst of all that crush.</p>
<p>"No," said Professor Quirrell, with a look of grim revulsion,
like he'd just bitten into food that not only tasted horrible but
was morally repugnant to boot. It was the sort of grim face an
ordinary person might make after biting into a meat pie, and
discovering that it was rotten and had been made from kittens.</p>
<p>"Oh, come <em>on</em>," Harry said. "You must have <em>some</em>
ideas."</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter," Professor Quirrell said, his lips set in a thin
line, "I agreed to act as your adult guardian on this expedition. I
did not agree to advise you on your choice of presents. I don't do
Christmas, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>"How about Newtonmas?" Harry said brightly. "Isaac Newton
actually <em>was</em> born on December 25th, unlike some other
historical figures I could name."</p>
<p>This failed to impress Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>"Look," said Harry, "I'm sorry, but I've got to do
<em>something</em> special for Fred and George and I've got no idea
of my options."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell made a thoughtful humming sound. "You could
ask which family members they most dislike, and then hire an
assassin. I know someone from a certain government-in-exile who is
quite competent, and he would give you a discount on multiple
Weasleys."</p>
<p>"<em>This</em> Christmas," Harry said, dropping his voice into a
lower register, "give your friends the gift... of
<em>death</em>."</p>
<p>That made Professor Quirrell smile. It went all the way to his
eyes.</p>
<p>"Well," said Harry, "at least you didn't suggest getting them a
pet rat -" Harry's mouth snapped shut, and he was regretting the
words almost as soon as they were out of his mouth.</p>
<p>"Pardon me?" said Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>"Nothing," Harry said at once, "long dumb story." And telling it
seemed wrong somehow, maybe because Harry was afraid Professor
Quirrell would have laughed even if Bill Weasley <em>hadn't</em>
been cured and everything put back to right...</p>
<p>And where had Professor Quirrell <em>been</em> that he'd never
heard the story? Harry had gotten the impression that everyone in
magical Britain knew.</p>
<p>"Look," said Harry, "I'm trying to <em>solidify their loyalty to
me,</em> you know? Make the Weasley twins my minions? Like the old
saying goes: A friend isn't someone you use once and then throw
away, a friend is someone you use over and over again. Fred and
George are two of the most useful friends I have in Hogwarts,
Professor Quirrell, and I plan to use them over and over again. So
if you'd help me be Slytherin here, and suggest something they
might be <em>very</em> grateful for..." Harry's voice trailed off
invitingly.</p>
<p>You just had to pitch these things the right way.</p>
<p>They walked on for a good way before Professor Quirrell spoke
again, his voice practically dripping with distaste. "The Weasley
twins are using secondhand wands, Mr. Potter. They would be
reminded of your generosity with every Charm they cast."</p>
<p>Harry clapped his hands together in involuntary excitement. Just
put the money on account at Ollivander's, and tell Mr. Ollivander
to never refund it - no, better yet, to send it to Lucius Malfoy if
the Weasley twins didn't show up before the start of their next
school year. "That's <em>brilliant</em>, Professor!"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell did not look like he appreciated the
compliment. "I suppose I can tolerate Christmas in <em>that</em>
spirit, Mr. Potter, though only barely." Then he smiled slightly.
"Of course that will cost you fourteen Galleons, and you only have
five."</p>
<p>"<em>Five</em> Galleons," Harry said, with a sniff of outrage.
"Just who does the Headmaster think he's dealing with, anyway?"</p>
<p>"I think," said Professor Quirrell, "that it simply did not
occur to him to fear the consequences if you turned your ingenuity
to the task of obtaining funds. Though you were wise to lose,
rather than making it an explicit threat. Out of curiosity, Mr.
Potter, what <em>would</em> you have done if I hadn't turned away
in boredom while you, in a fit of childish pique, counted out five
Galleons worth of Knuts?"</p>
<p>"Well, the easiest way would've been to borrow money from Draco
Malfoy," said Harry.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell chuckled briefly. "Seriously, Mr.
Potter."</p>
<p><em>Duly noted.</em> "Probably I'd have done a few celebrity
appearances. I wouldn't resort to anything economically disruptive
just for spending money." Harry had checked, and he <em>would</em>
be allowed to keep the Time-Turner while he went home for the
holidays, so that his sleep cycle didn't start to rotate. But then
it was <em>also</em> possible that someone kept an eye out for
magical day traders. The gold and silver trick would've taken work
on the Muggle end, and seed funding, and the goblins might've
gotten suspicious after the first cycle. And starting a real bank
would be a <em>lot</em> of work... Harry hadn't <em>quite</em>
worked out any money-making methods that were fast <em>and</em>
certain <em>and</em> safe, so he'd been very glad when Professor
Quirrell had turned out to be so easily fooled.</p>
<p>"I do hope those five Galleons will be enough to last, since you
counted them so carefully," said Professor Quirrell. "I doubt the
Headmaster shall be so eager to entrust me with your vault key a
second time, once he discovers I've been tricked."</p>
<p>"I'm sure you did your best," Harry said with deep
gratitude.</p>
<p>"Do you need any assistance finding a safe place to store all
those Knuts, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>"Well, sort of," said Harry. "Do you know of any good investment
opportunities, Professor Quirrell?"</p>
<p>And the two of them walked on, in their tiny sphere of silence
and isolation, through the brilliant and bustling crowds; and if
you looked carefully, you would see that where they went, leafy
boughs faded, and flowers withered, and children's toys that played
cheerful bells changed to lower and more ominous notes.</p>
<p>Harry <em>did</em> notice, but he didn't say anything, just
smiled a little to himself.</p>
<p>Everyone had their own way of celebrating the holidays, and the
Grinch was as much a part of Christmas as Santa.</p>

<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The terrifying part was how fast the whole thing had spiraled
out of control.</p>
<p>"Albus," Minerva said, not even trying to keep the worry out of
her voice as the two of them entered the Great Hall, "something has
to be done."</p>
<p>The atmosphere at Hogwarts before Yuletide was usually bright
and cheerful. The Great Hall had already been decorated in green
and red, after a Slytherin and a Gryffindor whose Yule wedding had
become a symbol of friendship transcending Houses and allegiances,
a tradition almost as ancient as Hogwarts itself and which had even
spread to Muggle countries.</p>
<p>Now the students eating dinner were glancing nervously over
their shoulders, or sending vicious glares at other tables, or at
some tables arguing heatedly. You could have described the
atmosphere as <em>tense,</em> perhaps, but the phrase coming to
Minerva's mind was <em>fifth degree of caution.</em></p>
<p>Take a school, into four Houses divided...</p>
<p>Now into each year, add three armies at war.</p>
<p>And the partisanship of Dragon and Sunshine and Chaos had spread
beyond the first-years; they had become the armies for those who
had no armies. Students were wearing armbands with insignia of fire
or smile or upraised hand, and hexing each other in the corridors.
All three first-year generals had told them to stop - even Draco
Malfoy had heard her out and then nodded grimly - but their
supposed followers hadn't listened.</p>
<p>Dumbledore gazed out at the tables with a distant look. "<em>In
every city,</em>" the old wizard quoted softly,"<em>the population
has been divided for a long time past into the Blue and the Green
factions...</em> <em>And they fight against their opponents knowing
not for what end they imperil themselves...</em> <em>So there grows
up in them against their fellow men a hostility which has no cause,
and at no time does it cease or disappear, for it gives place
neither to the ties of marriage nor of relationship nor of
friendship, and the case is the same even though those who differ
with respect to these colours be brothers or any other kin. I, for
my part, am unable to call this anything except a disease of the
soul...</em>"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," said Minerva, "I don't -"</p>
<p>"Procopius," said Dumbledore. "They took their chariot-racing
very seriously, in the Roman Empire. Yes, Minerva, I agree that
something must be done."</p>
<p>"Soon," Minerva said, her voice lowering even further. "Albus, I
think it must be done before Saturday."</p>
<p>On Sunday, most students would leave Hogwarts to stay the
holiday with their families; Saturday, then, was the final battle
of the three first-year armies that would determine the awarding of
Professor Quirrell's thrice-cursed Christmas wish.</p>
<p>Dumbledore glanced over at her, studying her gravely. "You fear
that the explosion will come then, and someone will be hurt."</p>
<p>Minerva nodded.</p>
<p>"And that Professor Quirrell will be blamed."</p>
<p>Minerva nodded again, her face tight. She had long since become
wise in the ways that Defense Professors were fired. "Albus,"
Minerva said, "we cannot lose Professor Quirrell now, we
<em>cannot!</em> If he but stays through January our fifth-years
will pass their OWLs, if he stays through March our seventh-years
will pass their NEWTs, he is remedying years of neglect in months,
a whole generation will grow up able to defend themselves in spite
of the Dark Lord's curse - you must stop the battle, Albus! Ban the
armies now!"</p>
<p>"I am not sure the Defense Professor would take that kindly,"
said Dumbledore, glancing over toward the Head Table where Quirrell
was drooling into his soup. "He did seem most attached to his
armies, though when I agreed I thought there would be four in each
year." The old wizard sighed. "A clever man, probably with the best
of intentions; but perhaps not clever enough, I fear. And to ban
the armies might also trigger the explosion."</p>
<p>"But then Albus, what will you <em>do?</em> "</p>
<p>The old wizard favored her with a benign smile. "Why, I shall
plot, of course. It's the new fashion in Hogwarts."</p>
<p>And they had come too close to the Head Table for Minerva to say
anything more.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The terrifying part was how fast the whole thing had spiraled
out of control.</p>
<p>The first battle in December had been... messy, or so Draco had
heard.</p>
<p>The second battle had been <em>deranged</em>.</p>
<p>And the next one would be <em>worse</em>, unless the three of
them together succeeded in their last desperate attempt to stop
it.</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell, this is insanity," Draco said flatly. "This
isn't Slytherin any more, it's just..<em>.</em>" Draco was at a
loss for words. He waved his hands helplessly. "You can't possibly
do any real plots with all this stuff going on. Last battle, one of
my soldiers faked his own suicide. We have <em>Hufflepuffs</em>
trying to plot, and they think they can, but they <em>can't.</em>
Things just happen at random now, it doesn't have anything to do
with who's cleverest, or which army fights best, it's..." He
couldn't even describe it.</p>
<p>"I agree with Mr. Malfoy," said Granger in the tones of someone
who hadn't ever expected to hear herself saying those words.
"Allowing traitors isn't working, Professor Quirrell."</p>
<p>Draco had tried forbidding anyone in his army to plot except
him, and that had just driven the plots underground, no one wanted
to be left out when the soldiers in <em>other</em> armies got to
plot. After miserably losing their last battle, he'd finally given
in and revoked his decree; but by then his soldiers had already
started setting their own personal plans in motion, without any
sort of central coordination.</p>
<p>After being told all the plans, or what his soldiers claimed
were their plans, Draco had tried to sketch a plot to win the final
battle. It had required considerably more than three different
things to go right, and Draco had used <em>Incendio</em> on the
paper and <em>Everto</em> to vanish the ashes, because if Father
had seen it he would have been disowned.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's eyelids were half-closed, his chin resting
on his hands as he leaned forward onto his desk. "And you, Mr.
Potter?" said the Defense Professor. "Are you likewise in
agreement?"</p>
<p>"All we'd need to do is shoot Franz Ferdinand and we could start
World War One," said Harry. "It's gone to complete chaos. I'm all
for it."</p>
<p>"<em>Harry!</em> " said Draco in utter shock.</p>
<p>He didn't even realize until a second later that he'd said it at
exactly the same time, and in exactly the same tone of indignation,
as Granger.</p>
<p>Granger shot him a startled glance, and Draco carefully kept his
face neutral. Oops.</p>
<p>"That's right!" said Harry. "I'm betraying you! Both of you!
Again! Ha ha!"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was smiling thinly, though his eyes were
still half-closed. "And why is that, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>"Because I think I can cope with the chaos better than Miss
Granger or Mr. Malfoy," said the traitor. "Our war is a zero-sum
game, and it doesn't matter whether it's easy or hard in an
absolute sense, only who does better or worse."</p>
<p>Harry Potter was learning far too fast.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's eyes moved beneath their lids to regard
Draco, and then Granger. "In truth, Mr. Malfoy, Miss Granger, I
simply could not live with myself if I shut down the grand debacle
before its climax. One of your soldiers has even become a quadruple
agent."</p>
<p>"<em>Quadruple?</em> " said Granger. "But there's only three
sides in the war!"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Professor Quirrell, "you'd think that, wouldn't you.
I am not sure that there has ever in history been a quadruple
agent, or any army with such a high fraction of real and pretended
traitors. We are exploring new realms, Miss Granger, and we cannot
turn back now."</p>
<p>Draco left the Defense Professor's office with his teeth
gritting hard against each other, and Granger looking even more
annoyed beside him.</p>
<p>"I can't believe you did that, Harry!" said Granger.</p>
<p>"Sorry," Harry said, not sounding sorry at all, his lips curved
up in a merry smile of evil. "Remember, Hermione, it <em>is</em>
just a game, and why should generals like us be the only ones who
get to plot? And besides, what are the two of you going to do about
it? Team up against me?"</p>
<p>Draco traded glances with Granger, knowing that his own face was
as tight as hers. Harry had been relying, more and more openly and
gloatingly, on Draco's refusal to make common cause with a mudblood
girl; and Draco was beginning to get <em>sick</em> of having that
used against him. If this kept up much longer he <em>was</em> going
to ally with Granger just to crush Harry Potter, and see how much
the son of a mudblood liked <em>that.</em></p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The terrifying part was how fast the whole thing had spiraled
out of control.</p>
<p>Hermione stared at the parchment Zabini had given her, feeling
utterly and completely helpless.</p>
<p>There were names, and lines connecting the names to other names,
and some of the lines were in different colors and...</p>
<p>"Tell me," said General Granger, "is there anyone in my army who
<em>isn't</em> a spy?"</p>
<p>The two of them weren't in the office but in another, deserted
classroom, and they were alone; because, Colonel Zabini had said,
it was now nearly certain that at least one of the captains was a
traitor. Probably Captain Goldstein, but Zabini didn't know for
sure.</p>
<p>Her question had put an ironic smile on the young Slytherin's
face. Blaise Zabini always seemed a little disdainful of her, but
he didn't seem to actively dislike her; nothing like the derision
he held for Draco Malfoy, or the resentment he had developed for
Harry Potter. She had worried at first about Zabini betraying her,
but the boy seemed desperate to show that the other two generals
were no better than him; and Hermione thought that while Zabini
would probably be happy to sell her out to anyone <em>else</em>,
he'd never let Malfoy or Harry win.</p>
<p>"Most of your soldiers <em>are</em> still loyal to you, I'm
pretty sure," said Zabini. "It's just that no one wants to be left
out of the fun." The scornful look on the Slytherin's face made it
clear what he thought of people who didn't take plotting seriously.
"So they think they can be double agents and secretly work for our
side while pretending to betray us."</p>
<p>"And that would also go for anyone in the <em>other</em> armies
who says they want to be <em>our</em> spy," Hermione said
carefully.</p>
<p>The young Slytherin shrugged. "I think I did a good job of
telling which ones really want to sell out Malfoy, I'm not sure
<em>anyone</em> really wants to sell out Potter to you. But Nott is
a sure bet for betraying Potter to Malfoy and since I had
Entwhistle approach him supposedly on behalf of Malfoy and
Entwhistle really reports to us, that's almost as good -"</p>
<p>Hermione closed her eyes for a moment. "We're going to lose,
aren't we?"</p>
<p>"Look," Zabini said patiently, "You're in the lead right now on
Quirrell points. We just have to not lose this last battle
<em>completely</em> and you'll have enough Quirrell points to win
the Christmas wish."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell had announced that the final battle would
operate on a formal scoring system, which he'd been asked to do to
avoid recriminations afterward. Each time you shot someone, the
general of your army got two Quirrell points. A gong would ring
through the battle area (they didn't know yet where they would be
fighting, though Hermione was hoping for the forest again, where
Sunshine did well) and its pitch would tell which army had won the
points. And if anyone was faking being hit, the gong would ring out
anyway, and then a double gong would ring later, after no fixed
time, to hail the retraction. And if you called the name of an
army, cried "For Sunshine!" or "For Chaos!" or "For Dragon!", it
switched your allegiance to that army...</p>
<p>Even Hermione had been able to see the flaw in <em>that</em> set
of rules. But Professor Quirrell had gone on to announce that if
you'd been originally assigned to Sunshine, nobody could shoot you
in the name of Sunshine - or rather, they could, but then Sunshine
lost a single Quirrell point, symbolized by a triple gong. That
prevented you from shooting your own soldiers for points, and
discouraged suiciding before the enemy got you, but you could still
shoot spies if you had to.</p>
<p>Right now, Hermione had two hundred and forty-four Quirrell
points, and Malfoy had two hundred and nineteen, and Harry had two
hundred and twenty-one; and there were twenty-four soldiers in each
army.</p>
<p>"So we fight carefully," Hermione said, "and just try not to
lose too badly."</p>
<p>"No," said Zabini. The young Slytherin's face was now serious.
"The problem is, Malfoy and Potter both know that their only way to
win is to combine and crush us, then fight it out on their own. So
here's what I think we should do -"</p>
<p>Hermione left the classroom in something of a daze. Zabini's
plan hadn't been the obvious one, it had been strange and
complicated and layered and the sort of thing she would've expected
Harry to come up with, not Zabini. It felt wrong just for her to be
able to <em>understand</em> a plan like that. Young girls shouldn't
be able to understand plans like that. The Hat would've Sorted her
into Slytherin, if it'd seen that she could understand plans like
that...</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The awesome thing was how fast he'd been able to escalate the
chaos once he started doing it deliberately.</p>
<p>Harry sat in his office; he'd been given the authority to order
furniture from the house elves, so he'd ordered a throne, and
curtains in a black and crimson pattern. Scarlet light like blood,
mixed with shadow, poured over the floor.</p>
<p>Something in Harry felt like he'd finally come home.</p>
<p>Before him stood the four Lieutenants of Chaos, his most trusted
minions, one of whom was a traitor.</p>
<p>This. This was what life should be like.</p>
<p>"We are gathered," said Harry.</p>
<p>"Let Chaos reign," chorused his four Lieutenants.</p>
<p>"My hovercraft is full of eels," said Harry.</p>
<p>"I will not buy this record, it is scratched," chorused his four
Lieutenants.</p>
<p>"All mimsy were the borogroves."</p>
<p>"And the mome raths outgrabe!"</p>
<p>That concluded the formalities.</p>
<p>"How goes the confusion?" Harry said in a dry whisper like
Emperor Palpatine.</p>
<p>"It goes well, General Chaos," said Neville in the tone he
always used for military matters, a tone so deep that the boy often
had to stop and cough. The Chaotic Lieutenant was neatly dressed in
his black school robes, trimmed in the yellow of Hufflepuff House,
and his hair was parted and combed in the usual look for an earnest
young boy. Harry had liked the incongruity better than any of the
cloaks they'd tried. "Our Legionnaires have begun five new plots
since yesterday evening."</p>
<p>Harry smiled evilly. "Do any of them have a chance of
working?"</p>
<p>"I don't think so," said Neville of Chaos. "Here's the
report."</p>
<p>"Excellent," said Harry, and laughed chillingly as he took the
parchment from Neville's hand, trying his best to make it sound
like he was choking on dust. That brought the total to sixty.</p>
<p>Let Draco <em>try</em> to handle that. Let him <em>try</em>.</p>
<p>And as for Blaise Zabini...</p>
<p>Harry laughed again, and this time it didn't even take an effort
to sound evil. He really needed to borrow someone's pet Kneazle for
his staff meetings, so he'd have a cat to stroke while he did
this.</p>
<p>"Can the Legion stop making plots now?" said Finnigan of Chaos.
"I mean, don't we have enough already -"</p>
<p>"No," Harry said flatly. "We can <em>never</em> have enough
plots."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell had put it perfectly. They were pushing the
boundaries further, perhaps, than they had ever been pushed; and
Harry wouldn't have been able to live with himself if he'd turned
back now.</p>
<p>There came a knock at the door.</p>
<p>"That will be the Dragon General," Harry said, smiling with evil
prescience. "He arrives precisely as I expected. Do show him in,
and yourselves out."</p>
<p>And the four Lieutenants of Chaos shuffled out, casting dark
looks at Draco as the enemy general entered into Harry's secret
lair.</p>
<p>If he wasn't allowed to do this when he was older, Harry was
just going to stay eleven forever.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The sun was dripping through the red curtains, sending rays of
blood dancing across the floor from behind Harry Potter's
grownup-sized cushioned chair, which he had covered in gold and
silver glitter and insisted on referring to as his throne.</p>
<p>(Draco was beginning to feel a lot more confident that he'd done
the right thing in deciding to overthrow Harry Potter before he
could take over the world. Draco couldn't even <em>imagine</em>
what it would be like to live under his rule.)</p>
<p>"Good evening, Dragon General," said Harry Potter in a chill
whisper. "You have arrived just as I expected."</p>
<p>This was not surprising, considering that Draco and Harry had
agreed on the meeting time in advance.</p>
<p>And it also wasn't evening, but by now Draco knew better than to
say anything.</p>
<p>"General Potter," Draco said with as much dignity as he could
manage, "you know that our two armies have to work together for
<em>either</em> of us to win Professor Quirrell's wish, right?"</p>
<p>"Yesss," hissed Harry, like the boy thought he was a
Parselmouth. "We must cooperate to destroy Sunshine, and only then
fight it out between us. But if one of us betrays the other earlier
on, that one could gain an advantage in the later fight. And the
Sunshine General, who knows all this, will try to trick each of us
into thinking the other has betrayed them. And you and I, who know
that, will be tempted to betray the other and pretend that it is
Granger's trickery. And Granger knows <em>that</em>, as well."</p>
<p>Draco nodded. That much was obvious. "And... both of us
<em>only</em> want to win, and there's no one else who'll punish
either of us if we defect..."</p>
<p>"Precisely," said Harry Potter, his face now turning serious.
"We are faced with a <em>true</em> Prisoner's Dilemma."</p>
<p>The Prisoner's Dilemma, according to Harry's teachings, ran
thus: Two prisoners had been locked in separate cells. There was
evidence against each prisoner, but only minor evidence, enough for
a prison sentence of two years apiece. Each prisoner could opt to
<em>defect,</em> betray the other, testify against them in court;
and this would take one year off their own prison sentence, but add
two years to the other's. Or a prisoner could <em>cooperate,</em>
staying silent. So if both prisoners defected, each testifying
against the other, they would serve three years apiece; if both
cooperated, or stayed silent, they would serve two years each; but
if one defected and the other cooperated, the defector would serve
a single year, and the cooperator would serve four.</p>
<p>And both prisoners had to make their decision without knowing
the other one's choice, and neither would be given a chance to
change their decision afterward.</p>
<p>Draco had observed that if the two prisoners had been Death
Eaters during the Wizarding War, the Dark Lord would have killed
any traitors.</p>
<p>Harry had nodded and said that was <em>one</em> way to resolve
the Prisoner's Dilemma - and in fact both Death Eaters would
<em>want</em> there to be a Dark Lord for exactly that reason.</p>
<p>(Draco had asked Harry to stop and let him to think about this
for a while before they continued. It had explained a <em>lot</em>
about why Father and his friends had agreed to serve under a Dark
Lord who often wasn't nice to them...)</p>
<p>In fact, Harry had said, this was pretty much the reason why
people had governments - <em>you</em> might be better off if you
stole from someone else, just like each prisoner would be
individually better off if they defected in the Prisoner's Dilemma.
But if <em>everyone</em> thought like that, the country would fall
into chaos and everyone would be worse off, like what would happen
if both prisoners defected. So people let themselves be ruled by
governments, just like the Death Eaters had let themselves be ruled
by the Dark Lord.</p>
<p>(Draco had asked Harry to stop again. Draco had always taken for
granted that ambitious wizards put themselves in power because they
wanted to rule, and people let themselves be ruled because they
were scared little Hufflepuffs. And this, on reflection, still
seemed true; but Harry's perspective was fascinating even if it was
wrong.)</p>
<p>But, Harry had continued afterward, the fear of a third party
punishing you was not the <em>only</em> possible reason to
cooperate in the Prisoner's Dilemma.</p>
<p>Suppose, Harry had said, you were playing the game against a
magically produced identical copy of yourself.</p>
<p>Draco had said that if there were two Dracos, of course neither
Draco would want anything bad to happen to the other one, not to
mention that no Malfoy would let himself become known as a
traitor.</p>
<p>Harry had nodded again, and said that this was yet
<em>another</em> solution to the Prisoner's Dilemma - people might
cooperate because they cared about each other, or because they had
senses of honor, or because they wanted to preserve their
reputation. Indeed, Harry had said, it was rather difficult to
construct a <em>true</em> Prisoner's Dilemma - in real life, people
usually cared about the other person, or their honor or their
reputation or a Dark Lord's punishment or <em>something</em>
besides the prison sentences. But suppose the copy had been of
someone <em>completely</em> selfish -</p>
<p>(Pansy Parkinson had been the example they'd used)</p>
<p>- so each Pansy only cared what happened to <em>her</em> and not
to the other Pansy.</p>
<p><em>Given</em> that this was all Pansy cared about... and that
there was no Dark Lord... and Pansy wasn't worried about her
reputation... and Pansy either had no sense of honor or didn't
consider herself obligated to the other prisoner... <em>then</em>
would the rational thing be for Pansy to cooperate, or defect?</p>
<p>Some people, Harry said, claimed that the rational thing to do
was for Pansy to defect against her copy, but Harry, plus someone
named Douglas Hofstadter, thought these people were wrong. Because,
Harry had said, if Pansy defected - not at random, but for what
seemed to her like <em>rational reasons</em> - then the other Pansy
would think exactly the same way. Two identical copies wouldn't
decide different things. So Pansy had to choose between a world in
which both Pansies cooperated, or a world in which both Pansies
defected, and she was better off if both copies cooperated. And if
Harry had thought 'rational' people <em>did</em> defect in the
Prisoner's Dilemma, then he wouldn't have done anything to spread
that kind of 'rationality', because a country or a conspiracy full
of 'rational' people would dissolve into chaos. You would tell your
<em>enemies</em> about 'rationality'.</p>
<p>Which had all <em>sounded</em> reasonable at the time, but
<em>now</em> the thought was occurring to Draco that...</p>
<p>"<em>You</em> said," Draco said, "that the rational solution to
the Prisoner's Dilemma is to cooperate. But of course <em>you</em>
would want me to believe that, wouldn't you?" And if Draco was
fooled into cooperating, Harry would just say, <em>Ha ha, betrayed
you again!</em> and laugh at him about it afterward.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't fake your lessons," Harry said seriously. "But I
have to remind you, Draco, that I didn't say you should just
automatically cooperate. Not on a <em>true</em> Prisoner's Dilemma
like this one. What I said was that when you choose, you shouldn't
think like you're choosing for just yourself, <em>or</em> like
you're choosing for everyone. You should think like you're choosing
for all the people who are <em>similar enough</em> to you that
they'll probably do the same thing you do for the same reasons. And
also choosing the predictions made by anyone who knows you well
enough to predict you accurately, so that you never have to regret
being rational because of the correct predictions that other people
make about you - remind me to explain about Newcomb's Problem at
some point. So the question you and I have to ask, Draco, is this:
are we similar enough that we'll probably do the <em>same
thing</em> whatever it is, making our decisions in mostly the same
way? Or do we know each other well enough to predict each other, so
that <em>I</em> can predict whether you'll cooperate or defect, and
<em>you</em> can predict that I've decided to do the same thing I
predict you'll do, because <em>I</em> know that you can predict me
deciding that?"</p>
<p>...and Draco could not help but think that since he had to
strain just to understand <em>half</em> of that, the answer was
obviously 'No'.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Draco.</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>"I see," said Harry, sounding disappointed. "Oh, well. I guess
we'll have to think of some other way, then."</p>
<p>Draco hadn't thought that was going to work.</p>
<p>Draco and Harry talked about it back and forth. They had both
agreed much earlier that what they did on the battlefield would
<em>not</em> count as broken promises in real life - though Draco
was a little angry about what Harry had done in Professor
Quirrell's office, and said so.</p>
<p>But if the two of them couldn't rely on honor or friendship,
that <em>did</em> leave the question of how to get their armies to
work together on beating Sunshine, despite everything Granger might
try to break them up. Professor Quirrell's rules didn't make it
tempting to let Sunshine kill the other army's soldiers - that just
increased the bar you had to pass yourself - but it did tempt each
side to steal kills instead of acting like a single army would, or
to shoot some of the other side's soldiers during the confusion of
battle...</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Hermione was walking back to Ravenclaw not really looking where
she was going, her mind preoccupied with war and treachery and
other age-inappropriate concepts, and she turned a corner and
bumped straight into a grownup.</p>
<p>"Sorry," she said automatically, and then, entirely without
thinking, "<em>Eeeeek!</em> "</p>
<p>"Don't worry, Miss Granger," said the cheerful smile, set
beneath the twinkling eyes, and above the silver beard, of the
HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS. "You are quite forgiven."</p>
<p>Her gaze was helplessly locked on the kindly face of the most
powerful wizard in the world, who was also the Chief Warlock, who
was also the Supreme Mugwump, who had gone insane years ago from
the stress of fighting the Dark Lord, and numerous other facts that
were popping up into her mind one after the other while her throat
went on making little embarrassing squeaks.</p>
<p>"In fact, Miss Granger," said Albus Percival Wulfric Brian
Dumbledore, "it is quite lucky that we bumped into each other. Why,
I was just now wondering curiously what the three of you were
thinking of asking for your wishes..."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Saturday dawned bright and clear and with the students speaking
in hushed voices, as though the first to shout might set off the
explosion.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Draco had hoped that they would be fighting in the upper levels
of Hogwarts again. Professor Quirrell had said that real fights
were more likely to take place in cities than forests, and fighting
inside schoolrooms and corridors was supposed to simulate that,
with ribbons to mark the allowed areas. Dragon Army had done well
in those fights.</p>
<p>Instead, just as Draco had feared, Professor Quirrell had come
up with something <em>special</em> for this battle.</p>
<p>The battleground was the Hogwarts Lake.</p>
<p>And not in boats, either.</p>
<p>They were fighting <em>underwater</em>.</p>
<p>The Giant Squid had been temporarily paralyzed; spells had been
set in place to keep away the grindylows; Professor Quirrell had
gone and talked to the merfolk; and all the soldiers had been
issued <em>potions of underwater action</em> that allowed them to
breathe, see clearly, talk to each other, and swim not quite as
fast as a fast walk by kicking their legs.</p>
<p>A huge silver sphere hung in the center of the battleground,
shining like a small underwater moon. It would help to provide a
sense of direction - at first. The moon would slowly go into
eclipse as the battle went on, and when it had gone entirely dark,
the battle would end if it hadn't already.</p>
<p>War in water. You couldn't defend a perimeter, attackers could
come at you from any direction, and even with the potion you
couldn't see very far in the darkness of the lake.</p>
<p>And if you swam too far away from the action, you would start to
glow after a while, and be easy to hunt down - ordinarily if an
army scattered and ran instead of fighting, Professor Quirrell
would just declare them defeated; but today they were working on a
points system. Of course you still had some time <em>before</em>
you started to glow, if you wanted to play assassin.</p>
<p>Dragon Army had been set low in the water at the start of the
game; above and far away, the distant underwater moon shone. The
murky water was mostly lit by <em>Lumos</em> Charms, though his
soldiers would extinguish the lights as soon as they began
maneuvers. There was no point in letting the enemy see you before
you saw them.</p>
<p>Draco kicked his legs a few times, propelling him to a higher
position from which he could gaze down at where his soldiers
hovered in the water.</p>
<p>The conversations died down almost at once under Draco's icy
glare, his soldiers looking up at him with gratifying expressions
of fear and worry.</p>
<p>"Listen to me very carefully," said General Malfoy. His voice
came out a little lower, a little burbly with bubbles, <em>libsten
to me vebwy caerbfully</em>, but the sound traveled clearly.
"There's only one way we can win this. We've got to march on
Sunshine together with Chaos, and beat Sunshine. <em>Then</em> we
fight it out with Potter and win. That's <em>got</em> to happen,
understand? No matter what else goes on, that part <em>has</em> to
happen that way -"</p>
<p>And Draco explained the plan he and Harry had come up with.</p>
<p>Astonished looks were exchanged among the soldiers.</p>
<p>"- and if any of <em>your</em> plots get in the way of that,"
finished Draco, "after we are out of the water, I will set you on
<em>fire</em>."</p>
<p>There was a nervous chorus of yessirs.</p>
<p>"And everyone with secret orders, make sure you carry them out
<em>to the letter,</em>" said Draco.</p>
<p>Around half his soldiers <em>openly nodded,</em> and Draco
marked them for death after he rose to power.</p>
<p>Of course all the private orders were fake, like one Dragon
being told to offer a false traitor's commission to another Dragon,
and the second Dragon being told in hushed confidence to report
anything said by the first Dragon. Draco had told each Dragon that
the whole war could depend on that one thing, and that he hoped
they understood it was more important than the plans they'd
previously made. With luck that would keep all the idiots happy,
and maybe flush out a few spies to boot, if the reports didn't
match the instructions.</p>
<p>Draco's real plan for winning against Chaos... well, it was
simpler than the one he'd burned, but Father still wouldn't have
liked it. Despite trying, though, Draco hadn't been able to think
of anything better. It was a plot that couldn't <em>possibly</em>
have worked against anyone except Harry Potter. In fact it had
<em>been</em> Harry's plan originally, according to the traitor,
though Draco had guessed that without being told. Draco and the
traitor had just modified it a little...</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry took a deep breath, feeling the water gurgle harmlessly in
his lungs.</p>
<p>They'd fought in the forest, and he hadn't gotten a chance to
say it.</p>
<p>They'd fought in the corridors of Hogwarts, and he hadn't gotten
a chance to say it.</p>
<p>They'd fought in the air, broomsticks issued to every soldier,
and it still hadn't made sense to say it.</p>
<p>Harry had thought he wouldn't ever get to say those words, not
while he was still young enough for them to be real...</p>
<p>The Chaos Legionnaires were looking at Harry in puzzlement, as
their general swam with his feet pointing up toward the distant
light of the surface, and his head pointed down toward the murky
depths.</p>
<p>"<em>Why are you upside down?</em> " the young commander shouted
at his army, and began to explain how to fight after you abandoned
the privileged orientation of gravity.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>A hollow, booming bell echoed through the water, and on the
instant, Zabini and Anthony and five other soldiers struck out
downward, into the murky depths of the lake. Parvati Patil, the
only Gryffindor in the group, turned her head back for a moment and
gave them all a cheery wave as she dived; and after a moment, Scott
and Matt did the same. The rest just sank and vanished.</p>
<p>General Granger swallowed a lump in her throat as she watched
them go. She was risking everything on this, dividing her army
instead of just trying to take as many enemy soldiers with them as
possible.</p>
<p>The thing to realize, Zabini had told her, was that no army
would move until they had a plan that let them expect victory.
Sunshine couldn't just plan to win themselves, they had to make
both other armies <em>think</em> they would win until it was too
late.</p>
<p>Ernie and Ron still looked like they were in shock. Susan was
gazing after the disappearing soldiers with a calculating look. Her
army, what was left of it, just looked bewildered, traceries of
light dappling on their uniforms as they all drifted just below the
sunlit surface of the lake.</p>
<p>"<em>Now</em> what?" said Ron.</p>
<p>"Now we wait," said Hermione, loudly enough for all the soldiers
to hear. It felt odd to talk with her mouth full of water, she kept
feeling like she was committing some sort of horrible impoliteness
at the dinner table and was about to drool all over herself. "All
of us left here are going to get zapped, but that was going to
happen anyway with Dragon and Chaos ganging up on us. We've just
got to take as many of them with us as we can."</p>
<p>"I've got a plan," said one of her Sunshine Soldiers... Hannah,
her voice had been a little hard to recognize at first. "It's like
all complicated, but I know how we can get Dragon and Chaos to
start fighting each other -"</p>
<p>"Me too!" said Fay. "I've got a plan too! See, Neville
Longbottom is secretly on our side -"</p>
<p>"<em>You</em> were talking to Neville?" said Ernie. "That's not
right, <em>I</em> was the one who -"</p>
<p>Daphne Greengrass and a couple of other Slytherins who hadn't
gone with Zabini were giggling helplessly as the cries of "No,
wait, <em>I</em> was the one who got Longbottom" erupted from one
soldier after another.</p>
<p>Hermione just looked at them all wearily.</p>
<p>"Okay," said Hermione when it had all died down, "does everyone
get it? All your plots were faked by the Chaos Legion, or maybe
some by Dragon. Anyone who <em>really</em> wanted to betray Harry
or Malfoy went straight to me or Zabini, not you. Just go ahead and
compare notes on all your secret plots and you'll see it for
yourselves." She might not be as good at plotting as Zabini, but
she could always understand what all her officers told her, that
was why Professor Quirrell had made her the general. "So don't
bother trying to do any plots when the other armies get here. Just
fight, okay? Please?"</p>
<p>"But," said Ernie with shock on his face, "Neville is in
<em>Hufflepuff!</em> You're saying he <em>lied</em> to us?"</p>
<p>Daphne was laughing so hard and so helplessly that the
exhalations had turned her upside down in the water.</p>
<p>"I'm not sure <em>what</em> Longbottom is," said Ron darkly,
"but I don't think he's a Hufflepuff any more. Not now that
<em>Harry Potter's</em> got to him."</p>
<p>"Do you know," said Susan, "I <em>asked</em> him that, and
Neville told me he had become a Chaos Hufflepuff?"</p>
<p>"<em>Anyway</em>," said Hermione in a loud voice. "Zabini took
with everyone who we thought was a spy, so in <em>our</em> army we
can stop watching each other quite so hard now, I hope."</p>
<p>"<em>Anthony</em> was a spy?" yelled Ron.</p>
<p>"<em>Parvati</em> was a spy?" gasped Hannah.</p>
<p>"Parvati was <em>totally</em> a spy," said Daphne. "She shopped
at the spy shoe store and wore spy lipstick, and someday she's
going to marry a nice spy husband and have a lot of little
spies."</p>
<p>And then a gong sound echoed through the water, indicating that
Sunshine had just scored two points.</p>
<p>This was shortly followed by the triple gong of Dragon losing a
single point.</p>
<p>Traitors weren't allowed to kill generals, not after the
disaster of the first battle in December when all three generals
had been shot in the first minute. But with any luck...</p>
<p>"Aw," said Hermione. "It sounds like Mr. Crabbe is taking a
little nap."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Like two shoals of fish, the armies swam along.</p>
<p>Neville Longbottom kicked his feet in slow, measured motions.
Diving, always diving in whatever direction you happened to be
moving. You wanted to show the enemy the smallest profile, present
them with your head or your feet. So you were always diving,
downward and head-first, and the enemy was always
<em>down.</em></p>
<p>Like every Chaos Legionnaire in the army, Neville's head was
constantly rotating as he swam, looking up, down, around, to every
side. Not just watching for Sunshine Soldiers, but watching for any
sign that a Chaos Legionnaire had drawn their wand and was about to
betray them. Usually traitors waited until the confusion of battle
to make their move, but that early gong had put them all on
guard.</p>
<p>...the truth was, Neville was feeling sad about that. In
November he'd been a soldier in a united army, all of them pulling
together and helping each other, and now they were all watching
each other constantly for the first signs of betrayal. It might
have been more fun for General Chaos, but it wasn't nearly as much
fun for Neville.</p>
<p>The direction formerly known as 'up' was getting steadily
brighter, as they came closer to the surface and Sunshine.</p>
<p>"Wands out," said General Chaos.</p>
<p>Neville's squad drew their wands, pointing them straight ahead
toward the enemy, as their heads scanned around more rapidly. If
there were Sunny traitors, the time was approaching for them to
strike.</p>
<p>The other shoal of fish, Dragon Army, was doing the same
thing.</p>
<p>"<em>Now!</em> " shouted the distant voice of the Dragon
General.</p>
<p>"<em>Now!</em> " shouted General Chaos.</p>
<p>"<em>For Sunshine!"</em> shouted all the soldiers in both
armies, and charged downward.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " said Minerva involuntarily as she watched the
screens from next to the lake, a cry echoed in many other places;
all of Hogwarts was watching this battle as they had watched the
first.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was laughing dryly. "I warned you,
Headmaster. It is impossible to have rules without Mr. Potter
exploiting them."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>For long precious seconds, as the forty-seven soldiers charged
her own seventeen, Hermione's mind went blank.</p>
<p>Why...</p>
<p>Then it all snapped into place.</p>
<p>Every time a soldier originally from Sunshine got shot by
someone crying the name of Sunshine, she would lose a Quirrell
point. When two Sunshine Soldiers were shot by either army,
<em>both</em> enemy armies would be two points closer to overtaking
her, it was the same gain only <em>shared</em>. And if anyone shot
another soldier <em>not</em> in the name of Sunshine, that gong
<em>wouldn't</em> get lost in the confusion...</p>
<p>Hermione was suddenly very glad that Zabini hadn't gone with the
obvious plan of starting trouble between the other two armies while
they attacked Sunshine.</p>
<p>It was still disheartening, though, that sense of your chances
closing down, of hope being taken away.</p>
<p>Most of Hermione's soldiers were still looking confused, but
some had expressions of dawning horror as they got it.</p>
<p>"It's all right," Susan Bones said firmly. Heads turned to look
at the Sunshine Captain. "Our job is the same, to take as many of
them with us as we can. And remember, Zabini took away all the
spies! We don't have to stay on the lookout like <em>they</em> do!"
The girl was smiling defiantly, provoking answering smiles from
many of the other soldiers, even from Hermione herself. "It can be
like it was in November. We just have to keep our heads high, fight
our best, and trust each other -"</p>
<p>Daphne shot her.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"<em>Blood for the blood god!</em> " shrieked Neville of Chaos,
though since he was underwater it came out more like 'Blubbled for
the blubbled glub!'</p>
<p>Captain Weasley spun and raised his wand toward Neville and
fired. But Neville was swimming <em>downward</em> toward him, wand
pointed straight ahead, and that meant the Simple Shield could
shelter Neville's entire profile; if anyone shot him now, it wasn't
going to be Sunny Ron.</p>
<p>A grimly determined look came over Captain Weasley's face, and
he arrowed straight up toward Neville, mouthing the word
<em>Contego,</em> though the shield wasn't visible in the
water.</p>
<p>The two enemy champions shot toward each other like arrows
released from bows, each aimed to split the other down the middle.
They had dueled many times before, but this time would pay for
all.</p>
<p>(Far away by the lakeside, a hundred breaths were held.)</p>
<p>"<em>Rainbows and unicorns!</em> " roared the Sunshine
Captain.</p>
<p>"<em>The Black Goat with a thousand young!</em> "</p>
<p>"<em>Do your homework!</em> "</p>
<p>Closer and yet closer, the two champions charged, neither
willing to swerve, the first person to turn would present a
vulnerable broadside and get shot, though if neither lost their
nerve they would crash right into each other...</p>
<p>Falling straight down as the enemy rose straight up to meet him,
hammer descending to meet anvil in a path neither was willing to
leave...</p>
<p>"<em>Special attack, Chaotic Twist!</em> "</p>
<p>Neville saw the look of horror on Captain Weasley's face as the
Hover Charm caught him. They'd tested it before the battle had
started; and just as Harry had suspected, <em>Wingardium
Leviosa</em> became a whole new sort of weapon once everyone was
swimming underwater.</p>
<p>"<em>Curse you, Longbottom!</em> " shrieked Ron Weasley,
"<em>Can't you ever fight without your dumb special attacks
-</em>"</p>
<p>and by that time the Sunshine Captain had been spun around
sideways and Neville shot him in the leg.</p>
<p>"I don't fight fair," said Neville to the sleeping form, "I
fight like Harry Potter."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Granger: 237 / Malfoy: 217 / Potter: 220</em></p>
<p>It still hurt every time he had to shoot Hermione. Harry could
hardly stand to look at the expression of peace that had come over
her sleeping face, arms now drifting aimlessly as the curves of
sunlight moved over her camouflage uniform and the cloud of her
chestnut hair.</p>
<p>And if Harry had tried to duck out of being the one to shoot
her... not only would Draco have known what it meant,
<em>Hermione</em> would have been offended.</p>
<p><em>She's not dead,</em> Harry said to his brain as his kicking
feet pushed him away, <em>she's just resting. IDIOT.</em></p>
<p><em>Are you sure?</em> said his brain. <em>What if she's an
ex-Hermione? Could we go back and check?</em></p>
<p>Harry glanced back briefly.</p>
<p><em>See, she's fine, there are bubbles coming out of her
mouth.</em></p>
<p><em>Could've been her last breath escaping.</em></p>
<p><em>Oh be quiet. Why are you being so paranoid-protective,
anyway?</em></p>
<p><em>Er, first real friend we've ever had in our whole life? Hey,
remember what happened to our pet rock?</em></p>
<p><em>Would you SHUT UP about that worthless lump of rubble, it
wasn't even alive let alone sentient, that is like the most
pathetic childhood trauma ever -</em></p>
<p>The two armies swiftly separated, becoming two shoals of fish
once more.</p>
<p>General Granger had gone down seventeen points, and taken three
Chaotics and two Dragons with her; and one Chaotic and two Dragons
had been shot as traitors. So she'd lost net seven points, Harry
had lost one, Draco had lost two; that put Sunshine twenty points
up on Dragon, and seventeen points up on Chaos. Chaos could still
win easily if they exterminated all twenty remaining Dragons. The
wild card, of course, being those seven remaining Sunshine
Soldiers...</p>
<p>...if you could call them that.</p>
<p>The two shoals swam uneasily next to each other, the soldiers in
each army awaiting an order to call out their true allegiances, and
attack...</p>
<p>"Everyone who got them," Harry said loudly, "remember Special
Orders One through Three. And don't forget it's Merlin Says on
Three. Do not acknowledge."</p>
<p>The trustworthy two-thirds of the army did not nod, and the
other third just looked puzzled.</p>
<p><em>Special Order One: Don't bother trying to call out any
codewords in this battle, don't expend effort on any plot not
specially approved by the commander; just swim, shield, and
fire.</em></p>
<p>Hermione and Draco had both been fighting their soldiers, trying
to get them to stop plotting on their own all through December.
Harry had egged his soldiers on and supported their plotting
through the last two battles... while also telling them that at
some <em>future</em> point he might ask them to put a plot or two
on hold, to which they'd all readily agreed. So now, in this
critical battle, they were happy to obey.</p>
<p>Neither Hermione or Draco could have given that order
successfully, Harry was certain. It was the difference between your
soldiers seeing you as an ally in their plotting, and seeing you as
a spoilsport old fuddy-duddy who didn't want them to have any fun.
Imposition of order equaled escalation of chaos, and it also worked
in reverse...</p>
<p>"There they are!" shouted someone, and pointed.</p>
<p>From the depths of the lake arose the forgotten ones, the ones
who'd forsaken the last battle, the seven missing Sunshine
Soldiers, glowing with the bright aura of cowards, now fading as
they returned to battle.</p>
<p>The two shoals of fish wavered, pointing wands uneasily.</p>
<p>"Hold your fire!" shouted Harry, and a similar cry came from
General Malfoy.</p>
<p>There was a moment of held breath.</p>
<p>Then the seven Sunshine Soldiers swam up to join Dragon
Army.</p>
<p>There was a triumphant cheer from Dragon Army.</p>
<p>There were cries of dismay from a third of the Chaos Legion.</p>
<p>Some of the other two-thirds smiled, though they shouldn't
have.</p>
<p>Harry wasn't smiling.</p>
<p><em>Oh, this is so completely not going to work...</em></p>
<p>But Harry hadn't been able to think of anything better.</p>
<p>"Special Orders Two and Three still apply!" shouted Harry.
"Fight!"</p>
<p>"<em>For the Chaos Legion!</em> " roared twenty Chaotic
Legionnaires.</p>
<p>"<em>For Dragon Army!</em> " roared twenty Dragon Warriors and
seven Sunshine Soldiers.</p>
<p>And the Chaotics dived straight downward, as all the traitors
got ready to strike.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Granger: 237 / Malfoy: 220 / Potter: 226</em></p>
<p>Draco's head darted around frantically, trying to weigh up what
was happening; somehow, despite his greater forces, he'd <em>lost
the initiative.</em> Four small Chaotic forces were being pursued
by four larger Dragon forces, but because Draco's forces were the
ones trying to force an engagement, it meant that they had to
<em>follow</em> where Chaos <em>ran,</em> and somehow that was
producing concentrations of Chaotic force that would fire into the
exposed sides of Dragon -</p>
<p>It was happening <em>again!</em></p>
<p>"<em>Prismatis!</em> " shouted Draco, raising his wand, and that
shield you could see even through the water, a sparkling
multicolored flat wall wide enough to shield Draco and the five
other Dragons with him from the Chaotic force that had just started
firing on them as they swam past, and <em>that</em> let the other
five Dragons turn <em>their</em> attentions back to the Chaotic
force they'd been chasing -</p>
<p>There was a tense moment as sleep spell after sleep spell
crashed into Draco's Prismatic Wall, and Draco was hoping to Merlin
that none of those four Chaotics had learned the Breaking Drill Hex
-</p>
<p>Then there was the bell of a Dragon victory, and the Chaotic
force spun head-for-foot and began swimming away; and Draco, his
hands now shaking slightly, dropped the Prismatic Wall and lowered
his wand.</p>
<p>Fighting in water was more exhausting even than fighting on
broomsticks.</p>
<p>"<em>Do not pursue!</em> " Draco cried to his soldiers as they
started to follow, then, "<em>Sonorus! REFORM ON ME!</em> "</p>
<p>The Dragon forces started converging on Draco, and the Chaotic
forces spun around and began <em>pursuing</em> the Dragons on the
instant - Draco swore out loud as he heard the bell of a Chaotic
victory, someone hadn't gotten their Simple Shield oriented right -
and then the Dragon forces were in supporting range of each other
and the Chaotics were moving back into the murky distance.</p>
<p>Somehow, despite their numerical superiority, the Dragons had
scored three times against the Chaotics and the Chaotics had scored
four times back, and he'd heard one Dragon spy get executed. Either
Harry Potter had thought of a lot of very good ideas very fast, or
for some unimaginable reason he'd already spent a lot of time
working out how to fight underwater. This wasn't working, and Draco
needed to rethink things.</p>
<p>It looked like everyone was having trouble aiming while
swimming, too, the battle might last long enough that time would be
called... the distant underwater moon was only half full now, that
wasn't good... he had to rethink things <em>fast...</em></p>
<p>"What is it?" said Padma Patil, as she and her force swam over
toward Draco.</p>
<p>Padma was his second-in-command; she was clever and powerful,
and better yet, she hated Granger and saw Harry as a rival, which
made her <em>trustworthy.</em> Working with Padma was making him
realize the truth of the old adage that Ravenclaw was sister to
Slytherin; Draco had been surprised when his father had told him it
was an acceptable House for his future wife, but now he saw the
sense of it.</p>
<p>"Wait until we're all here," Draco said. The truth was, he
needed to catch his breath. That was the trouble with being the
general <em>and</em> the most powerful wizard, you had to keep
using magic.</p>
<p>Zabini came in next, commanding a force of two Sunnies and four
Dragons, one of whom was Gregory keeping an eye on Zabini. Draco
didn't trust Zabini. And neither Draco nor Zabini trusted the
Sunnies enough to make them a majority of any unit; they were
<em>supposed</em> to be loyal either to Draco directly, or to
Granger who'd been fooled by the promise that the Dragons would be
betrayed in the end after both forces had been depleted, just as
Harry's more trusted Chaotics should've been fooled into not
shooting at the Sunnies by the promise of their firing fake Sleep
Hexes and switching to support Chaos later; but it was possible
some of the Sunnies <em>were</em> loyal to Chaos and
<em>weren't</em> firing real Sleep Hexes and that was why Dragon
wasn't winning the way their numerical advantage should've let them
win...</p>
<p>The next unit that approached was depleted, three soldiers
holding wands on two other soldiers, who were swimming with empty
hands.</p>
<p>Draco gritted his teeth. More traitor problems. He needed to
talk to Professor Quirrell about having some way to <em>punish</em>
traitors at least, conditions like these were <em>unrealistic</em>,
in real life you tortured your traitors to death.</p>
<p>"General Malfoy!" shouted the commander of the problem unit as
it swam up, a Ravenclaw boy named Terry. "We don't know what to do
- Cesi shot Bogdan, but Cesi says Kellah told him that Bogdan shot
Specter -"</p>
<p>"I <em>didn't!</em> " said Kellah.</p>
<p>"Yes you <em>did!</em> " shrieked Cesi. "General Malfoy,
<em>she's</em> the spy, I should've rea-"</p>
<p>"<em>Somnium,</em>" said Draco.</p>
<p>There was the triple bell of a one-point loss from Dragon, and
then Kellah's limp body began to float away in the water.</p>
<p>Draco <em>had</em> heard the word 'recursion' by this point, and
he knew a Harry Potter plot when he saw one.</p>
<p>(Unfortunately Draco had <em>not</em> heard of autoimmune
disorders, and the thought did <em>not</em> readily occur to him
that a clever virus would begin its attack by creating symptoms of
an autoimmune disorder so as to get the body to distrust its own
immune system...)</p>
<p>"<em>General order!</em> " said Draco, raising his voice.
"Nobody gets to shoot spies except myself, Gregory, Padma, and
Terry. If anyone sees anything suspicious they come to one of
<em>us.</em>"</p>
<p>And then -</p>
<p>There was the bell of Sunshine scoring two points.</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " said Draco and Zabini around the same time;
their heads swiveled around. No one seemed to have gotten hit, and
all the Sunshine soldiers were present and accounted for. (Except
Parvati, who had been shot by some still-unknown traitor in Padma's
squad; and of course Padma had shot Parvati again in case she was
faking, so it wasn't her...)</p>
<p>"A Sunny traitor in Chaos?" said Zabini, sounding puzzled. "But
all the ones I knew about were supposed to strike during Chaos's
attack on Sunshine -"</p>
<p>"No!" said Padma in a tone of sudden realization. "That was
<em>Chaos</em> executing a spy!"</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " said Zabini. "But why -"</p>
<p>And Draco got it. <em>Damn it!</em> "Because Potter thinks he's
safe for how much he beats Sunshine, but not for how much he beats
<em>us!</em> So he doesn't want to lose a single point when he
executes a traitor! <em>General order!</em> If you have to execute
a traitor, call Sunshine first! And don't forget to switch back to
Dragon afterward -"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Granger: 253 / Malfoy: 252 / Potter: 252</em></p>
<p>Longbottom's body drifted chaotically through the water, arms
and legs disarrayed. After Draco had finally got a hit in they'd
all shot him <em>again</em> just to be sure.</p>
<p>Nearby was Harry Potter, now protected by a Prismatic Sphere,
looking at them all grimly as the last sliver of crescent moon
slowly diminished, somewhere far away. If Longbottom had managed to
shoot one more soldier (Draco knew Harry was thinking), if the two
Chaotics had managed to hold out just a little longer, they might
have <em>won</em>...</p>
<p>After Draco had reformed his forces and struck out again, the
ensuing battle and execution of spies in Sunshine's name had left
Sunshine exactly one point ahead of Dragon and Chaos both. Once
Harry had started doing it, Draco had been left with no choice but
to follow suit.</p>
<p>But now they had General Chaos outnumbered three to one, the
survivors of Dragon Army and the last remaining Sunny traitor:
Draco, and Padma, and Zabini.</p>
<p>And Draco, who was no fool, had ordered Padma to take Zabini's
wand after Longbottom had shot Gregory and fallen in turn to Draco.
The boy had given him an insulted look, told Draco that he owed him
for this, and handed it over.</p>
<p>That left Draco and Padma to take down General Chaos.</p>
<p>"I don't suppose you'd like to surrender?" said Draco, smiling
as evilly as any smile he'd ever directed at Harry Potter.</p>
<p>"Sleep before surrender!" shouted General Chaos.</p>
<p>"Just so you know," said Draco, "Zabini doesn't actually
<em>have</em> an older sister for you to rescue from Gryffindor
bullies. But Zabini <em>does</em> have a mother who doesn't approve
of Muggleborns like Granger, and I wrote her a few notes, and
offered Zabini a few favors - nothing involving my father, just
things <em>I</em> can do in school. And by the way, Zabini's mother
doesn't approve of the Boy-Who-Lived, either. Just in case you
still thought Zabini was really on your side."</p>
<p>Harry's face grew even grimmer.</p>
<p>Draco raised his wand, and began breathing rhythmically,
building up strength for a Breaking Drill Hex. Granger's Prismatic
Sphere was almost as strong as Draco's now, and Harry's wasn't much
weaker, where did those two find <em>time?</em></p>
<p>"<em>Lagann!</em> " spoke Draco, putting everything he had into
it, and the green spiral blazed out and Harry's shield shattered,
and at almost the same moment -</p>
<p>"<em>Somnium!</em> " said Padma.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Granger: 253 / Malfoy: 252 / Potter: 254</em></p>
<p>Harry let out a long breath of relief, and not just because he
didn't have to hold the Prismatic Sphere any more. His hand was
shaking as he lowered his wand.</p>
<p>"You know," said Harry, "I was pretty worried there for a
moment."</p>
<p><em>Special Order Two: If a Sunny traitor doesn't seem to be
really shooting at you, fake being hit occasionally. Prefer
targeting Dragons to Sunnies but go ahead and shoot Sunnies if you
can't shoot Dragons.</em></p>
<p><em>Special Order Three: Merlin says do not shoot at Blaise
Zabini or either Patil twin.</em></p>
<p>With a wide grin, Parvati Patil stripped the Transfigured patch
off her uniform's insignia, and let it float away in the water.</p>
<p>"Gryffindors for Chaos," she said, and handed Zabini his wand
back.</p>
<p>"Thank you <em>very</em> much," Harry said, and bowed sweepingly
to the Gryffindor girl. "And thank <em>you</em> as well," bowing to
Zabini. "You know, when you came to me with that plan, I wondered
if you were brilliant or crazy, and I've decided that you're both.
And by the way," Harry said, now turning as though to address
Draco's body, "Zabini <em>does</em> have a cousin -"</p>
<p>"<em>Somnium,</em>" said Zabini's voice.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Granger: 255 / Malfoy: 252 / Potter: 254</em></p>
<p>And Harry Potter's body floated away, his expression of shock
and horror quickly relaxing into sleep.</p>
<p>"On second thought," Parvati said cheerfully, "make that
Gryffindors for Sunshine."</p>
<p>She started to laugh, more exhiliarated than she'd ever been in
her life, she'd <em>finally</em> gotten to assassinate and replace
her twin sister and she'd wanted to do that since <em>forever,</em>
and this had been <em>perfect,</em> it had all been
<em>perfect</em> -</p>
<p>- and then her wand spun around in a lightning motion just as
Zabini's wand turned to point at her.</p>
<p>"Wait!" said Zabini. "Do not shoot, do not resist. That's an
order."</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " said Parvati.</p>
<p>"Sorry," said Zabini, looking not-quite-sincerely apologetic,
"but I can't be totally <em>sure</em> you're for Sunshine. So I
order you to let me shoot you."</p>
<p>"<em>Hold on!</em> " said Parvati. "We're only ahead of Chaos by
one point! If you shoot me now -"</p>
<p>"I'll shoot you in the name of Dragon, <em>obviously</em>," said
Zabini, now sounding a little superior. "Just because we tricked
<em>them</em> into doing it, doesn't mean it won't work for
us."</p>
<p>Parvati stared at him, her eyes narrowing. "General Malfoy said
your mother doesn't like Hermione."</p>
<p>"I suppose," said Zabini, still with that superior smirk. "But
some of us are more willing than Draco Malfoy to annoy a
parent."</p>
<p>"And Harry Potter said you have a cousin -"</p>
<p>"Nope," said Zabini.</p>
<p>Parvati stared at him, trying to think, but she wasn't really
good at plotting; Zabini'd said the plan was to secretly keep the
scores of Chaos and Dragon as even as possible so they'd use
Sunshine's name to execute their traitors instead of losing even a
single point, and that had <em>worked</em>... but... she had the
feeling she was missing something, she wasn't a Slytherin...</p>
<p>"Why don't <em>I</em> shoot <em>you</em> in the name of Dragon?"
said Parvati.</p>
<p>"Because I outrank you," said Zabini.</p>
<p>Parvati had a bad feeling about this.</p>
<p>She stared at him for a long moment.</p>
<p>And then -</p>
<p>"<em>Somni-</em>" she started to say, and then realized she
hadn't said <em>for Dragon,</em> and frantically cut herself off
-</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Granger: 255 / Malfoy: 254 / Potter: 254</em></p>
<p>"Hey, everyone," said Blaise Zabini's face on the screens,
looking quite amused, "guess it's all down to me."</p>
<p>All by the lakeside, people were holding their breath.</p>
<p>Sunshine was ahead of Dragon and Chaos by exactly one point.</p>
<p>Blaise Zabini could shoot himself in the name of either Dragon
or Chaos, or just leave things the way they were.</p>
<p>A series of chimes indicated that the last minute of time was
running out.</p>
<p>And the Slytherin was smiling a strange, twisted smile, and
casually toying with his wand, the dark wood barely visible in the
dark water.</p>
<p>"You know," said Blaise Zabini's voice, in the tones of someone
who'd been rehearsing the words for a while, "it's just a game,
really. And games are supposed to be <em>fun.</em> So how about if
I just do whatever I feel like?"</p>

<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 34: Coordination Problems, Pt
2<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>Minerva and Dumbledore together had applied their combined
talent to conjure the grand stage toward which Quirrell now slowly
trudged; it was, at its core, sturdy wood, but the outer surfaces
shone with glitter of marble inlaid with platinum and studded with
gems of every House color. Neither she nor the Headmaster was any
Founder of Hogwarts, but the conjuration only needed to last a few
hours. Minerva ordinarily enjoyed the few occasions when she had
the occasion to tire herself out on large Transfigurations; she
should have enjoyed the many small chances for artistry, and the
illusion of opulence; but this time she had done the work with the
dreadful feeling of digging her own grave.</p>
<p>But Minerva was feeling a little better now. There'd been one
brief moment when the explosion might've come; but Dumbledore had
already been standing up and applauding warmly, and no one had
proven foolish enough to riot in front of the Headmaster.</p>
<p>And the explosive mood had rapidly faded into a collective
sentiment which might perhaps have been described by the phrase:
<em>Give us a break!</em></p>
<p>Blaise Zabini had shot himself in the name of Sunshine, and the
final score had been 254 to 254 to 254.<em><br></em></p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Behind the stage, waiting to ascend, three children were glaring
at each other in mingled fury and frustration. It didn't help that
they were still damp from being fished out of the lake, and that
the Warming Charms didn't seem quite enough to make up for the
crisp December air, or maybe it was just their mood.</p>
<p>"That's <em>it</em>," said Granger. "I've <em>had</em> it! No
more traitors!"</p>
<p>"I completely agree with you, Miss Granger," Draco said icily.
"Enough is enough."</p>
<p>"And what do <em>you</em> two intend to do about it?" snapped
Harry Potter. "Professor Quirrell already said he wouldn't ban
spies!"</p>
<p>"We'll ban them <em>for</em> him," said Draco grimly. He hadn't
even understood what he meant by the words as he said them, but the
very act of speaking seemed to crystallize a plan -</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The stage really was well done, at least for a temporary
structure; the makers hadn't fallen into the usual pitfall of being
impressed by their own illusion of wealth, and knew something about
architecture and visual style. From where Draco stood, in the
obvious place for him to stand, the watching students would see him
haloed in the faint glitter of emeralds; and Granger, standing
where Draco had subtly motioned her, would be haloed in Ravenclaw's
sapphire. As for Harry Potter, Draco wasn't looking at him right
now.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell had... awakened, or whatever it was he did;
and was leaning upon a platinum podium bare of all gems. With
evident showmanship, the Defense Professor was carefully stacking
and squaring those three envelopes containing the three parchments
upon which the three generals had written their wishes, as all the
students of Hogwarts watched, and waited.</p>
<p>Finally Professor Quirrell looked up from the envelopes. "Well,"
said the Defense Professor. "This is inconvenient."</p>
<p>A slight titter of laughter ran through the crowd, with a sharp
undertone.</p>
<p>"I suppose you are all wondering what I will do?" said Professor
Quirrell. "There is nothing for it; I shall have to do what is
fair. Although first there was a little speech I wanted to make,
and before even that, it appears to me that Mr. Malfoy and Miss
Granger have something they wish to share."</p>
<p>Draco blinked, and then he and Granger traded rapid glances -
<em>may I?</em> - <em>yes, go ahead -</em> and Draco raised his
voice.</p>
<p>"General Granger and I would both like to say," Draco said in
his most formal voice, knowing it was being amplified and heard,
"that we will no longer accept the help of any traitors. And if, in
any battle, we find that Potter has accepted traitors from either
of our armies, we will join forces to crush him."</p>
<p>And Draco shot a glance filled at malice at the Boy-Who-Lived.
<em>Take that, General Chaos!</em></p>
<p>"I agree completely with General Malfoy," said Granger standing
beside him, her high voice clear and strong. "Neither of us will
use traitors, and if General Potter does, we will wipe him off the
battlefield."</p>
<p>There was a susurration of surprise from the watching
students.</p>
<p>"Very good," said their Defense Professor, smiling. "It took the
two of you long enough, but you are still to be congratulated on
having thought of it before any other generals."</p>
<p>It took a moment for this to soak in -</p>
<p>"In the future, Mr. Malfoy, Miss Granger, before you come to my
office with any request, consider whether there is a way for you to
accomplish it without my help. I will not deduct Quirrell points on
this occasion, but next time you may expect to lose the full
fifty." Professor Quirrell wore an amused grin. "And what do you
have to say about that, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>Harry Potter's gaze went to Granger, then to Draco. His face
appeared calm; though Draco was sure <em>controlled</em> would have
been the better term.</p>
<p>Finally Harry Potter spoke, his voice level. "The Chaos Legion
is still happy to accept traitors. See you on the battlefield."</p>
<p>Draco knew the shock was showing on his own face; there were
astonished murmurs from the watching students, and when Draco
glanced at the front row he saw that even Harry's Chaotics looked
taken aback.</p>
<p>Granger's face was angry, and getting angrier. "Mr. Potter," she
said in a sharp tone like she thought she was a teacher, "are you
<em>trying</em> to be obnoxious?"</p>
<p>"Most certainly not," Harry Potter said calmly. "I won't make
you do it every time. Beat me once, and I'll stay beaten. But
threats aren't always enough, General of Sunshine. You did not ask
me to join with you, but tried simply to impose your will; and
sometimes you must actually defeat the enemy, to impose your will
on him. You see, I am skeptical that Hermione Granger, the
brightest academic star of Hogwarts, and Draco, son of Lucius,
scion of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy, can work
together to beat their common foe, Harry Potter." An amused smile
crossed Harry Potter's face. "Maybe I'll just do what Draco tried
with Zabini, and write a letter to Lucius Malfoy and see what
<em>he</em> thinks about that."</p>
<p>"<em>Harry!</em> " gasped Granger, looking absolutely aghast,
and there were gasps from the audience as well.</p>
<p>Draco controlled the anger flushing through him. That had been a
<em>stupid</em> move on Harry's part, saying that in public. If
Harry had simply <em>done</em> it, it might have worked, Draco
hadn't even thought about that, but <em>now</em> if Father did that
it would look like he was playing into Harry's hands -</p>
<p>"If you think my father, Lord Malfoy, can be manipulated by
<em>you</em> that easily," Draco said coldly, "you have a surprise
coming, Harry Potter."</p>
<p>And Draco realized as the words finished leaving his mouth that
he'd just backed <em>his own father</em> squarely into the corner,
more or less without even meaning to. Father probably
<em>wasn't</em> going to like this, not the tiniest bit, but now it
would be impossible for him to say so... Draco would have to
apologize for that, it <em>had</em> been an honest accident, but it
was strange to think that he'd done it at all.</p>
<p>"Then go ahead and defeat the evil General Chaos," Harry said,
still looking amused. "I can't win against both your armies - not
if you <em>really</em> work together. But I wonder if perhaps I
could break you up before then."</p>
<p>"You won't, and we'll <em>crush</em> you!" said Draco
Malfoy.</p>
<p>And beside him, Hermione Granger firmly nodded.</p>
<p>"Well," said Professor Quirrell after the astounded silence had
stretched for a while. "That was <em>not</em> how I expected that
particular conversation to go." The Defense Professor had a rather
intrigued expression on his face. "Truthfully, Mr. Potter, I
expected you to concede immediately and with a smile, then announce
that you had long since worked out my intended lesson but had
decided not to spoil it for others. Indeed, I planned my speech
accordingly, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>Harry Potter just shrugged. "Sorry about that," he said, and
said nothing more.</p>
<p>"Oh, don't worry," said Professor Quirrell. "This, too, will
serve."</p>
<p>And Professor Quirrell turned from the three children, and
straightened at the podium to address the whole watching crowd; his
customary air of detached amusement dropped away like a falling
mask, and when he spoke again his voice was amplified louder than
it had been.</p>
<p>"If not for Harry Potter," said Professor Quirrell, his voice as
crisp and cold as December, "You-Know-Who would have won."</p>
<p>The silence was instant, and total.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"Make no mistake," said Professor Quirrell. "The Dark Lord
<em>was</em> winning. There were fewer and fewer Aurors who dared
face him, the vigilantes who opposed him were being hunted down.
One Dark Lord and perhaps fifty Death Eaters were <em>winning</em>
against a country of thousands. That is beyond ridiculous! There
are no grades low enough for me to mark that incompetence!"</p>
<p>There was a frown on the face of Headmaster Dumbledore; and on
the faces of the audience, puzzlement; and the utter silence went
on.</p>
<p>"Do you understand now how it happened? You saw it today. I
allowed traitors, and gave the generals no means to restrain them.
You saw the result. Clever plots and clever betrayals, until the
last soldier left on the battlefield shot himself! You cannot
<em>possibly</em> doubt that all three of those armies could have
been defeated by <em>any</em> outside foe that was unified within
itself."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell leaned forward at the podium, his voice now
filled with a grim intensity. His right hand stretched out, fingers
open and spread. "Division is weakness," said the Defense
Professor. His hand closed into a tight fist. "Unity is strength.
The Dark Lord understood that well, whatever his other follies; and
he <em>used</em> that understanding to create the one simple
invention that made him the most terrible Dark Lord in history.
Your parents faced one Dark Lord. And fifty Death Eaters who were
perfectly unified, knowing that any breach of their loyalty would
be punished by death, that any slack or incompetence would be
punished by pain. None could escape the Dark Lord's grasp once they
took his Mark. And the Death Eaters agreed to take that terrible
Mark because they knew that once they took it, they would be
<em>united</em>, facing a divided land. One Dark Lord and fifty
Death Eaters would have defeated an entire country, by the power of
the Dark Mark."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's voice was bleak and hard. "Your parents
<em>could</em> have fought back in kind. They did not. There was a
man named Yermy Wibble who called upon the nation to institute a
draft, though he did not quite have vision enough to propose a Mark
of Britain. Yermy Wibble knew what would happen to him; he hoped
his death would inspire others. So the Dark Lord took his family
for good measure. Their empty skins inspired nothing but fear, and
no one dared to speak again. And your parents would have faced the
consequences of their despicable cowardice, if not for being saved
by a one-year-old boy." Professor Quirrell's face showed full
contempt. "A dramatist would have called that a <em>dei ex
machina,</em> for they did nothing to earn their salvation.
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named may not have deserved to win, but make no
doubt of it, your parents deserved to lose."</p>
<p>The voice of the Defense Professor rang forth like iron. "And
know this: your parents have learned nothing! The nation is still
fragmented and weak! How few decades passed between Grindelwald and
You-Know-Who? Do you think <em>you</em> will not see the next
threat in your own lifetimes? Will <em>you</em> repeat then the
follies of your parents, when you have seen the results so clearly
laid out before you this day? For I can tell you what your parents
will do, when the day of darkness comes! I can tell you what lesson
they have learned! They have learned to hide like cowards and do
nothing while they wait for Harry Potter to save them!"</p>
<p>There was a wondering look in the eyes of Headmaster Dumbledore;
and other students gazed up at their Defense Professor with
bewilderment and anger and awe.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's eyes were as cold now as his voice. "Mark
this, and mark it well. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named wished to rule
over this country, to hold it in his cruel grasp forever. But at
least he wished to rule over a <em>living</em> country, and not a
heap of ash! There have been Dark Lords who were mad, who wished
only to make the world a vast funeral pyre! There have been wars in
which one whole country marched against another! Your parents
nearly lost against half a hundred, who thought to take this
country alive! How quickly would they have been crushed by a foe
more numerous than they, a foe that cared for nothing but their
destruction? This I foretell: When the next threat rises, Lucius
Malfoy will claim that you must follow him or perish, that your
only hope is to trust in his cruelty and strength. And though
Lucius Malfoy himself will believe it, this will be a lie. For when
the Dark Lord perished, Lucius Malfoy did not unite the Death
Eaters, they were shattered in an instant, they fled like whipped
dogs and betrayed each other! Lucius Malfoy is not strong enough to
be a true Lord, Dark or otherwise."</p>
<p>Draco Malfoy's fists were clenched white, there were tears in
his eyes, and fury, and unbearable shame.</p>
<p>"No," said Professor Quirrell, "I do not think it will be Lucius
Malfoy who saves you. And lest you think that I speak on my own
behalf, time will make clear soon enough that this is not so. I
make you no recommendation, my students. But I say that if a whole
country were to find a leader as strong as the Dark Lord, but
honorable and pure, and take his Mark; then they could crush any
Dark Lord like an insect, and all the rest of our divided magical
world could not threaten them. And if some still greater enemy rose
against us in a war of extermination, then only a united magical
world could survive."</p>
<p>There were gasps, mostly from Muggleborns; the students in
green-trimmed robes looked merely puzzled. Now it was Harry Potter
whose fists were clenched tight and trembling; and Hermione Granger
beside him was angry and dismayed.</p>
<p>The Headmaster rose from his seat, his face now stern, saying no
word as yet; but the command was clear.</p>
<p>"I do not say <em>what</em> threat will come," said Professor
Quirrell. "But you will not live all your lives in peace, not if
the past history of the world is any guide at all to its future.
And if you do in the future as you have seen three armies do this
day, if you cannot throw aside your petty bickering and take the
Mark of a single leader, then indeed you might wish that the Dark
Lord had lived to rule over you, and regret the day that ever Harry
Potter was born -"</p>
<p>"<em>Enough!</em> " bellowed Albus Dumbledore.</p>
<p>There was silence.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell slowly turned his head to gaze at where Albus
Dumbledore stood in the fury of his wizardry; their eyes met, and a
soundless stress pressed down like weight upon all the students, as
they listened not daring to move.</p>
<p>"You, too, failed this country," said Professor Quirrell. "And
you know the peril as well as I."</p>
<p>"Such speeches are not for the ears of students," said Albus
Dumbledore in a dangerously rising voice. "Nor for the mouths of
professors!"</p>
<p>Dryly, then, Professor Quirrell spoke: "There were many speeches
made for the ears of adults, as the Dark Lord rose. And the adults
clapped and cheered, and went home having enjoyed their day's
entertainment. But I will obey you, Headmaster, and make no further
speeches if you do not like them. My lesson is simple. I will go on
doing nothing about traitors, and we will see what students can do
for themselves about that, when they do not wait for professors to
save them."</p>
<p>And then Professor Quirrell turned back to his students, and his
mouth quirked up in a wry grin that seemed to dissipate the
dreadful pressure like a god blowing to scatter the clouds. "But do
please be kind to the traitors up until now," said Professor
Quirrell. "They were just having fun."</p>
<p>There was laughter, though it was nervous at first, and then it
seemed to build, as Professor Quirrell stood there smiling wryly
and some of the tension released itself.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Draco's mind was still whirling through a thousand questions and
a daze of horror, as Professor Quirrell prepared to open the
envelopes in which the three had inscribed their wishes.</p>
<p>It had never before occurred to Draco that moon-traveling
Muggles were a greater threat than the slow decline of wizardry, or
that Father had proven himself too weak to stop them.</p>
<p>And even stranger, the obvious implication: Professor Quirrell
believed that <em>Harry</em> could. The Defense Professor claimed
to have made no recommendation, but he'd mentioned Harry Potter
over and over in his speech; others would already be thinking the
same thing as Draco.</p>
<p>It was ridiculous. The boy who had covered a stuffed chair in
glitter and called it a throne -</p>
<p><em>The boy who faced down Snape and won,</em> whispered a
traitorous voice, <em>that boy could grow into a Lord strong enough
to rule, strong enough to save us all -</em></p>
<p>Harry had been <em>raised</em> by Muggles! He was practically a
mudblood himself, he wouldn't fight against his adopted family
-</p>
<p><em>He knows their arts, their secrets and their methods; he can
take all of the Muggles' science and use it against them, alongside
our own power as wizards.</em></p>
<p>But what if he refuses? What if he's too weak?</p>
<p><em>Then,</em> said that inner voice, <em>it will have to be
you, won't it, Draco Malfoy?</em></p>
<p>And then there was a renewed hush from the crowd, as Professor
Quirrell opened the first envelope.</p>
<p>"Mr. Malfoy," said Professor Quirrell, "your wish is for...
Slytherin to win the House Cup."</p>
<p>There was a puzzled pause from the watching audience.</p>
<p>"Yes, Professor," said Draco in a clear voice, knowing that it
was once again being amplified. "If you can't do that, then
something else for Slytherin -"</p>
<p>"I will not award House points unfairly," said Professor
Quirrell. He tapped a cheek, looking thoughtful. "Which makes your
wish difficult enough to be interesting. Would you like to say
anything about why, Mr. Malfoy?"</p>
<p>Draco turned from the Defense Professor, gazed out at the crowd
from against that backdrop of platinum and emeralds. Not all of
Slytherin had cheered for Dragon Army, there were anti-Malfoy
factions who had expressed that dissatisfaction by supporting the
Boy-Who-Lived, or even Granger; and those factions would be
encouraged greatly by what Zabini had done. He needed to remind
them that Slytherin meant Malfoy and Malfoy meant Slytherin -</p>
<p>"No," said Draco. "They're Slytherins, they'll understand."</p>
<p>There was some laughter from the audience, especially in
Slytherin, even from some students who would have called themselves
anti-Malfoy a moment earlier.</p>
<p>Flattery was a lovely thing.</p>
<p>Draco turned back to look at Professor Quirrell again, and was
surprised to see an embarrassed look on Granger's face.</p>
<p>"And for Miss Granger..." said Professor Quirrell. There was the
sound of a tearing envelope. "Your wish is for... Ravenclaw to win
the House Cup?"</p>
<p>There was considerable laughter from the audience, including a
chuckle from Draco. He hadn't thought Granger played that game.</p>
<p>"Well, um," said Granger, sounding like she was suddenly
stumbling over a memorized speech, "I meant to say, that..." She
took a deep breath. "There were soldiers from every House in my
army, and I don't mean to slight any of them. But Houses should
still count for something, too. It was sad when students in the
same House were hexing each other just because they were in
different armies. People should be able to rely on whoever's in
their House. That's why Godric Gryffindor, and Salazar Slytherin,
and Rowena Ravenclaw, and Helga Hufflepuff created the four Houses
of Hogwarts in the first place. I'm the General of Sunshine, but
even before that, I'm Hermione Granger of Ravenclaw, and I'm proud
to be part of a House that's eight hundred years old."</p>
<p>"Well said, Miss Granger!" said Dumbledore's booming voice.</p>
<p>Harry Potter was frowning, and something tickled at the edge of
Draco's recognition.</p>
<p>"An interesting sentiment, Miss Granger," said Professor
Quirrell. "But there are times when it is good for a Slytherin to
have friends in Ravenclaw, or for a Gryffindor to have friends in
Hufflepuff. Surely it would be best if you could rely both on your
friends in your House, and also your friends in your army?"</p>
<p>Granger's eyes flicked briefly toward the watching students and
teachers, and she said nothing.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell nodded as though to himself, and then turned
back to the podium, and took up and tore open the last envelope.
Beside Draco, Harry Potter visibly tensed up as the Defense
Professor drew forth the parchment. "And Mr. Potter wishes for
-"</p>
<p>There was a pause as Professor Quirrell looked at the
parchment.</p>
<p>Then, without any change of expression on Professor Quirrell's
face, the sheet of parchment burst into flames, and burned with a
brief, intense fire that left only drifting black dust sprinkling
down from his hand.</p>
<p>"Please confine yourself to the possible, Mr. Potter," said
Professor Quirrell, sounding very dry indeed.</p>
<p>There was a long pause; Harry, standing beside Draco, looked
rather shaken.</p>
<p><em>What in Merlin's name did he ask for?</em></p>
<p>"I do hope," said Professor Quirrell, "that you prepared another
wish, if I could not grant that one."</p>
<p>There was another pause.</p>
<p>Harry drew a deep breath. "I didn't," he said, "but I already
thought of another one." Harry Potter turned to look out at the
audience, and his voice firmed as he spoke. "People fear traitors
because of the damage the traitor does directly, the soldiers they
shoot or the secrets they tell. But that's only part of the danger.
What people do because they're <em>afraid</em> of traitors also
costs them. I used that strategy today against Sunshine and Dragon.
I didn't tell my traitors to cause as much direct damage as
possible. I told them to act in the way that would create the most
distrust and confusion, and make the generals do the most costly
things to try and stop them from doing it again. When there are
just a few traitors and a whole country opposing them, it stands to
reason that what a few traitors do might be less damaging than what
a whole country does to stop them, that the cure might be worse
than the disease -"</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter," said the Defense Professor, his voice suddenly
cutting, "the lesson of history is that you are simply wrong. Your
parents' generation did too little to unify themselves, not too
much! This whole country almost fell, Mr. Potter, though you were
not there to see it. I suggest that you ask your dorm-mates in
Ravenclaw how many of them have lost family to the Dark Lord. Or if
you are wiser, do <em>not</em> ask! <em>Do</em> you have a wish to
make, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>"If you don't mind," said the mild voice of Albus Dumbledore, "I
should like to hear what the Boy-Who-Lived has to say. He has more
experience than either of us at stopping wars."</p>
<p>A few people laughed, but not many.</p>
<p>Harry Potter's gaze moved to Dumbledore, and he looked
considering for a moment. "I'm not saying you're wrong, Professor
Quirrell. In the last war, people didn't act together, and a whole
country almost fell to a few dozen attackers, and yes, that was
pathetic. And if we make the same mistake next time, yes, that'll
be even more pathetic. But you never fight the same war twice. And
the problem is, the enemy is <em>also</em> allowed to be smart. If
you're divided you're vulnerable in one way; but when you try to
unite, then you face other risks, and other costs, and the enemy
will try to take advantage of those, too. You can't stop thinking
at just one level of the game."</p>
<p>"Simplicity also has a great deal to commend it, Mr. Potter,"
said the dry voice of the Defense Professor. "I do hope that you
have learned something this day about the dangers of strategies
more complicated than uniting your people and attacking your enemy.
And if all this does not tie into your wish somehow, I shall be
quite annoyed."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Harry Potter, "it was pretty difficult coming up
with a wish to symbolize the costs of unity. But the problem of
acting together isn't just for wars, it's something we have to
solve all our lives, every day. If everyone is coordinating using
the same rules, and the rules are stupid, then if <em>one</em>
person decides to do things differently, they're breaking the
rules. But if <em>everyone</em> decides to do things differently,
they can. It's exactly the same problem of everyone needing to act
together. But for the <em>first</em> person who speaks out, it
seems like they're going against the crowd. And if you thought that
the only important thing was that people should always be unified,
then you could never change the game, no matter how stupid the
rules. So my own wish, to symbolize what happens when people unite
in the wrong direction, is that in Hogwarts we should play
Quidditch without the Snitch."</p>
<p>"<em>WHAT?</em> " screamed a hundred voices in the crowd, as
Draco's jaw dropped.</p>
<p>"The Snitch ruins the whole game," said Harry Potter.
"Everything the other players do ends up being irrelevant. It would
make overwhelmingly more sense to just buy a clock. It's one of
those incredibly stupid things you don't notice just because you
grew up with it, that people only do because everyone else is doing
it -"</p>
<p>But by that point Harry Potter's voice could no longer be heard,
because the riot had started.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The riot ended around fifteen seconds later, after a gigantic
spout of fire blasted out of the highest tower of Hogwarts to the
sound of a hundred thunders. Draco hadn't known Dumbledore could
<em>do</em> that.</p>
<p>The students sat down again very carefully and quietly.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was laughing, without pause. "So be it, Mr.
Potter. Your will be done." The Defense Professor paused
deliberately. "Of course, I only promised <em>one</em> cunning
plot. And that is all that the three of you will get."</p>
<p>Draco had been half-expecting the words earlier, but now they
still came as a shock; Draco exchanged rapid glances with Granger,
they would have been the obvious allies but their wishes were
directly opposed -</p>
<p>"You mean," said Harry, "we have to all agree on a wish?"</p>
<p>"Oh, that would be <em>far</em> too much to ask," said Professor
Quirrell. "The three of you have no common enemy, do you?"</p>
<p>And for one brief moment, so fast that Draco thought he might
have imagined it, the Defense Professor's eyes flicked in the
direction of Dumbledore.</p>
<p>"No," said Professor Quirrell, "I mean that I shall grant three
wishes using a single plot."</p>
<p>There was a confused silence.</p>
<p>"You can't do that," Harry said flatly from beside Draco. "Not
even <em>I</em> can do that. Two of those wishes are mutually
incompatible. It's <em>logically impossible -</em>" and then Harry
cut himself off.</p>
<p>"You're a few years too young to tell me what I can't do, Mr.
Potter," said Professor Quirrell, with a brief dry smile.</p>
<p>Then the Defense Professor turned back to the watching students.
"Truthfully, I have no confidence in your ability to learn this
day's lesson. Go home, and enjoy your time with your families, or
what's left of them, while they still live. My own family is long
since dead at the Dark Lord's hand. I shall see you all when
classes resume."</p>
<p>In the speechless silence that resulted, Professor Quirrell
already turning to walk off the stage, Draco heard the Defense
Professor's voice say, quietly and no longer amplified, "But you,
Mr. Potter, I would speak to now."</p>

<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry paced backward and forward in his general's office, which
made a wonderful room for pacing, it didn't have any other uses as
far as he could tell.</p>
<p><em>How?</em></p>
<p><em>How?</em></p>
<p>Hermione shouldn't have won that battle! Not on her first try,
not when she wasn't at all violent by her nature, automatically
being a great military commander on top of everything else was too
much even for <em>her</em>.</p>
<p>Had she read about the tactic in a military history book? But it
hadn't been just that one tactic, she'd had her forces perfectly
positioned to block any retreat, her troops had been better
coordinated than his <em>or</em> Draco's...</p>
<p>Had Professor Quirrell broken his promise not to help her? Had
he given her the diary of General Tacticus or something?</p>
<p>Harry was missing something here, something really important,
and his mind went around and around in circles, and he still
couldn't figure it out.</p>
<p>Finally Harry sighed. He wasn't getting anywhere on this, and he
had to go learn the Breaking Drill Hex from Hermione or someone
before the next battle - Professor Quirrell had explained to Harry,
his voice amused but with a sharp undertone of warning, that "no
magical items except the ones I give you" included Muggle
technology no matter how much that <em>wasn't magic.</em> Plus
Harry also needed to figure out how to bring down Mr. Goyle next
time...</p>
<p>Battles counted for a lot of Quirrell points if you were a
general, and Harry needed to get cracking if he wanted to win
Professor Quirrell's Christmas wish.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>In his private room at Slytherin, Draco Malfoy stared off into
space, as though the wall in front of his desk was the most
fascinating surface in the world.</p>
<p><em>How?</em></p>
<p><em>How?</em></p>
<p>In retrospect it had been an obvious sort of idea as cunning
plots went, but Granger wasn't <em>supposed</em> to be cunning!
She'd been too much of a Hufflepuff to use a Simple Strike Hex! Had
Professor Quirrell been advising her despite his promise, or...</p>
<p>And then Draco finally did what he should have done much
earlier.</p>
<p>What he should have done after the first time he met with
Granger.</p>
<p>What Harry Potter had <em>told</em> him to do, <em>trained</em>
him to do, and yet Harry had also warned Draco that it would take
time to make his brain realize that the methods applied to real
life, and Draco hadn't <em>understood</em> that until today. He
could have avoided every single one of his mistakes if he'd just
<em>applied</em> the things Harry had already <em>told</em> him
-</p>
<p>Draco said out loud, "I notice that I am confused."</p>
<p><em>Your strength as a rationalist is your ability to be more
confused by fiction than by reality...</em></p>
<p>Draco was confused.</p>
<p>Therefore, something he believed was fiction.</p>
<p>Granger should not have been able to do all that.</p>
<p>Therefore, she probably hadn't.</p>
<p><em>I promise not to help General Granger in any way that the
two of you don't know about.</em></p>
<p>With sudden horrified realization, Draco swept papers out of the
way, hunting through the mess on his desk, until he found it.</p>
<p>And there it was.</p>
<p>Right in the list of people and equipment assigned to each of
the three armies.</p>
<p><em>Curse</em> Professor Quirrell!</p>
<p>Draco had <em>read</em> it and he still hadn't <em>seen</em> it
-</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The afternoon sunlight poured down into the office of the
Sunshine Regiment, illuminating General Granger in her chair as
though she glowed with a golden aura.</p>
<p>"How long do you think it will take Malfoy to figure it out?"
said General Granger.</p>
<p>"Not long," said Colonel Blaise Zabini. "He may have already.
How long will it take Potter to figure it out?"</p>
<p>"Forever," said General Granger, "unless Malfoy tells him, or
one of his own soldiers realizes. Harry Potter just doesn't think
like that."</p>
<p>"Really?" said Captain Ernie Macmillan, looking up from one of
the corner tables where he was being crushed at chess by Captain
Ron Weasley. (They'd brought back all the other chairs after Malfoy
had left, of course.) "I mean it seems kind of obvious to me. Who
would try to come up with all the ideas just by themselves?"</p>
<p>"Harry," said Hermione, at exactly the same time Zabini said,
"Malfoy."</p>
<p>"Malfoy thinks he's way better than everyone else," said
Zabini.</p>
<p>"And Harry... doesn't really <em>see</em> most other people like
that," said Hermione.</p>
<p>It was kind of sad, actually. Harry had grown up very, very
alone. It wasn't that he went around thinking in words that only
geniuses had a right to exist. It just wouldn't <em>occur</em> to
him that anyone in Hermione's army besides Hermione could have any
good ideas.</p>
<p>"Anyhow," Hermione said. "Captains Goldstein and Weasley, you're
on duty for thinking up strategic ideas for our next battle.
Captains Macmillan and Susan - sorry, I mean Macmillan and Bones -
try to come up with some tactics we can use, also any training you
think we should try. Oh, and congratulations on your marching song,
Captain Goldstein, I think it was a big plus for <em>esprit de
corps</em>."</p>
<p>"What're you doing?" said Susan. "And Colonel Zabini?"</p>
<p>Hermione stood up out of her chair, stretching. "I'll try to
figure out what Harry Potter is thinking and Colonel Zabini will
try to figure out what Draco Malfoy might do, and both of us will
join you again after we come up with something. I'm going to walk
while I think. Zabini, you want to come along?"</p>
<p>"Yes, General," said Zabini stiffly.</p>
<p>It hadn't been meant as an order. Hermione sighed to herself a
little. This was going to take some getting used to, and although
Zabini's first idea had certainly worked, she wasn't <em>quite</em>
sure that Professor Quirrell's quote mixture of positive and
negative incentives unquote would be enough to keep the Slytherin
fully on her side until December when traitors would be allowed for
the first time...</p>
<p>She still had no idea what she was going to do with Professor
Quirrell's Christmas wish, either. Maybe she'd just ask Mandy if
she wanted anything, when the time came around.</p>
</div>
<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 36: Status
Differentials<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>Wrenching disorientation, that was how it felt to walk out of
Platform Nine and Three-Quarters into the rest of Earth, the world
that Harry had once thought was the only real world. People dressed
in casual shirts and pants, instead of the more dignified robes of
wizards and witches. Scattered bits of trash here and there around
the benches. A forgotten smell, the fumes of burned gasoline, raw
and sharp in the air. The ambiance of the King's Cross train
station, less bright and cheerful than Hogwarts or Diagon Alley;
the people seemed smaller, more afraid, and likely would have
eagerly traded their problems for a dark wizard to fight. Harry
wanted to cast <em>Scourgify</em> for the dirt, and <em>Everto</em>
for the garbage, and if he'd known the spell, a Bubble-Head Charm
so he wouldn't have to breathe the air. But he couldn't use his
wand, in this place...</p>
<p>This, Harry realized, must be what it felt like to go from a
First World country to a Third World country.</p>
<p>Only it was the Zeroth World which Harry had left, the wizarding
world, of Cleansing Charms and house elves; where, between the
healer's arts and your own magic, you could hit one hundred and
seventy before old age really started catching up with you.</p>
<p>And nonmagical London, Muggle Earth, to which Harry had
temporarily returned. This was where Mum and Dad would live out the
rest of their lives, unless technology leapfrogged over wizardry's
quality of life, or something deeper in the world changed.</p>
<p>Without even thinking about it, Harry's head turned and his eyes
darted behind him to see the wooden trunk that was scurrying after
him, unnoticed by any Muggles, the clawed tentacles offering quick
confirmation that, yes, he hadn't just imagined it all...</p>
<p>And then there was the other reason for the tight feeling in his
chest.</p>
<p>His parents didn't know.</p>
<p>They didn't know <em>anything</em>.</p>
<p>They didn't know...</p>
<p>"Harry?" called a thin, blonde woman whose perfectly smooth and
unblemished skin made her look a good deal younger than
thirty-three; and Harry realized with a start that it <em>was</em>
magic, he hadn't known the signs before but he could see them now.
And whatever sort of potion lasted that long, it must have been
terribly dangerous, because most witches didn't do that to
themselves, they weren't that desperate...</p>
<p>There was water gathering in Harry's eyes.</p>
<p>"<em>Harry?</em> " yelled an older-looking man with a paunch
gathering about his stomach, dressed with ostentatious academic
carelessness in a black vest thrown over a dark grey-green shirt,
someone who would always be a professor anywhere he went, who would
certainly have been one of the most brilliant wizards of his
generation, if he'd been born with two copies of that gene, instead
of zero...</p>
<p>Harry raised his hand and waved to them. He couldn't speak. He
couldn't speak at all.</p>
<p>They came over to him, not running, but at a steady, dignified
walk; that was how fast Professor Michael Verres-Evans walked, and
Mrs. Petunia Evans-Verres wasn't about to walk any faster.</p>
<p>The smile on his father's face wasn't very wide, but then his
father never was given to huge smiles; it was, at least, as wide as
Harry had ever seen it, wider than when a new grant came in, or
when one of his students got a position, and you couldn't ask for a
wider smile than that.</p>
<p>Mum was blinking hard, and she was trying to smile but not doing
a very good job.</p>
<p>"So!" said his father as he came striding up. "Made any
revolutionary discoveries yet?"</p>
<p>Of course Dad thought he was joking.</p>
<p>It hadn't hurt quite so much when his parents didn't believe in
him, back when no one <em>else</em> had believed in him either,
back when Harry hadn't <em>known</em> how it felt to be taken
seriously by people like Headmaster Dumbledore and Professor
Quirrell.</p>
<p>And that was when Harry realized that the Boy-Who-Lived only
existed in magical Britain, that there wasn't any such person in
Muggle London, just a cute little eleven-year-old boy going home
for Christmas.</p>
<p>"Excuse me," Harry said, his voice trembling, "I'm going to
break down and cry now, it doesn't mean there was anything wrong at
school."</p>
<p>Harry started to move forward, and then stopped, torn between
hugging his father and hugging his mother, he didn't want either
one to feel slighted or that Harry loved them more than the other
-</p>
<p>"You," said his father, "are a very silly boy, Mr. Verres," and
he gently took Harry by the shoulders and pushed him into the arms
of his mother, who was kneeling down, tears already streaking her
cheek.</p>
<p>"Hello, Mum," Harry said with his voice wavering, "I'm back."
And he hugged her, amid the noisy mechanical sounds and the smell
of burned gasoline; and Harry started crying, because he knew that
nothing <em>could</em> go back, least of all him.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The sky was completely dark, and stars were coming out, by the
time they negotiated the Christmas traffic to the university town
that was Oxford, and parked in the driveway of the small,
dingy-looking old house that their family used to keep the rain off
their books.</p>
<p>As they walked up the brief stretch of pavement leading to the
front door, they passed a series of flower-pots holding small, dim
electric lights (dim since they had to recharge themselves off
solar power during the day), and the lights lit up just as they
passed. The hard part had been finding motion sensors that were
waterproof and triggered at just the right distance...</p>
<p>In Hogwarts there were real torches like that.</p>
<p>And then the front door opened and Harry stepped into their
living-room, blinking hard.</p>
<p><em>Every inch of wall space is covered by a bookcase. Each
bookcase has six shelves, going almost to the ceiling. Some
bookshelves are stacked to the brim with hardcover books: science,
math, history, and everything else. Other shelves have two layers
of paperback science fiction, with the back layer of books propped
up on old tissue boxes or two-by-fours, so that you can see the
back layer of books above the books in front. And it still isn't
enough. Books are overflowing onto the tables and the sofas and
making little heaps under the windows...</em></p>
<p>The Verres household was just as he'd left it, only with more
books, which was also just how he'd left it.</p>
<p>And a Christmas tree, naked and undecorated just two days before
Christmas Eve, which threw Harry briefly before he realized, with a
warm feeling blossoming in his chest, that of course his parents
had <em>waited</em>.</p>
<p>"We took the bed out of your room to make room for more
bookcases," said his father. "You can sleep in your trunk,
right?"</p>
<p>"<em>You</em> can sleep in my trunk," said Harry.</p>
<p>"That reminds me," said his father. "What <em>did</em> they end
up doing about your sleep cycle?"</p>
<p>"Magic," Harry said, making a beeline for the door that opened
upon his bedroom, just in case Dad <em>wasn't</em> joking...</p>
<p>"That's not an explanation!" said Professor Verres-Evans, just
as Harry shouted, "<em>You used up all the open space on my
bookcases?</em> "</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry had spent the 23rd of December shopping for Muggle things
that he couldn't just Transfigure; his father had been busy and had
said that Harry would need to walk or take the bus, which had
suited Harry just fine. Some of the people at the hardware store
had given Harry questioning looks, but he'd said with an innocent
voice that his father was shopping nearby and was very busy and had
sent him to get some things (holding up a list in carefully
adult-looking half-illegible handwriting); and in the end, money
was money.</p>
<p>They had all decorated the Christmas tree together, and Harry
had put a tiny dancing fairy on top (two Sickles, five Knuts at
Gambol &amp; Japes).</p>
<p>Gringotts had readily exchanged Galleons for paper money, but
they didn't seem to have any simple way to turn larger quantities
of gold into tax-free, unsuspicious Muggle money in a numbered
Swiss bank account. This had rather spiked Harry's plan to turn
most of the money he'd self-stolen into a sensible mix of 60%
international index funds and 40% Berkshire Hathaway. For the
moment, Harry had diversified his assets a little further by
sneaking out late at night, invisible and Time-Turned, and burying
one hundred golden Galleons in the backyard. He'd always always
<em>always</em> wanted to do that anyway.</p>
<p>Some of December 24th had been spent with the Professor reading
Harry's books and asking questions. Most of the experiments his
father had suggested were impractical, at least for the moment; of
those remaining, Harry had done many of them already. ("Yes, Dad, I
checked what happened if Hermione was given a changed pronunciation
and she didn't know whether it was changed, that was the very first
experiment I did, Dad!")</p>
<p>The last question Harry's father had asked, looking up from
<em>Magical Draughts and Potions</em> with an expression of
bewildered disgust, was whether it all made sense if you were a
wizard; and Harry had answered no.</p>
<p>Whereupon his father had declared that magic was
unscientific.</p>
<p>Harry was still a little shocked at the idea of pointing to a
section of <em>reality</em> and calling it unscientific. Dad seemed
to think that the conflict between his intuitions and the universe
meant that the universe had a problem.</p>
<p>(Then again, there were lots of physicists who thought that
quantum mechanics was weird, instead of quantum mechanics being
normal and them being weird.)</p>
<p>Harry had shown his mother the healer's kit he'd bought to keep
in their house, though most of the potions wouldn't work on Dad.
Mum had stared at the kit in a way that made Harry ask whether
Mum's sister had ever bought anything like that for Grandpa Edwin
and Grandma Elaine. And when Mum still hadn't answered, Harry had
said hastily that she must have just never thought of it. And then,
finally, he'd fled the room.</p>
<p>Lily Evans probably <em>hadn't</em> thought of it, that was the
sad thing. Harry knew that other people had a tendency to not-think
about painful subjects, in the same way they had a tendency not to
deliberately rest their hands on red-hot stove burners; and Harry
was starting to suspect that most Muggleborns rapidly acquired a
tendency to not-think about their family, who were all going to die
before they reached their first century anyway.</p>
<p>Not that Harry had any intention of letting <em>that</em>
happen, of course.</p>
<p>And then it was late in the day on December 24th and they were
driving off for their Christmas Eve dinner.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The house was huge, not by Hogwarts standards, but certainly by
the standards of what you could get if your father was a
distinguished professor trying to live in Oxford. Two stories of
brick gleaming in the setting sun, with windows on top of windows
and one tall window that went up much further than glass should go,
that was going to be one huge living room...</p>
<p>Harry took a deep breath, and rang the doorbell.</p>
<p>There was a distant call of "Honey, can you get it?"</p>
<p>This was followed by a slow patter of approaching steps.</p>
<p>And then the door opened to reveal a genial man, of fat and rosy
cheeks and thinning hair, in a blue button-down shirt straining
slightly at the seams.</p>
<p>"Dr. Granger?" Harry's father said briskly, before Harry could
even speak. "I'm Michael, and this is Petunia and our son Harry.
The food's in the magical trunk," and Dad made a vague gesture
behind him - not quite in the direction of the trunk, as it
happened.</p>
<p>"Yes, please, come in," said Leo Granger. He stepped forward and
took the wine bottle from the Professor's outstretched hands, with
a muttered "Thank you," and then stepped back and waved at the
living room. "Have a seat. And," his head turning down to address
Harry, "all the toys are downstairs in the basement, I'm sure Herm
will be down shortly, it's the first door on your right," and
pointed toward a hallway.</p>
<p>Harry just looked at him for a moment, conscious that he was
blocking his parents from coming in.</p>
<p>"Toys?" said Harry in a bright, high-pitched voice, with his
eyes wide. "I love toys!"</p>
<p>There was an intake of breath from his mother behind him, and
Harry strode into the house, managing not to stomp too hard as he
walked.</p>
<p>The living room was every bit as large as it had looked from
outside, with a huge vaulted ceiling dangling a gigantic
chandelier, and a Christmas tree that must have been murder to
maneuver through the door. The lower levels of the tree were
thoroughly and carefully decorated in neat patterns of red and
green and gold, with a newfound sprinkling of blue and bronze; the
heights that only a grownup could reach were carelessly, randomly
draped with strings of lights and wreaths of tinsel. A hallway
extended until it terminated in the cabinetry of a kitchen, and
wooden stairs with polished metal railings stretched up toward a
second floor.</p>
<p>"Gosh!" Harry said. "This is a big house! I hope I don't get
lost in here!"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Dr. Roberta Granger was feeling rather nervous as dinner
approached. The turkey and the roast, their own contributions to
the common project, were steadily cooking away in the oven; the
other dishes were to be brought by their guests, the Verres family,
who had adopted a boy named Harry. Who was known to the wizarding
world as the Boy-Who-Lived. And who was also the only boy that
Hermione had ever called "cute", or noticed at all, really.</p>
<p>The Verreses had said that Hermione was the only child in
Harry's age group whose existence their son had ever acknowledged
in any way whatsoever.</p>
<p>And it might've been jumping the gun just a little; but both
couples had a sneaking suspicion that wedding bells might be in the
offing a few years down the road.</p>
<p>So while Christmas Day would be spent, as always, with her
husband's family, they'd decided to spend Christmas Eve meeting
their daughter's possible future in-laws.</p>
<p>The doorbell rang while she was right in the middle of basting
the turkey, and she raised her voice and shouted, "<em>Honey, can
you get it?</em> "</p>
<p>There was a brief groan of a chair and its occupant, and then
there was the sound of her husband's heavy footsteps and the door
swinging open.</p>
<p>"Dr. Granger?" said an older man's brisk voice. "I'm Michael,
and this is Petunia and our son Harry. The food's in the magical
trunk."</p>
<p>"Yes, please, come in," said her husband, followed by a muttered
"Thank you" that indicated some sort of present had been accepted,
and "Have a seat." Then Leo's voice altered to a tone of artificial
enthusiasm, and said, "And all the toys are downstairs in the
basement, I'm sure Herm will be down shortly, it's the first door
on your right."</p>
<p>There was a brief pause.</p>
<p>Then a young boy's bright voice said, "Toys? I love toys!"</p>
<p>There was the sound of footsteps entering the house, and then
the same bright voice said, "Gosh! This is a big house! I hope I
don't get lost in here!"</p>
<p>Roberta closed up the oven, smiling. She'd been a bit worried
about the way Hermione's letters had described the Boy-Who-Lived -
though certainly her daughter hadn't said anything indicating that
Harry Potter was <em>dangerous;</em> nothing like the dark hints
written in the books Roberta had bought, supposedly for Hermione,
during their trip to Diagon Alley. Her daughter hadn't said much at
all, only that Harry talked like he came out of a book, and
Hermione was studying harder than she ever had in her life just to
stay ahead of him in class. But from the sound of it, Harry Potter
was an ordinary eleven-year-old boy.</p>
<p>She got to the front door just as her daughter came clattering
frantically down the stairs at a speed that didn't look safe at
all, Hermione had claimed that witches were more resistant to falls
but Roberta wasn't quite sure she believed that -</p>
<p>Roberta took in her first sight of Professor and Mrs. Verres,
who were both looking rather nervous, just as the boy with the
legendary scar on his forehead turned to her daughter and said, now
in a lower voice, "Well met on this fairest of evenings, Miss
Granger." His hand stretched back, as though offering his parents
on a silver platter. "I present to you my father, Professor Michael
Verres-Evans, and my mother, Mrs. Petunia Evans-Verres."</p>
<p>And as Roberta's mouth was gaping open, the boy turned back to
his parents and said, now in that bright voice again, "Mum, Dad,
this is Hermione! She's really smart!"</p>
<p>"<em>Harry!</em> " hissed her daughter. "Stop that!"</p>
<p>The boy swiveled again to regard Hermione. "I'm afraid, Miss
Granger," the boy said gravely, "that you and I have been exiled to
the labyrinthine recesses of the basement. Let us leave them to
their adult conversations, which would no doubt soar far above our
own childish intellects, and resume our ongoing discussion of the
implications of Humean projectivism for Transfiguration."</p>
<p>"Excuse us, please," said her daughter in a very firm tone, and
grabbed the boy by his left sleeve, and dragged him into the
hallway - Roberta swiveled helplessly to track them as they went
past her, the boy gave her a cheery wave - and then Hermione pulled
the boy into the basement access and slammed the door behind
her.</p>
<p>"I, ah, I apologize for..." said Mrs. Verres in a faltering
voice.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," said the Professor, smiling fondly, "Harry can be a
bit touchy about that sort of thing. But I expect he's right about
us not being interested in their conversation."</p>
<p><em>Is he dangerous?</em> Roberta wanted to ask, but she kept
her silence and tried to think of subtler questions. Her husband
beside her was chuckling, as if he'd found what they'd just seen
funny, rather than frightening.</p>
<p>The most terrible Dark Lord in history had tried to kill that
boy, and the burnt husk of his body had been found next to the
crib.</p>
<p>Her possible future son-in-law.</p>
<p>Roberta had been increasingly apprehensive about giving her
daughter over to witchcraft - especially after she'd read the
books, put the dates together, and realized that her magical mother
had probably been killed at the height of Grindelwald's terror,
<em>not</em> died giving birth to her as her father had always
claimed. But Professor McGonagall had made other visits after her
first trip, to "see how Miss Granger is doing"; and Roberta
couldn't help but think that if Hermione said her parents were
being troublesome about her witching career, something would be
done to <em>fix</em> them...</p>
<p>Roberta put her best smile on her face, and did what she could
to spread some pretended Christmas cheer.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The dining room table was much longer than six people - er, four
people and two children - really needed, but all of it was draped
with a tablecloth of fine white linen, and the dishes had been
needlessly transferred to fancy serving plates, which at least were
of stainless steel rather than real silver.</p>
<p>Harry was having a bit of trouble concentrating on the
turkey.</p>
<p>The conversation had turned to Hogwarts, naturally; and it'd
been obvious to Harry that his parents were hoping that Hermione
would trip up and say more about Harry's school life than Harry had
been telling them. And either Hermione had realized this, or she
was just automatically steering clear of anything that might prove
troublesome.</p>
<p>So <em>Harry</em> was fine.</p>
<p>But unfortunately Harry had made the mistake of owling his
parents with all sorts of facts about Hermione that she hadn't told
her <em>own</em> parents.</p>
<p>Like that she was general of an army in their after-school
activities.</p>
<p>Hermione's mother had looked very alarmed, and Harry had quickly
interrupted and done his best to explain that all the spells were
stunners, Professor Quirrell was always watching, and the existence
of magical healing meant that lots of things were much less
dangerous than they sounded, at which point Hermione had kicked him
hard under the table. Thankfully Harry's father, who Harry had to
admit was better than him at some things, had announced with firm
professorial authority that he hadn't worried at all, since he
couldn't imagine children being allowed to do it if it was
dangerous.</p>
<p>That wasn't why Harry was having trouble enjoying dinner,
though.</p>
<p>...the problem with feeling sorry for yourself was that it never
took any time at all to find someone else who had it worse.</p>
<p>Dr. Leo Granger had asked, at one point, whether that nice
teacher who'd seemed to like Hermione, Professor McGonagall, was
awarding her lots of points in school.</p>
<p>Hermione had said yes, with an apparently genuine smile.</p>
<p>Harry had managed, with some effort, to stop himself from icily
pointing out that Professor McGonagall would never show favoritism
to any Hogwarts student, and that Hermione was getting lots of
points because she'd earned <em>every, single, one.</em></p>
<p>At another point, Leo Granger had offered the table his opinion
that Hermione was very smart and could have gone to medical school
and become a dentist, if not for the whole witch business.</p>
<p>Hermione had smiled again, and a quick glance had prevented
Harry from suggesting Hermione might also have been an
<em>internationally famous scientist</em>, and asking whether that
thought would've occurred to the Grangers if they'd had a
<em>son</em> instead of a <em>daughter</em>, or if it was
unacceptable either way for their offspring to do better than
them.</p>
<p>But Harry was rapidly reaching his boiling point.</p>
<p>And becoming a <em>lot</em> more appreciative of the fact that
his own father had <em>always</em> done everything he could to
support Harry's development as a prodigy and <em>always</em>
encouraged him to reach higher and <em>never</em> belittled a
single one of his accomplishments, even if a child prodigy was
still just a child. Was this the sort of household he could have
ended up in, if Mum had married Vernon Dursley?</p>
<p>Harry was doing what he could, though.</p>
<p>"And she's really beating you in <em>all</em> your classes
except broomstick riding and Transfiguration?" said Professor
Michael Verres-Evans.</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said with forced calm, as he cut himself another
bite of Christmas Eve turkey. "By solid margins, in most of them."
There were other circumstances under which Harry would have been
more reluctant to admit that, which was why he hadn't gotten around
to telling his father until now.</p>
<p>"Hermione has always been quite good in school," said Dr. Leo
Granger in a satisfied tone.</p>
<p>"Harry competes at the national level!" said Professor Michael
Verres-Evans.</p>
<p>"Dear!" said Petunia.</p>
<p>Hermione was giggling, and that wasn't making Harry feel any
better about her situation. It didn't seem to bother Hermione and
<em>that bothered Harry.</em></p>
<p>"I'm not embarrassed to lose to her, Dad," Harry said. Right at
this moment he wasn't. "Did I mention that she memorized all her
schoolbooks before the first day of class? And yes, I tested
it."</p>
<p>"Is that, ah, <em>usual</em> for her?" Professor Verres-Evans
said to the Grangers.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, Hermione's always memorizing things," said Dr. Roberta
Granger with a cheerful smile. "She knows every recipe in all my
cookbooks by heart. I miss her every time I make dinner."</p>
<p>Judging by the look on his father's face, Dad was feeling at
least some of what Harry felt.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, Dad," Harry said, "she's getting all the advanced
material she can take, now. Her teachers at Hogwarts know she's
smart, <em>unlike her parents!</em> "</p>
<p>His voice had risen on the last three words, and even as all
faces turned to stare at him and Hermione kicked him again, Harry
knew that he'd blown it, but it was too much, just way too
much.</p>
<p>"Of course we know she's smart," said Leo Granger, starting to
look offended at the child who'd had the temerity to raise his
voice at their dinner table.</p>
<p>"You don't have the tiniest idea," said Harry, the ice now
leaking into his voice. "You think she reads a lot of books and
it's cute, right? You see a perfect report card and you think it's
good that she's doing well in class. Your daughter is the most
talented witch of her generation and the brightest star of
Hogwarts, and someday, Dr. and Dr. Granger, the fact that you were
her parents will be the only reason that history remembers
you!"</p>
<p>Hermione, who had calmly got up from her seat and walked around
the table, chose that moment to grab Harry's shirt by the shoulder
and pull him out of his chair. Harry let himself be pulled, but as
Hermione dragged him away, he said, raising his voice even louder,
"It is entirely possible that in a thousand years, the fact that
Hermione Granger's parents were dentists will be the only reason
anyone remembers dentistry!"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Roberta stared at where her daughter had just dragged the
Boy-Who-Lived out of the room with a patient look upon her young
face.</p>
<p>"I'm terribly sorry," said Professor Verres with an amused
smile. "But please don't worry, Harry always talks like that.
Aren't they just like a married couple already?"</p>
<p>The frightening thing was that they <em>were.</em></p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry had been expecting a rather severe lecture from
Hermione.</p>
<p>But after Hermione pulled them into the basement access and
closed the door behind them, she'd turned around -</p>
<p>- and was smiling, genuinely so far as Harry could tell.</p>
<p>"Please don't, Harry," she said in a soft voice. "Even though
it's very nice of you. Everything's fine."</p>
<p>Harry just looked at her. "How can you stand it?" he said. He
had to keep his voice quiet, they didn't want the parents to hear,
but it rose in pitch if not in volume. "<em>How can you stand
it?</em> "</p>
<p>Hermione shrugged, and said, "Because that's the way parents
<em>should</em> be?"</p>
<p>"No," Harry said, his voice low and intense, "it's not, my
father <em>never</em> puts me down - well, he <em>does</em>, but
never like that -"</p>
<p>Hermione held up a single finger, and Harry waited, watching her
search for words. It took her a while before she said, "Harry...
Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick like me because I'm the
most talented witch of my generation and the brightest star of
Hogwarts. And Mum and Dad don't know that, and you'll never be able
to tell them, but they love me anyway. Which means that everything
is just the way it should be, at Hogwarts and at home. And since
they're <em>my</em> parents, Mr. Potter, <em>you</em> don't get to
argue." She was once again smiling her mysterious smile from
dinnertime, and looking at Harry very fondly. "<em>Is</em> that
clear, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>Harry nodded tightly.</p>
<p>"Good," said Hermione, and leaned over and kissed him on the
cheek.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The conversation had only just gotten started again when a
distant high-pitched yelp floated back to them,</p>
<p>"<em>Hey! No kissing!</em> "</p>
<p>The two fathers burst out in laughter just as the two mothers
rose up from their chairs with identical looks of horror and dashed
toward the basement.</p>
<p>When the children had been brought back, Hermione was saying in
an icy tone that she was never going to kiss Harry ever again, and
Harry was saying in an outraged voice that the Sun would burn down
to a cold dead cinder before he let her get close enough to
try.</p>
<p>Which meant that everything was just the way it should be, and
they all sat back down again to finish their Christmas dinner.</p>
</div>
<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 37: Interlude: Crossing the
Boundary<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>It was almost midnight.</p>
<p>Staying up late was simple enough for Harry. He just hadn't used
the Time-Turner. Harry followed a tradition of timing his sleep
cycle to make sure he was awake for when Christmas Eve turned into
Christmas Day; because while he'd never been young enough to
<em>believe</em> in Santa Claus, he'd once been young enough to
doubt.</p>
<p>It would have been nice if there <em>had</em> been a mysterious
figure who entered your house in the night and brought you
presents...</p>
<p>A chill went down Harry's spine then.</p>
<p>An intimation of something dreadful approaching.</p>
<p>A creeping terror.</p>
<p>A sense of doom.</p>
<p>Harry sat bolt upright in bed.</p>
<p>He looked at the window.</p>
<p>"<em>Professor Quirrell?</em> " Harry shrieked very quietly.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell made a slight lifting gesture, and Harry's
window seemed to fold into its frame. At once a cold gust of winter
blew into the room through the gap, along with a scant few flakes
of snow from a sky spotted with grey night-clouds, amid the black
and stars.</p>
<p>"Fear not, Mr. Potter," said the Defense Professor in a normal
voice. "I have Charmed your parents asleep; they shall not wake
until I have departed."</p>
<p>"No one's supposed to know where I am!" said Harry, still
keeping the shriek quiet. "Even owls are supposed to deliver my
mail to Hogwarts, not here!" Harry had agreed to that willingly; it
would be silly if a Death Eater could win the whole war at any time
just by owling him a magically triggered hand grenade.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was grinning, from where he stood in the
backyard beyond the window. "Oh, I shouldn't worry, Mr. Potter. You
<em>are</em> well protected against locating Charms, and no blood
purist is likely to think of consulting a phone book." His grin
grew wider. "And it did take considerable effort to cross the wards
that the Headmaster put around this house - though of course anyone
who knew your address could simply wait outside and attack you the
next time you left."</p>
<p>Harry stared at Professor Quirrell for a while. "What are you
<em>doing</em> here?" Harry said finally.</p>
<p>The smile left Professor Quirrell's face. "I've come to
apologize, Mr. Potter," the Defense Professor said quietly. "I
should not have spoken to you so harshly as I -"</p>
<p>"Don't," Harry said. He looked down at the blanket that he was
clutching around his pajamas. "Just don't."</p>
<p>"Have I offended you that much?" said Professor Quirrell's quiet
voice.</p>
<p>"No," Harry said. "But you <em>will</em> if you apologize."</p>
<p>"I see," said Professor Quirrell, and in an instant his voice
grew stern. "Then if I am to treat you as an equal, Mr. Potter, I
should say that you have gravely violated the etiquette that holds
between friendly Slytherins. If you are not currently playing the
game against someone, you <em>must</em> not meddle in their plans
like that, not without asking them <em>before</em>. For you do not
know what their true design may be, nor what stakes they may lose.
It would mark you as their enemy, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," Harry said, in just the same quiet tone that
Professor Quirrell had used.</p>
<p>"Apology accepted," said Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>"But," Harry said, still quietly, "you and I really must speak
further on politics, at some point."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell sighed. "I know you dislike condescension,
Mr. Potter -"</p>
<p>That was a bit of an understatement.</p>
<p>"But it would be even more condescending," said Professor
Quirrell, "if I were not to state it clearly. You are missing some
life experience, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>"And does everyone who has sufficient life experience agree with
you, then?" said Harry calmly.</p>
<p>"What good is life experience to someone who plays Quidditch?"
said Professor Quirrell, and shrugged. "I think you will change
your mind in time, after every trust you place has failed you, and
you have become cynical."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor said it as though it were the most
ordinary statement in the world, framed against the black and the
stars and the cloud-spotted sky, as one or two tiny snowflakes blew
past him in the biting winter air.</p>
<p>"That reminds me," said Harry. "Merry Christmas."</p>
<p>"I suppose," said Professor Quirrell. "After all, if it is
<em>not</em> an apology, then it must be a Christmas gift. The very
first one I have ever given, in fact."</p>
<p>Harry hadn't even started yet on learning Latin so he could read
the experimental diary of Roger Bacon; and he hardly dared open his
mouth to ask.</p>
<p>"Put on your winter coat," said Professor Quirrell, "or take a
warming potion if you have one; and meet me outside, under the
stars. I shall see if I can maintain it a little longer this
time."</p>
<p>It took Harry a moment to process the words, and then he was
dashing for the coat closet.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell kept the spell of starlight going for more
than an hour, though the Defense Professor's face grew strained,
and he had to sit down after a while. Harry protested only once,
and was shushed.</p>
<p>They crossed the boundary from Christmas Eve to Christmas Day
within that timeless void where Earthly rotations meant nothing,
the one true everlasting Silent Night.</p>
<p>And just as promised, Harry's parents slept soundly all through
it, until Harry was safely back in his room, and the Defense
Professor had gone.</p>
</div>
<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 38: The Cardinal Sin<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>Bright the sun, bright the air, bright the students and bright
their parents, clean the paved ground of Platform 9.75, the winter
Sun hanging low in the sky at 9:45AM in the morning on January 5th,
1992. Some of the younger students wore scarves and mittens, but
most simply wore their robes; they were wizards, after all.</p>
<p>After Harry had moved away from the landing platform, he took
off his scarf and coat, opened a compartment of his trunk, and
stowed away his winter things.</p>
<p>For a long moment, he stood there letting the January air bite
at him, just to see what it was like.</p>
<p>Harry took out his wizards' robes, shrugged them on.</p>
<p>And finally, Harry drew his wand; and he couldn't help thinking
of the parents he'd only just kissed goodbye, of the world whose
problems he was leaving behind...</p>
<p>With a strange feeling of guilt for the unavoidable, Harry said,
"<em>Thermos.</em>"</p>
<p>The warmth flowed through him.</p>
<p>And the Boy-Who-Lived was back.</p>
<p>Harry yawned and stretched, feeling more lethargic than anything
else at the conclusion of his vacation. He didn't feel like reading
his textbooks, or even any serious science fiction, this morning;
what he needed was something completely frivolous to occupy his
attention...</p>
<p>Well, that wouldn't be hard to come by, if he was willing to
part with four Knuts.</p>
<p>Besides, if the <em>Daily Prophet</em> was corrupt and the
<em>Quibbler</em> was the only competing newspaper, there might be
some suppressed real news in there.</p>
<p>Harry trudged back over to the same newsstand from last time,
wondering if the <em>Quibbler</em> could top the headline he'd seen
before.</p>
<p>The vendor started to smile as Harry approached, and then the
man's face suddenly changed, as he caught sight of the scar.</p>
<p>"<em>Harry Potter?</em> " gasped the vendor.</p>
<p>"No, Mr. Durian," said Harry, eyes dipping briefly to the man's
nametag, "just an amazing imitation -"</p>
<p>And then Harry's voice stopped in his throat, as he caught sight
of the top fold of the <em>Quibbler.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>SLOSHED SEER SPILLS
SECRETS:<br>
DARK LORD TO RETURN,</em></p>
<p>For just an instant, Harry tried to clamp down on his face,
before realizing that <em>not</em> being shocked could be just as
revealing, in a sense -</p>
<p>"Excuse me," Harry said. His voice sounded a little alarmed, and
he didn't even know whether that was too revealing, or just what
his normal reaction <em>would</em> be if he didn't know anything.
He'd spent too much time around Slytherins, he was forgetting how
to keep secrets from ordinary people. Four Knuts hit the counter.
"One copy of the <em>Quibbler,</em> please."</p>
<p>"Oh, no worries, Mr. Potter!" said the vendor hastily, waving
his hands. "It's - never mind, just -"</p>
<p>A newspaper flew through the air and hit Harry's fingers, and he
unfolded it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>SLOSHED SEER SPILLS
SECRETS:<br>
DARK LORD TO RETURN,<br>
WED DRACO MALFOY</em></p>
<p>"It's free," said the vendor, "for <em>you</em>, I mean -"</p>
<p>"No," Harry said, "I was going to buy one anyway."</p>
<p>The vendor took the coins, and Harry read on.</p>
<p>"Gosh," Harry said half a minute later, "you get a seer smashed
on six slugs of Scotch and she spills all <em>sorts</em> of secret
stuff. I mean, who'd have thought that Sirius Black and Peter
Pettigrew were secretly the same person?"</p>
<p>"Not me," said the vendor.</p>
<p>"They've even got a picture of the two of them together, so we
know who it is that's secretly the same person."</p>
<p>"Yup," said the vendor. "Pretty clever disguise, innit?"</p>
<p>"And I'm secretly sixty-five years old."</p>
<p>"You don't look half that," the vendor said amiably.</p>
<p>"And I'm betrothed to Hermione Granger, <em>and</em> Bellatrix
Black, <em>and</em> Luna Lovegood, and oh yes, Draco Malfoy
too..."</p>
<p>"Goin' ter be one interesting wedding," said the vendor.</p>
<p>Harry looked up from the newspaper, and said in a pleasant
voice, "You know, I heard at first that Luna Lovegood was insane,
and I wondered if she really was, or if she was just making stuff
up and giggling to herself the whole time. Then when I read my
second <em>Quibbler</em> headline, I decided that she
<em>couldn't</em> be insane, I mean, it can't be <em>easy</em> to
make this stuff up, you couldn't do it by <em>accident</em>. And
<em>now</em> do you know what I think? I think she must be mad
after all. When ordinary people try to make stuff up, it doesn't
come out like <em>this</em>. Something's got to go really
<em>wrong</em> with the inside of your head before <em>this</em> is
what comes out when you start making stuff up!"</p>
<p>The vendor stared at Harry.</p>
<p>"Seriously," said Harry. "Who <em>reads</em> this stuff?"</p>
<p>"You," said the vendor.</p>
<p>Harry wandered off to read his newspaper.</p>
<p>He didn't sit at the same nearby table he'd sat down at with
Draco, the <em>first</em> time he'd prepared to board this train.
That seemed like tempting history to repeat itself.</p>
<p>It wasn't <em>just</em> that his first week at Hogwarts had
been, judging by the <em>Quibbler</em>, fifty-four years long. It
was that, in Harry's humble opinion, his life did not <em>need</em>
any new threads of complexity.</p>
<p>So Harry found a small iron chair somewhere else, distant from
the main crowd and the occasional muffled cracks of parents
Apparating in with their children, and sat down and read the
<em>Quibbler</em> to see if it contained any suppressed news.</p>
<p>And besides the obvious craziness (heaven help them all if any
of <em>that</em> was real) there was a good deal of snide romantic
gossip; but nothing that would really be all that
<em>important</em> if it was true.</p>
<p>Harry was just reading about the Ministry's proposed marriage
law, to ban all marriages, when -</p>
<p>"Harry Potter," said a silken voice that sent a shock of
adrenaline jolting through Harry's blood.</p>
<p>Harry looked up.</p>
<p>"Lucius Malfoy," Harry said, his voice weary. Next time he was
going to do the smart thing, and wait outside in the Muggle part of
King's Cross until 10:55am.</p>
<p>Lucius inclined his head courteously, sending his long white
hair drifting over his shoulders. The man was still carrying that
same cane, lacquered in black with a silver snake's head for its
handle; and something about his grip silently said <em>this is a
weapon of deadly power,</em> not <em>I am feeble and leaning on
this.</em> His face was expressionless.</p>
<p>Two men flanked him, their eyes continuously scanning, their
wands already gripped low in their hands. The two of them moved
like a single organism with four legs and four arms, the senior
Crabbe-and-Goyle, and Harry thought he could guess which was which,
but then it didn't really matter. They were merely Lucius's
appendages, as certainly as if they'd been the two rightmost toes
on his left foot.</p>
<p>"I apologize for disturbing you, Mr. Potter," said the smooth,
silken voice. "But you have answered none of my owls; and this, I
thought, might be my only opportunity to meet you."</p>
<p>"I have received none of your owls," Harry said calmly.
"Dumbledore intercepted them, I presume. But I would not have
answered them if I had, except through Draco. For me to deal with
you directly, without Draco's knowledge, would trespass on our
friendship."</p>
<p><em>Please go away, please go away...</em></p>
<p>The grey eyes glittered at him. "Is that your pose, then..."
said the senior Malfoy. "Well. I shall play along a little. What
was your purpose in maneuvering your good friend, my son, into a
public alliance with that girl?"</p>
<p>"Oh," Harry said lightly, "that's obvious, right? Draco's
working with Granger will make him realize that Muggleborns are
human after all. Bwa. Ha. Ha."</p>
<p>A thin trace of a smile moved over Lucius's lips. "Yes, that
does sound like one of Dumbledore's plans. Which it is
<em>not</em>."</p>
<p>"Indeed," said Harry. "It is part of my game with Draco, and no
work of Dumbledore's, and that is all I will say."</p>
<p>"Let us dispense with games," said the senior Malfoy, the grey
eyes suddenly hardening. "If my suspicions are true, you would
hardly do Dumbledore's bidding in any case, <em>Mr.
Potter.</em>"</p>
<p>There was a slight pause.</p>
<p>"So you know," Harry said, his voice cold. "Tell me. At which
point, exactly, did you realize?"</p>
<p>"When I read your response to Professor Quirrell's little
speech," said the white-haired man, and chuckled grimly. "I was
puzzled, at first, for it seemed not in your own interest; it took
me days to understand whose interest was being served, and then it
all finally became clear. And it is also obvious that you are weak,
in some ways if not others."</p>
<p>"Very clever of you," said Harry, still cold. "But perhaps you
mistake my interests."</p>
<p>"Perhaps I do." A hint of steel came into the silken voice.
"Indeed, that is precisely what I fear. You are playing strange
games with my son, to a purpose I cannot guess. That is not a
friendly act, and you cannot but <em>expect</em> me to be
concerned!"</p>
<p>Lucius was leaning upon his cane with both hands now, and both
those hands white, and his bodyguards had suddenly tensed.</p>
<p>Some instinct within Harry claimed that it would be a very bad
idea to show his fear, to let Lucius see that he could be
intimidated. They were in a public train station anyway -</p>
<p>"I find it interesting," Harry said, putting steel into his own
voice, "that you think I could benefit from doing Draco harm. But
it is irrelevant, Lucius. <em>He</em> is my friend, and I do not
betray my friends."</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " whispered Lucius. His face showed sheer
shock.</p>
<p>Then -</p>
<p>"Company," said one of the minions, and Harry thought, from the
voice, that it must be the senior Crabbe.</p>
<p>Lucius straightened and turned, then let out a hiss of
disapproval.</p>
<p>Neville was approaching, looking scared but determined, in tow
behind a tall woman who didn't look scared at all.</p>
<p>"Madam Longbottom," Lucius said icily.</p>
<p>"Mr. Malfoy," returned the woman with equal ice. "Are you being
an annoyance to our Harry Potter?"</p>
<p>The bark of laughter that came from Lucius seemed strangely
bitter. "Oh, I rather think not. Come to protect him from me, have
you?" The white-haired head shifted toward Neville. "And this would
be Mr. Potter's loyal lieutenant, the last scion of Longbottom,
Neville, self-styled of Chaos. How strangely does the world turn.
Sometimes I think it must all be mad."</p>
<p>Harry had no idea at all what to say to that, and Neville looked
confused, and frightened.</p>
<p>"I doubt it is the world that is mad," said Madam Longbottom.
Her voice took on a gloating tone. "You seem in a poor mood, Mr.
Malfoy. Did the speech of our dear Professor Quirrell cost you a
few allies?"</p>
<p>"It was a clever enough slander of my abilities," Lucius said
coldly, "though only effective upon the fools who believe that I
was truly a Death Eater."</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " blurted Neville.</p>
<p>"I was under the <em>Imperius,</em> young man," said Lucius, now
sounding tired. "The Dark Lord could hardly have begun recruiting
among pureblood families without the support of House Malfoy. I
demurred, and he simply made sure of me. His own Death Eaters did
not know it until afterward, hence the false Mark I bear; though
since I did not truly consent, it does not bind me. Some of the
Death Eaters still believe I was foremost among their number, and
for the peace of this nation I let them believe it, to keep them
controlled. But I was not such a fool as to support that ill-fated
adventurer of my own choice -"</p>
<p>"Ignore him," Madam Longbottom said, the instruction addressed
to Harry as well as Neville. "He must spend the rest of his life
pretending, for fear of your testimony under Veritaserum." Said
with malicious satisfaction.</p>
<p>Lucius turned his back on her dismissively, and faced Harry
again. "Will you request this harridan to depart, <em>Mr.
Potter?</em> "</p>
<p>"I think not," said Harry in a dry voice. "I prefer to deal with
the part of House Malfoy that's my own age."</p>
<p>There was a long pause, then. The grey eyes searched him.</p>
<p>"Of course..." said Lucius slowly. "I <em>do</em> feel the fool
now. This whole time you were just pretending to have no idea what
we were talking about."</p>
<p>Harry met the gaze, and said nothing.</p>
<p>Lucius raised his cane a few centimeters and struck it hard on
the ground.</p>
<p>The world vanished in a pale haze, all sounds went quiet, there
was nothing in the universe but Harry and Lucius Malfoy and the
snake-headed cane.</p>
<p>"My son is my heart," said the senior Malfoy, "the last
worthwhile thing I have left in this world, and this I say to you
in a spirit of friendship: if he were to come to harm, I would give
my life over to vengeance. But so long as my son does <em>not</em>
come to harm, I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors. And as
you have asked nothing more of me, I will ask nothing more of
you."</p>
<p>Then the pale haze vanished, showing an outraged Madam
Longbottom being blocked from moving forward by the senior Crabbe;
her wand was in her hand, now.</p>
<p>"How <em>dare</em> you!" she hissed.</p>
<p>Lucius's dark robes swirled around him, and his white hair, as
he turned to the senior Goyle. "We return to Malfoy Manor."</p>
<p>There were three pops of Apparition, and they were gone.</p>
<p>A silence followed.</p>
<p>"Dear <em>heavens</em>," said Madam Longbottom. "What was that
about?"</p>
<p>Harry shrugged helplessly. Then he looked at Neville.</p>
<p>There was sweat on Neville's forehead.</p>
<p>"Thank you very much, Neville," said Harry. "Your help was
greatly appreciated, Neville. And now, Neville, I think you should
sit down."</p>
<p>"Yes, General," said Neville, and instead of coming over to one
of the other chairs near Harry, he semi-collapsed into a sitting
position on the pavement.</p>
<p>"You have wrought many changes in my grandson," said Madam
Longbottom. "I approve of some, but not others."</p>
<p>"Send me the list of which is which," said Harry. "I'll see what
I can do."</p>
<p>Neville groaned, but said nothing.</p>
<p>Madam Longbottom gave a chuckle. "I shall, young man, thank
you." Her voice lowered. "Mr. Potter... the speech given by
Professor Quirrell is something our nation has long needed to hear.
I cannot say as much of your comment on it."</p>
<p>"I will take your opinion under advisement," Harry said
mildly.</p>
<p>"I dearly hope that you do," said Madam Longbottom, and turned
back to her grandson. "Do I still need to -"</p>
<p>"It's okay for you to go, Granma," said Neville. "I'll be fine
on my own, this time."</p>
<p>"Now <em>that</em> I approve of," she said, and popped and
vanished like a soap bubble.</p>
<p>The two boys sat quietly for a moment.</p>
<p>Neville spoke first, his voice weary. "You're going to try to
fix all the changes she <em>approves</em> of, right?"</p>
<p>"Not <em>all</em> of them," Harry said innocently. "I just want
to make sure I'm not corrupting you."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Draco looked <em>very</em> worried. His head kept darting
around, despite the fact that Draco had insisted on them going down
into Harry's trunk, and using a true Quieting Charm and not just
the sound-blurring barrier.</p>
<p>"<em>What</em> did you say to Father?" blurted Draco, the moment
the Quieting Charm went up and the sounds of Platform 9 3/4
vanished.</p>
<p>"I... look, can you tell me what he said to <em>you,</em> before
he dropped you off?" said Harry.</p>
<p>"That I should tell him right away if you seemed to be
threatening me," said Draco. "That I should tell him right away if
there was anything <em>I</em> was doing that could pose a threat to
<em>you!</em> Father thinks you're <em>dangerous,</em> Harry,
whatever you said to him today it <em>scared</em> him! <em>It's not
a good idea to scare Father!</em> "</p>
<p><em>Oh, hell...</em></p>
<p>"<em>What</em> did you talk about?" demanded Draco.</p>
<p>Harry leaned back wearily in the small folding chair that sat at
the bottom of his trunk's cavern. "You know, Draco, just as the
fundamental question of rationality is 'What do I think I know and
how do I think I know it?', there's also a cardinal sin, a way of
thinking that's the opposite of that. Like the ancient Greek
philosophers. They had no clue what was going on, so they'd go
around saying things like 'All is water' or 'All is fire', and they
never asked themselves, 'Wait a minute, even if everything
<em>is</em> water, how could I possibly <em>know</em> that?' They
didn't ask themselves if they had evidence which discriminated
<em>that</em> possibility from all the <em>other</em> possibilities
you could imagine, evidence they'd be very unlikely to encounter if
the theory <em>wasn't</em> true -"</p>
<p>"<em>Harry</em>," Draco said, his voice strained, "<em>What did
you talk about with Father?</em> "</p>
<p>"I don't know, actually," said Harry, "so it's very important
that I <em>not</em> just make stuff up -"</p>
<p>Harry had never heard Draco shriek in horror in quite that high
a pitch before.</p>
</div>
<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 35: Coordination Problems, Pt
3<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>They had gone to the Defense Professor's office, and Professor
Quirrell had sealed the door before he leaned back in his chair and
spoke.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor's voice was very calm, and that unnerved
Harry a good deal more than if Professor Quirrell had been
shouting.</p>
<p>"I am trying," said Professor Quirrell quietly, "to make
allowances for the fact that you are young. That I myself, at the
same age, was a quite extraordinary fool. You speak with adult
style and meddle in adult games, and sometimes I forget that you
are only a meddler. I hope, Mr. Potter, that your childish meddling
has not just killed you, ruined your country, and lost the next
war."</p>
<p>It was very hard for Harry to control his breathing. "Professor
Quirrell, I said a good deal less than I wished to say, but I had
to say something. Your proposals are extremely alarming to anyone
who has the slightest familiarity with Muggle history over the last
century. The Italian fascists, some very nasty people, got their
name from the <em>fasces,</em> a bundle of rods bound together to
symbolize the idea that unity is strength -"</p>
<p>"So the nasty Italian fascists believed that unity is stronger
than division," said Professor Quirrell. Sharpness was beginning to
creep into his voice. "Perhaps they also believed that the sky is
blue, and advocated a policy of not dropping rocks on your
head."</p>
<p><em>Reversed stupidity is not intelligence; the world's
stupidest person may say the sun is shining, but that doesn't make
it dark out...</em> "Fine, you're right, that was an ad hominem
argument, it's not wrong <em>because</em> the fascists said it. But
Professor Quirrell, you can't have everyone in a country take the
Mark of one dictator! It's a single point of failure! Look, I'll
put it this way. Suppose the enemy just Imperiuses whoever controls
the Mark -"</p>
<p>"Powerful wizards are not so easy to Imperius," said Professor
Quirrell dryly. "And if you cannot find a worthy leader, you are in
any case doomed. But worthy leaders do exist; the question is
whether the people shall follow them."</p>
<p>Harry raked his hands through his hair in frustration. He wanted
to call a time-out and make Professor Quirrell read <em>The Rise
and Fall of the Third Reich</em> and then start the conversation
over again. "I don't suppose that if I suggested democracy was a
better form of government than dictatorship -"</p>
<p>"I see," said Professor Quirrell. His eyes closed briefly, then
opened. "Mr. Potter, the stupidity of Quidditch is transparent to
you because you did not grow up revering the game. If you had never
heard of elections, Mr. Potter, and you simply <em>saw what is
there</em>, what you saw would not please you. Look to our elected
Minister of Magic. Is he the wisest, the strongest, the greatest of
our nation? No; he is a buffoon who is owned in fee simple by
Lucius Malfoy. Wizards went to the polls and chose between
Cornelius Fudge and Tania Leach, who had competed with each other
in a grand and entertaining contest after the <em>Daily
Prophet,</em> which Lucius Malfoy also controls, decided that they
were the only serious candidates. That Cornelius Fudge was
genuinely selected as the best leader our country could offer is
not a suggestion anyone could make with a straight face. It is no
different in the Muggle world, from what I have heard and seen; the
last Muggle newspaper I read mentioned that the previous President
of the United States had been a retired movie actor. If you had not
grown up with elections, Mr. Potter, they would be as transparently
silly to you as Quidditch."</p>
<p>Harry sat there with his mouth open, struggling for words. "The
point of elections isn't to produce the one best leader, it's to
keep politicians scared enough of the voters that they don't go
completely evil like dictators do -"</p>
<p>"The last war, Mr. Potter, was fought between the Dark Lord and
Dumbledore. And while Dumbledore was a flawed leader who was losing
the war, it is <em>ridiculous</em> to suggest that <em>any</em> of
the Ministers of Magic elected during that period could have taken
Dumbledore's place! Strength flows from powerful wizards and their
followers, not from elections and the fools they elect. That is the
lesson of magical Britain's recent history; and I doubt that the
next war will teach you a lesson any different. <em>If</em> you
survive it, Mr. Potter, which you will <em>not</em> do unless you
abandon the enthusiastic illusions of childhood!"</p>
<p>"If you think there are no dangers in the course of action you
advocate," said Harry, and despite everything his voice was growing
sharp, "then that, too, is childish enthusiasm."</p>
<p>Harry stared grimly into Professor Quirrell's eyes, who stared
back without blinking.</p>
<p>"Such dangers," said Professor Quirrell coldly, "are to be
discussed in offices like this one, not in speeches. The fools who
elected Cornelius Fudge are not interested in complications and
caution. Present them with anything more nuanced than a rousing
cheer, and you will face your war alone. <em>That</em>, Mr. Potter,
was your childish error, which Draco Malfoy would not have made
even when he was eight years old. It should have been obvious even
to <em>you</em> that you should have stayed silent, and
<em>consulted with me first</em>, not spoken your worries before
the crowd!"</p>
<p>"I am no friend of Albus Dumbledore," said Harry, a cold in his
voice to match Professor Quirrell's. "But he is no child, and he
did not seem to think my concerns were childish, nor that I should
have waited to speak them."</p>
<p>"Oh," said Professor Quirrell, "so you take your cues from the
Headmaster now, do you?" and stood up from behind his desk.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>When Blaise turned the corner on the way to the office, he saw
that Professor Quirrell was already leaning against the wall.</p>
<p>"Blaise Zabini," said the Defense Professor, straightening; his
eyes were set like dark stones within his face, and his voice sent
a shiver of fear down Blaise's spine.</p>
<p><em>He can't do anything against me, I just have to remember
that -</em></p>
<p>"I believe," said Professor Quirrell, in a clear, cold voice,
"that I have already guessed the name of your employer. But I would
hear it from your own lips, and tell me also the price that bought
you."</p>
<p>Blaise knew he was sweating under his robes, and that the
moisture would be already visible on his forehead. "I got a chance
to show I was better than all three generals, and I took it. A lot
of people hate me now, but there're also plenty of Slytherins
who'll love me for it. What makes you think I'm -"</p>
<p>"You did not devise the plan of today's battle, Mr. Zabini. Tell
me who did."</p>
<p>Blaise swallowed hard. "Well... I mean, in that case... then you
already know who did, right? The only one who's that crazy is
Dumbledore. And he'll protect me if you try to do anything."</p>
<p>"Indeed. Tell me the price." The Defense Professor's eyes were
still hard.</p>
<p>"It's my cousin Kimberly," Blaise said, swallowing again and
trying to control his voice. "She's real, and she's really being
bullied, Potter checked that, he wasn't dumb. Only Dumbledore said
that he'd nudged the bullies into doing it, just for the plan, and
if I worked for <em>him</em> she'd be fine afterward, but if I
<em>did</em> go with Potter, there was more trouble Kimberly could
get into!"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was silent for a long moment.</p>
<p>"I see," Professor Quirrell said, his voice now much milder.
"Mr. Zabini, should such an event occur again, you may contact me
directly. I have my own ways of protecting my friends. Now, a final
question: Even with all the power you took into your hands, forcing
a tie would have been difficult. Did Dumbledore instruct you as to
who should win otherwise?"</p>
<p>"Sunshine," said Blaise.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell nodded. "As I thought." The Defense Professor
sighed. "In your future career, Mr. Zabini, I do not suggest trying
any plots that complicated. They have a tendency to fail."</p>
<p>"Um, I said that to the Headmaster, actually," Blaise said, "and
he said that was why it was important to have more than one plot
going at a time."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell passed a weary hand across his forehead.
"It's a wonder the Dark Lord didn't go mad from fighting
<em>him.</em> You may go on to your meeting with the Headmaster,
Mr. Zabini. I will say nothing of this, but if the Headmaster
should somehow discover that we have spoken, remember my standing
offer to give you what protection I can. You are dismissed."</p>
<p>Blaise didn't wait for any other word, just turned and fled.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Professor Quirrell waited for a time, and then said, "Go ahead,
Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>Harry tore the Cloak of Invisibility off his head and stuffed
into his pouch. He was trembing with so much rage he could hardly
speak. "He <em>what?</em> He did <em>what?</em> "</p>
<p>"You should have deduced it yourself, Mr. Potter," Professor
Quirrell said mildly. "You must learn to blur your vision until you
can see the forest obscured by the trees. Anyone who heard the
stories about you, and who did not know that you were the
mysterious Boy-Who-Lived, could easily deduce your ownership of an
invisibility cloak. Step back from these events, blur away their
details, and what do we observe? There was a great rivalry between
students, and their competition ended in a perfect tie. That sort
of thing only happens in stories, Mr. Potter, and there is one
person in this school who thinks in stories. There was a strange
and complicated plot, which you should have realized was
uncharacteristic of the young Slytherin you faced. But there is a
person in this school who deals in plots that elaborate, and his
name is not Zabini. And I did warn you that there was a quadruple
agent; you knew that Zabini was at least a triple agent, and you
should have guessed a high chance that it was he. No, I will not
declare the battle invalid. All three of you failed the test, and
lost to your common enemy."</p>
<p>Harry didn't care about tests at this point. "Dumbledore
<em>blackmailed</em> Zabini by <em>threatening his cousin?</em>
Just to make our battle end in a tie? <em>Why?</em> "</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell gave a mirthless laugh. "Perhaps the
Headmaster thought the rivalry was good for his pet hero and wished
to see it continue. For the greater good, you understand. Or
perhaps he was simply mad. You see, Mr. Potter, everyone knows that
Dumbledore's madness is a mask, that he is sane pretending to be
insane. They pride themselves on that clever insight, and knowing
the secret explanation, they stop looking. It does not occur to
them that it is <em>also</em> possible to have a mask behind the
mask, to be insane pretending to be sane pretending to be insane.
And I am afraid, Mr. Potter, that I have urgent business elsewhere,
and must depart; but I should strongly advise you not to take your
cues from Albus Dumbledore when fighting a war. Until later, Mr.
Potter."</p>
<p>And the Defense Professor inclined his head with some irony, and
then strode off in the same direction Zabini had fled, while Harry
was still standing in open-mouthed shock.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Aftermath: Harry Potter.</em></p>
<p>Harry trudged slowly toward the Ravenclaw dorm, eyes unseeing of
walls, paintings, or other students; he went up stairs and down
ramps without slowing, speeding, or noticing where he trod.</p>
<p>It had taken him more than a minute after Professor Quirrell's
departure to realize that his only source of information about
Dumbledore being involved was (a) Blaise Zabini, who he would have
to be an absolute gaping idiot to trust again, and (b) Professor
Quirrell, who could have easily faked a plot in Dumbledore's style,
and who might also think that a little student rivalry was a fine
thing; and who had, if you stepped back and blurred out the
details, just proposed turning the country into a magical
dictatorship.</p>
<p>And it was also possible that Dumbledore <em>was</em> the one
behind Zabini, and that Professor Quirrell had been sincerely
trying to fight the Dark Mark in kind, and prevent the repetition
of a performance he saw as pathetic. Trying to make sure that Harry
didn't end up fighting the Dark Lord alone, while everyone else
hid, frightened, trying to stay out of the line of fire, waiting
for Harry to save them.</p>
<p>But the truth was...</p>
<p>Well...</p>
<p>Harry was sort of okay with that.</p>
<p>It was, he knew, the kind of thing that was supposed to make
heroes resentful and bitter.</p>
<p>To heck with that. Harry was very much in favor of everyone else
<em>staying out of danger</em> while the Boy-Who-Lived took down
the Dark Lord by himself, plus or minus a small number of
companions. If the next conflict with the Dark Lord got to the
point of a Second Wizarding War that killed lots of people and
embroiled a whole country, that would mean Harry had <em>already
failed</em>.</p>
<p>And if afterward a war broke out between wizards and Muggles, it
didn't matter who won, Harry would have already failed by letting
it get that far. Besides, who said the societies couldn't
peacefully integrate when the secrecy inevitably broke down?
(Though Harry could hear Professor Quirrell's dry voice in his
mind, asking him if he was a fool, and saying all the obvious
things...) And if mages and Muggles couldn't live in peace, then
Harry would combine magic and science and figure out how to
evacuate all the wizards to Mars or somewhere, instead of letting a
war break out.</p>
<p>Because if it did come down to a war of extermination...</p>
<p>That was the thing Professor Quirrell hadn't realized, the one
most important question he'd forgotten to ask his young
general.</p>
<p>The real reason why Harry had no intention of being argued into
endorsing a Light Mark, no matter <em>how</em> much it would help
him in his fight against the Dark Lord.</p>
<p>One Dark Lord and fifty Marked followers had been a peril to all
of magical Britain.</p>
<p>If all Britain took the Mark of a strong leader, they would be a
peril to the whole magical world.</p>
<p>And if the whole wizarding world took a single Mark, they would
be a danger to the rest of humanity.</p>
<p>No one knew quite how many wizards there were in the world. He'd
done a few estimates with Hermione and come up with numbers in the
rough range of a million.</p>
<p>But there were six billion Muggles.</p>
<p>If it came down to a final war...</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell had forgotten to ask Harry which side he
would protect.</p>
<p>A scientific civilization, reaching outward, looking upward,
knowing that its destiny was to grasp the stars.</p>
<p>And a magical civilization, slowly fading as knowledge was lost,
still governed by a nobility that saw Muggles as not quite
human.</p>
<p>It was a terribly sad feeling, but not one that held any hint of
doubt.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Aftermath: Blaise Zabini.</em></p>
<p>Blaise strolled through the hallways with careful, self-imposed
slowness, his heart beating wildly as he tried to calm down -</p>
<p>"Ahem," said a dry, whispering voice from a shadowy alcove as he
passed.</p>
<p>Blaise jumped, but he didn't scream.</p>
<p>Slowly, he turned.</p>
<p>In that small, shadowy corner was a black cloak so wide and
billowing that it was impossible to determine whether the figure
beneath was male or female, and atop the cloak a broad-brimmed
black hat, and a black mist seemed to gather beneath it and obscure
the face of whoever or whatever might lie beneath.</p>
<p>"Report," whispered Mr. Hat and Cloak.</p>
<p>"I said just what you told me to," said Blaise. His voice was a
little calmer now that he wasn't lying to anyone. "And Professor
Quirrell reacted just the way you expected."</p>
<p>The broad black hat tilted and straightened, as though the head
below had nodded. "Excellent," said the unidentifiable whisper.
"The reward I promised you is already on its way to your mother, by
owl."</p>
<p>Blaise hesitated, but his curiosity was eating him alive. "Can I
ask now why you want to cause trouble between Professor Quirrell
and Dumbledore?" The Headmaster hadn't had anything to do with the
Gryffindor bullies that Blaise knew about, and besides helping
Kimberly, the Headmaster had also offered to make Professor Binns
give him excellent marks in History of Magic even if he turned in
blank parchments for his homework, though he'd still have to attend
class and pretend to hand them in. Actually Blaise would have
betrayed all three generals for free, and never mind his cousin
either, but he'd seen no need to say that.</p>
<p>The broad black hat cocked to one side, as if to convey a
quizzical stare. "Tell me, friend Blaise, did it occur to you that
traitors who betray so many times over often meet with ill
ends?"</p>
<p>"Nope," said Blaise, looking straight into the black mist under
the hat. "Everyone knows that nothing <em>really</em> bad ever
happens to students in Hogwarts."</p>
<p>Mr. Hat and Cloak gave a whispery chuckle. "Indeed," said the
whisper. "With the murder of one student five decades ago being the
exception that proves the rule, since Salazar Slytherin would have
keyed his monster into the ancient wards at a higher level than the
Headmaster himself."</p>
<p>Blaise stared at the black mist, now beginning to feel a little
uneasy. But it ought to take a Hogwarts professor to do anything
significant to him without setting off alarms. Quirrell and Snape
were the only professors who'd do something like this, and Quirrell
wouldn't care about fooling <em>himself</em>, and Snape wouldn't
hurt one of his own Slytherins... would he?</p>
<p>"No, friend Blaise," whispered the black mist, "I only wished to
advise you never to try anything like this in your adult life. So
many betrayals would certainly lead to at least one vengeance."</p>
<p>"My <em>mother</em> never got any vengeances," said Blaise
proudly. "Even though she married <em>seven</em> husbands and every
single one of them died mysteriously and left her lots of
money."</p>
<p>"Really?" said the whisper. "However did she persuade the
seventh to marry her after he heard what happened to the first
six?"</p>
<p>"I asked Mum that," said Blaise, "and she said I couldn't know
until I was old enough, and I asked her how old was old enough, and
she said, older than her."</p>
<p>Again the whispery chuckle. "Well then, friend Blaise, my
congratulations on having followed in your mother's footsteps. Go,
and if you say nothing of this, we will not meet again."</p>
<p>Blaise backed uneasily away, feeling an odd reluctance to turn
his back.</p>
<p>The hat tilted. "Oh, come now, little Slytherin. If you were
truly the equal of Harry Potter or Draco Malfoy, you would have
already realized that my hinted threats were just to ensure your
silence before Albus. Had I intended to harm, I would not have
hinted; had I said nothing, <em>then</em> you should have
worried."</p>
<p>Blaise straightened, feeling a little insulted, and nodded to
Mr. Hat and Cloak; then turned decisively and strode off toward his
meeting with the Headmaster.</p>
<p>He'd been hoping to the very end that someone <em>else</em>
would show up and give him a chance to sell out Mr. Hat and
Cloak.</p>
<p>But then Mum hadn't betrayed seven different husbands at the
<em>same time.</em> When you looked at it <em>that</em> way, he was
still doing better than her.</p>
<p>And Blaise Zabini went on walking toward the Headmaster's
office, smiling, content to be a quintuple agent -</p>
<p>For a moment the boy stumbled, but then straightened, shaking
off the odd feeling of disorientation.</p>
<p>And Blaise Zabini went on walking toward the Headmaster's
office, smiling, content to be a quadruple agent.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Aftermath: Hermione Granger.</em></p>
<p>The messenger didn't approach her until she was alone.</p>
<p>Hermione was just leaving the girl's bathroom where she
sometimes hid to think, and a bright shining cat leaped out of
nowhere and said, "Miss Granger?"</p>
<p>She let out a little shriek before she realized the cat had
spoken in Professor McGonagall's voice.</p>
<p>Even so she hadn't been frightened, only startled; the cat was
bright and brilliant and beautiful, glowing with a white silver
radiance like moon-colored sunlight, and she couldn't imagine being
scared.</p>
<p>"What are you?" said Hermione.</p>
<p>"This is a message from Professor McGonagall," said the cat,
still in the Professor's voice. "Can you come to my office, and not
speak of this to anyone?"</p>
<p>"I'll be there right away," said Hermione, still surprised, and
the cat leaped and vanished; only it didn't vanish, it traveled
away somehow; or that was what her mind said, even though her eyes
just saw it disappear.</p>
<p>By the time Hermione had got to the office of her favorite
professor, her mind was all a-whirl with speculations. Was there
something wrong with her Transfiguration scores? But then why would
Professor McGonagall say not to tell anyone? It was probably about
Harry practicing his partial Transfiguration...</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall's face looked worried, not stern, as
Hermione seated herself in front of the desk - trying to keep her
eyes from going to the nest of cubbyholes containing Professor
McGonagall's homework, she'd always wondered what sort of work
grownups had to do to keep the school running and whether they
could use any help from her...</p>
<p>"Miss Granger," said Professor McGonagall, "let me start by
saying that I already know about the Headmaster asking you to make
that wish -"</p>
<p>"He <em>told</em> you?" blurted Hermione in startlement. The
Headmaster had said no one else was supposed to know!</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall paused, looked at Hermione, and gave a sad
little chuckle. "It's good to see Mr. Potter hasn't corrupted you
too much. Miss Granger, you aren't supposed to <em>admit</em>
anything just because I say I know. As it happens, the Headmaster
did <em>not</em> tell me, I simply know him too well."</p>
<p>Hermione was blushing furiously now.</p>
<p>"It's fine, Miss Granger!" said Professor McGonagall hastily.
"You're a Ravenclaw in your first year, nobody expects you to be a
Slytherin."</p>
<p>That <em>really</em> stung.</p>
<p>"Fine," said Hermione with some acerbity, "I'll go ask Harry
Potter for Slytherin lessons, then."</p>
<p>"That <em>wasn't</em> what I wanted to..." said Professor
McGonagall, and her voice trailed off. "Miss Granger, I'm worried
about this <em>because</em> young Ravenclaw girls shouldn't have to
be Slytherins! If the Headmaster asks you to get involved in
something you're not comfortable with, Miss Granger, it really is
all right to say no. And if you're feeling pressured, please tell
the Headmaster that you would like me to be there, or that you
would like to ask me first."</p>
<p>Hermione's eyes were very wide. "Does the Headmaster do things
that are wrong?"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall looked a little sad at that. "Not on
purpose, Miss Granger, but I think... well, it probably <em>is</em>
true that sometimes the Headmaster has trouble remembering what
it's like to be a child. Even when he was a child, I'm sure he must
have been brilliant, and strong of mind and heart, with courage
enough for three Gryffindors. Sometimes the Headmaster asks too
much of his young students, Miss Granger, or isn't careful enough
not to hurt them. He is a good man, but sometimes his plotting can
go too far."</p>
<p>"But it's <em>good</em> for students to be strong and have
courage," said Hermione. "That's why you suggested Gryffindor for
me, wasn't it?"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall smiled wryly. "Perhaps I was only being
selfish, wanting you for my own House. Did the Sorting Hat offer
you - no, I should not have asked."</p>
<p>"It told me I might go anywhere but Slytherin," said Hermione.
She'd <em>almost</em> asked why she wasn't good enough for
Slytherin, before she'd managed to stop herself... "So I
<em>have</em> courage, Professor!"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall leaned forward over her desk. The worry was
showing plainer on her face now. "Miss Granger, it's not about
courage, it's about what's healthy for young girls! The Headmaster
is drawing you into his plots, Harry Potter is giving you his
secrets to keep, and now you're making alliances with Draco Malfoy!
And I promised your mother that you would be safe at Hogwarts!"</p>
<p>Hermione just didn't know what to say to that. But the thought
was occurring to her that Professor McGonagall might not have been
warning her if she'd been a boy in Gryffindor instead of a girl in
Ravenclaw and <em>that</em> was, well... "I'll try to be good," she
said, "and I won't let anyone tell me otherwise."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall pressed her hands over her eyes. When she
took them away, her lined face looked very old. "Yes," she said in
a whisper, "you would have done well in my House. Stay safe, Miss
Granger, and be careful. And if you are ever worried or
uncomfortable about anything, please come to me at once. I won't
keep you any longer."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Aftermath, Draco Malfoy:</em></p>
<p>Neither of them really wanted to do anything complicated that
Saturday, not after fighting a battle earlier. So Draco was just
sitting in an unused classroom and trying to read a book called
<em>Thinking Physics.</em> It was one of the most fascinating
things that Draco had ever read in his life, at least the parts he
could understand, at least when the <em>accursed idiot</em> who
refused to let his books out of his sight could manage to <em>shut
up</em> and let Draco <em>concentrate</em> -</p>
<p>"Hermione Granger is a <em>muuudbloood,</em>" sang Harry Potter
from where he sat at a nearby desk, reading a far more advanced
book of his own.</p>
<p>"I know what you're trying to do," said Draco calmly without
looking up from the pages. "It's not going to work. We're still
ganging up and crushing you."</p>
<p>"A <em>Maaaalfoy</em> is working with a <em>muuudbloood,</em>
what will all your father's <em>frieeeends</em> think -"</p>
<p>"They'll think Malfoys aren't as easily manipulated as
<em>you</em> seem to believe, <em>Potter!</em> "</p>
<p>The Defense Professor was crazier than Dumbledore, no future
saviour of the world could ever be this <em>childish</em> and
<em>undignified</em> at any age.</p>
<p>"Hey, Draco, you know what's really going to suck? <em>You</em>
know that Hermione Granger has two copies of the magical allele,
just like you and just like me, but all your classmates in
Slytherin don't know that and <em>yooouuu're</em> not allowed to
<em>explaaaaain</em> -"</p>
<p>Draco's fingers were whitening where they gripped the book.
Being beaten and spat upon couldn't possibly require this much
self-control, and if he didn't get back at Harry soon, he was going
to do something incriminating -</p>
<p>"So what <em>did</em> you wish the first time?" said Draco.</p>
<p>Harry didn't say anything, so Draco looked up from his book, and
felt a twinge of malicious satisfaction at the sad look on Harry's
face.</p>
<p>"Um," Harry said. "A lot of people asked me that, but I don't
think Professor Quirrell would have wanted me to talk about
it."</p>
<p>Draco put a serious look on his own face. "You can talk about it
with <em>me</em>. It's probably not important compared to the other
secrets you've told me, and what else are friends for?" <em>That's
right, I'm your friend! Feel guilty!</em></p>
<p>"It wasn't really all that interesting," Harry said with
obviously artificial lightness. "Just, <em>I wish Professor
Quirrell would teach Battle Magic again next year.</em>"</p>
<p>Harry sighed, and looked back down at his book.</p>
<p>And said, after another few seconds, "Your father's probably
going to be pretty upset with you this Christmas, but if you
promise him that you'll betray the mudblood girl and wipe out her
army, everything will go back to being all right, and you'll still
get your Christmas presents."</p>
<p>Maybe if he and Granger asked Professor Quirrell extra politely
and used some of their Quirrell points, the two of them would be
allowed to do something more interesting to General Chaos than
putting him to sleep.</p>
</div>
<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 40: Pretending to be Wise, Pt
2<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>Harry, holding the tea cup in the exactly correct way that
Professor Quirrell had needed to demonstrate three times, took a
small, careful sip. All the way across the long, wide table that
was the centerpiece of Mary's Room, Professor Quirrell took a sip
from his own cup, making it look far more natural and elegant. The
tea itself was something whose name Harry couldn't even pronounce,
or at least, every time Harry had tried to repeat the Chinese
words, Professor Quirrell had corrected him, until finally Harry
had given up.</p>
<p>Harry had maneuvered himself into getting a glimpse at the bill
last time, and Professor Quirrell had let him get away with it.</p>
<p>He'd felt an impulse to drink a Comed-Tea first.</p>
<p><em>Even taking that into account</em>, Harry had still been
shocked out of his skin.</p>
<p>And it still tasted to him like, well, tea.</p>
<p>There was a quiet, nagging suspicion in Harry's mind that
Professor Quirrell <em>knew</em> this, and was deliberately buying
ridiculously expensive tea that Harry couldn't appreciate <em>just
to mess with him.</em> Professor Quirrell <em>himself</em> might
not like it all that much. Maybe <em>nobody</em> actually liked
this tea, and the only point of it was to be ridiculously expensive
and make the victim feel unappreciative. In fact, maybe it was
really just ordinary tea, only you asked for it in a certain code,
and they put a fake gigantic price on the bill...</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's expression was drawn and thoughtful. "No,"
Professor Quirrell said, "you should <em>not</em> have told the
Headmaster about your conversation with Lord Malfoy. Please try to
think faster next time, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Professor Quirrell," Harry said meekly. "I still
don't see it." There were times when Harry felt very much like an
impostor, pretending to be cunning in Professor Quirrell's
presence.</p>
<p>"Lord Malfoy is Albus Dumbledore's opponent," said Professor
Quirrell. "At least for this present time. All Britain is their
chessboard, all wizards their pieces. Consider: Lord Malfoy
threatened to throw away everything, abandon his game, to take
vengeance on you if Mr. Malfoy was hurt. In which case, Mr.
Potter...?"</p>
<p>It took more long seconds for Harry to get it, but it was clear
that Professor Quirrell wasn't going to give any more hints, not
that Harry wanted them.</p>
<p>Then Harry's mind finally made the connection, and he frowned.
"Dumbledore kills Draco, makes it look like <em>I</em> did it, and
Lucius sacrifices his game against Dumbledore to get at me? That...
doesn't seem like the Headmaster's <em>style,</em> Professor
Quirrell..." Harry's mind flashed back to a similar warning from
Draco, which had made Harry say the same thing.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell shrugged, and sipped his tea.</p>
<p>Harry sipped his own tea, and sat in silence. The tablecloth
spread over the table was in a very peaceful pattern, seeming at
first like plain cloth, but if you stared at it long enough, or
kept silent long enough, you started to see a faint tracery of
flowers glimmering on it; the curtains of the room had changed
their pattern to match, and seemed to shimmer as though in a silent
breeze. Professor Quirrell was in a contemplative mood that
Saturday, and so was Harry, and Mary's Room, it seemed, had not
neglected to notice this.</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell," Harry said suddenly, "is there an
afterlife?"</p>
<p>Harry had chosen the question carefully. Not, <em>do you believe
in an afterlife?</em> but simply <em>Is there an afterlife?</em>
What people <em>really</em> believed didn't seem to them like
<em>beliefs</em> at all. People didn't say, 'I strongly believe in
the sky being blue!' They just said, 'the sky is blue'. Your true
inner map of the world just felt to you like the way the world
<em>was...</em></p>
<p>The Defense Professor raised his cup to his lips again before
answering. His face was thoughtful. "If there is, Mr. Potter," said
Professor Quirrell, "then quite a few wizards have wasted a great
deal of effort in their searches for immortality."</p>
<p>"That's not actually an answer," Harry observed. He'd learned by
now to notice that sort of thing when talking to Professor
Quirrell.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell set down his teacup with a small,
high-pitched tacking sound on his saucer. "Some of those wizards
were reasonably intelligent, Mr. Potter, so you may take it that
the existence of an afterlife is not obvious. I have looked into
the matter myself. There have been many claims of the sort which
hope and fear would be expected to produce. Among those reports
whose veracity is not in doubt, there is nothing which could not be
the result of mere wizardry. There are certain devices said to
communicate with the dead, but these, I suspect, only project an
image from the mind; the result seems indistinguishable from memory
because it <em>is</em> memory. The alleged spirits tell no secrets
they knew in life, nor could have learned after death, which are
not known to the wielder -"</p>
<p>"Which is why the Resurrection Stone is not the most valuable
magical artifact in the world," said Harry.</p>
<p>"Precisely," said Professor Quirrell, "though I wouldn't say no
to a chance to try it." There was a dry, thin smile on his lips;
and something colder, more distant, in his eyes. "You spoke to
Dumbledore of that as well, I take it."</p>
<p>Harry nodded.</p>
<p>The curtains were taking on a faintly blue pattern, and a dim
tracery of elaborate snowflakes now seemed to be becoming visible
on the tablecloth. Professor Quirrell's voice sounded very calm.
"The Headmaster can be very persuasive, Mr. Potter. I hope he has
not persuaded you."</p>
<p>"<em>Heck</em> no," said Harry. "Didn't fool me for a
second."</p>
<p>"I should hope not," said Professor Quirrell, still in that very
calm tone. "I would be extremely put out to discover that the
Headmaster had convinced you to throw away your life on some fool
plot by telling you that death is the next great adventure."</p>
<p>"I don't think the Headmaster believed it himself, actually,"
Harry said. He sipped his own tea again. "He asked me what I could
possibly do with eternity, gave me the usual line about it being
boring, and he didn't seem to see any conflict between that and his
own claim to have an immortal soul. In fact, he gave me a whole
long lecture about how awful it was to want immortality before he
claimed to have an immortal soul. I can't quite visualize what must
have been going on inside his head, but I don't think he
<em>actually</em> had a mental model of himself continuing forever
in the afterlife..."</p>
<p>The temperature of the room seemed to be dropping.</p>
<p>"You perceive," said a voice like ice from the other end of the
table, "that Dumbledore does not truly believe as he speaks. It is
not that he has compromised his principles. It is that he never had
them from the beginning. Are you becoming cynical yet, Mr.
Potter?"</p>
<p>Harry had dropped his eyes to his teacup. "A little," Harry said
to his possibly-ultra-high-quality, perhaps-ridiculously-expensive
Chinese tea. "I'm certainly becoming a bit <em>frustrated</em>
with... whatever's going wrong in people's heads."</p>
<p>"Yes," said that icy voice. "I find it frustrating as well."</p>
<p>"Is there any way to get people <em>not</em> to do that?" said
Harry to his teacup.</p>
<p>"There is indeed a certain useful spell which solves the
problem."</p>
<p>Harry looked up hopefully at that, and saw a cold, cold smile on
the Defense Professor's face.</p>
<p>Then Harry got it. "I mean, <em>besides</em> Avada Kedavra."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor laughed. Harry didn't.</p>
<p>"Anyway," Harry said hastily, "I <em>did</em> think fast enough
not to suggest the obvious idea about the Resurrection Stone in
front of Dumbledore. Have you ever seen a stone with a line, inside
a circle, inside a triangle?"</p>
<p>The deathly chill seemed to draw back, fold into itself, as the
ordinary Professor Quirrell returned. "Not that I can recall,"
Professor Quirrell said after a while, a thoughtful frown on his
face. "That is the Resurrection Stone?"</p>
<p>Harry set aside his teacup, then drew on his saucer the symbol
he had seen on the inside of his cloak. And before Harry could take
out his own wand to cast the Hover Charm, the saucer went floating
obligingly across the table toward Professor Quirrell. Harry really
wanted to learn that wandless stuff, but that, apparently, was far
above his current curriculum.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell studied Harry's tea-saucer for a moment, then
shook his head; and a moment later, the saucer went floating back
to Harry.</p>
<p>Harry put his teacup back on the saucer, noting absently as he
did so that the symbol he'd drawn had vanished. "If you happen to
see a stone with that symbol," said Harry, "and it <em>does</em>
talk to the afterlife, do let me know. I have a few questions for
Merlin or anyone who was around in Atlantis."</p>
<p>"Quite," said Professor Quirrell. Then the Defense Professor
lifted up his teacup again, and tipped it back as though to finish
the last of what was there. "By the way, Mr. Potter, I fear we
shall have to cut short today's visit to Diagon Alley. I was hoping
it would - but never mind. Let it stand that there is something
else I must do this afternoon."</p>
<p>Harry nodded, and finished his own tea, then rose from his seat
at the same time as Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>"One last question," Harry said, as Professor Quirrell's coat
lifted itself off the coatrack and went floating toward the Defense
Professor. "Magic is loose in the world, and I no longer trust my
guesses so much as I once did. So in your own best guess and
without any wishful thinking, do <em>you</em> believe there's an
afterlife?"</p>
<p>"If I did, Mr. Potter," said Professor Quirrell as he shrugged
on his coat, "would I still be <em>here?</em> "</p>
</div>
<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 41: Frontal Override<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>The biting January wind howled around the vast, blank stone
walls that demarcated the material bounds of the castle Hogwarts,
whispering and whistling in odd pitches as it blew past closed
windows and stone turrets. The most recent snow had mostly blown
away, but occasional patches of melted and refrozen ice still stuck
to the stone face and blazed reflected sunlight. From a distance,
it must have looked like Hogwarts was blinking hundreds of
eyes.</p>
<p>A sudden gust made Draco flinch, and try, impossibly, to press
his body even closer to the stone, which felt like ice and smelled
like ice. Some utterly pointless instinct seemed convinced that he
was about to be blown off the outer wall of Hogwarts, and that the
best way to prevent this was to jerk around in helpless reflex and
possibly throw up.</p>
<p>Draco was trying very hard <em>not</em> to think about the six
stories worth of empty air underneath him, and focus, instead, on
how he was going to kill Harry Potter.</p>
<p>"You know, Mr. Malfoy," said the young girl beside him in a
conversational voice, "if a seer had told me that someday I'd be
hanging onto the side of a castle by my fingertips, trying not to
look down or think about how loud Mum'd scream if she saw me, I
wouldn't've had <em>any</em> idea of how it'd happen,
<em>except</em> that it'd be Harry Potter's fault."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Earlier:</em></p>
<p>The two allied Generals stepped together over Longbottom's body,
their boots hitting the floor in almost perfect synchrony.</p>
<p>Only a single soldier now stood between them and Harry, a
Slytherin boy named Samuel Clamons, whose hand was clenched white
around his wand, held upward to sustain his Prismatic Wall. The
boy's breathing was coming rapidly, but his face showed the same
cold determination that lit the eyes of his general, Harry Potter,
who was standing behind the Prismatic Wall at the dead end of the
corridor next to an open window, with his hands held mysteriously
behind his back.</p>
<p>The battle had been ridiculously difficult, for the enemy being
outnumbered two-to-one. It should have been easy, Dragon Army and
the Sunshine Regiment had melded together easily in practice
sessions, they'd fought each other long enough to know each other
very well indeed. Morale was high, both armies knowing that this
time they weren't just fighting to win for themselves, but fighting
for a world free of traitors. Despite the surprised protests of
both generals, the soldiers of the combined army had insisted on
calling themselves Dramione's Sungon Argiment, and produced patches
for their insignia of a smiling face wreathed in flames.</p>
<p>But Harry's soldiers had all blackened their own insignia - it
didn't look like paint, more like they'd <em>burned</em> that part
of their uniforms - and they'd fought all through the upper levels
of Hogwarts with a desperate fury. The cold rage that Draco
sometimes saw in Harry had seemed to trickle down into his
soldiers, and they'd fought like it hadn't been play. And Harry had
emptied out his entire bag of tricks, there'd been tiny metal balls
(Granger had identified them as "ball bearings") on floors and
staircases, rendering them impassable until cleared, only Harry's
army had already practiced coordinated Hover Charms and they could
fly their own people <em>right over</em> the obstacles they'd
made...</p>
<p>You couldn't bring devices into the game from outside, but you
could Transfigure anything you wanted <em>during</em> the game, so
long as it was safe. And that just wasn't fair when you were
fighting a boy raised by scientists, who knew about things like
ball bearings and skateboards and bungee cords.</p>
<p>And so it had come to this.</p>
<p>The survivors of the allied forces had cornered the last
remnants of Harry Potter's army in a dead-end corridor.</p>
<p>Weasley and Vincent had rushed Longbottom at the same time,
moving together like they'd practiced for weeks instead of hours,
and somehow Longbottom had managed to hex them <em>both</em> before
falling himself.</p>
<p>And now it was Draco and Granger and Padma and Samuel and Harry,
and by the looks of Samuel, his Prismatic Wall couldn't last much
longer.</p>
<p>Draco had already leveled his wand at Harry, waiting for the
Prismatic Wall to fall of its own accord; there was no need to
waste a Breaking Drill Hex before then. Padma leveled her own wand
at Samuel, Granger leveled hers at Harry...</p>
<p>Harry was still hiding his hands behind his back, instead of
aiming his wand; and looking at them with a face that could have
been carved out of ice.</p>
<p>It might be a bluff. It probably wasn't.</p>
<p>There was a brief, tense silence.</p>
<p>And then Harry spoke.</p>
<p>"I'm the villain now," the young boy said coldly, "and if you
think villains are this easy to finish off, you'd better think
again. Beat me when I'm fighting seriously, and I'll stay beaten;
but lose, and we'll be doing this all over again next time."</p>
<p>The boy brought his hands forward, and Draco saw that Harry was
wearing strange gloves, with a peculiar grayish material on the
fingertips, and buckles that stapped the gloves tightly to his
wrists.</p>
<p>Beside Draco, the Sunshine General gasped in horror; and Draco,
without even asking why, fired a Breaking Drill Hex.</p>
<p>Samuel staggered, he let out a scream as he staggered, but he
held the Wall; and if Padma or Granger fired now, they would
exhaust their own forces so badly that they might just lose.</p>
<p>"<em>Harry!</em> " shouted Granger. "<em>You can't be
serious!</em> "</p>
<p>Harry was already in motion.</p>
<p>And as he swung out the open window, his cold voice said,
"Follow if you dare."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The icy wind howled around them.</p>
<p>Draco's arms were already starting to feel tired.</p>
<p>...It had developed that, yesterday, Harry had carefully
demonstrated to Granger exactly how to Transfigure the gloves he
was currently wearing, which used something called 'gecko setae';
and how to glue Transfigured patches of the same material to the
toes of their shoes; and Harry and Granger had, in innocent
childish play, tried climbing around the walls and ceiling a
little.</p>
<p>And that, also yesterday, Harry had supplied Granger with a
grand total of exactly two doses of Feather-Falling Potion to carry
around in her pouch, "just in case".</p>
<p>Not that Padma would have followed them, anyway. <em>She</em>
wasn't crazy.</p>
<p>Draco carefully peeled loose his right hand, stretched it over
as far as he could, and slapped it down on the stone again. Beside
him, Granger did the same.</p>
<p>They'd already swallowed the Feather-Falling Potion. It was
skirting the edges of the game rules, but the potion wouldn't be
activated unless one of them actually fell, and so long as they
<em>didn't</em> fall they weren't using the item.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was watching them.</p>
<p>The two of them were <em>perfectly, completely, utterly
safe.</em></p>
<p>Harry Potter, on the other hand, was going to die.</p>
<p>"I wonder why Harry is doing this," said General Granger in a
reflective tone, as she slowly peeled the fingertips of one hand
off the wall with an extended sticky sound. Her hand plopped back
down again almost as soon as it was lifted. "I'll have to ask him
that after I kill him."</p>
<p>It was amazing how much the two of them were turning out to have
in common.</p>
<p>Draco didn't really feel like talking right now, but he managed
to say, through gritted teeth, "Could be revenge. For the
date."</p>
<p>"Really," said Granger. "After all this time."</p>
<p>Stick. Plop.</p>
<p>"How sweet of him," said Granger.</p>
<p>Stick. Plop.</p>
<p>"I guess I'll find some truly romantic way to thank him," said
Granger.</p>
<p>Stick. Plop.</p>
<p>"What's he got against <em>you?</em> " said Granger.</p>
<p>Stick. Plop.</p>
<p>The icy wind howled around them.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>One might have thought it would feel safer to have ground under
your feet again.</p>
<p>But if that ground was a slanted roof tiled with rough slats,
which had rather a lot more ice on it than the stone walls, and you
were running across it at a high rate of speed...</p>
<p>Then you would be <em>sadly mistaken.</em></p>
<p>"<em>Luminos!</em> " shouted Draco.</p>
<p>"<em>Luminos!</em> " shouted Granger.</p>
<p>"<em>Luminos!</em> " shouted Draco.</p>
<p>"<em>Luminos!</em> " shouted Granger.</p>
<p>The distant figure was dodging and scrambling as it ran, and not
a single shot hit, but they were gaining.</p>
<p>Until Granger slipped.</p>
<p>It was inevitable, in retrospect, in real life you couldn't
<em>actually</em> run across icy slanted rooftops at a high rate of
speed.</p>
<p>And also inevitably, because it happened without the slightest
thought, Draco spun and grabbed for Granger's right arm, and he
<em>caught</em> her, only she was already too far off balance, she
was falling and pulling Draco with her, it all happened so quickly
-</p>
<p>There was a hard, painful impact, not just Draco's weight
hitting the rooftop but some of Granger's weight too, and if she'd
hit just a little bit closer to the edge they could have made it,
but instead her body tipped again and her legs slipped off and her
other hand grabbed frantically...</p>
<p>And that was how Draco ended up holding onto Granger's arm in a
white grip, while her other hand clenched frantically at the edge
of the rooftop and the toes of Draco's shoes dug into the edge of a
roof tile.</p>
<p>"<em>Hermione!</em> " Harry's voice shrieked distantly.</p>
<p>"Draco," whispered Granger's voice, and Draco looked down.</p>
<p>That might have been a mistake. There was a lot of air
underneath her, nothing but air, they were on the edge of a rooftop
that had jutted out from the main stone wall of Hogwarts.</p>
<p>"He's going to come help me," whispered the girl, "but first
he's going to <em>Luminos</em> both of us, there's no way he
wouldn't. You have to let me go."</p>
<p>It should have been the easiest thing in the world.</p>
<p>She was just a mudblood, just a mudblood, <em>just a
mudblood!</em></p>
<p>She wouldn't even be <em>hurt!</em></p>
<p>...Draco's brain wasn't listening to anything Draco was telling
it right now.</p>
<p>"Do it," Hermione Granger whispered, her eyes blazing without a
single trace of fear, "do it, Draco, do it, you can beat him
yourself <em>we have to win Draco!</em> "</p>
<p>There was a sound of someone running and it was coming
closer.</p>
<p><em>Oh, be rational...</em></p>
<p>The voice in Draco's head sounded an awful lot like Harry Potter
teaching lessons.</p>
<p>...<em>are you going to let your brain run your life?</em></p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Aftermath, 1:</em></p>
<p>It was taking a bit of an effort for Daphne Greengrass to keep
herself quiet, as Millicent Bulstrode retold the story in the
Slytherin girls' common room (a cozy cool place in the dungeons
running beneath the Hogwarts Lake, with fish swimming past every
window, and couches you could lie down in if you wanted). Mostly
because, in Daphne's opinion, it was a perfectly good story already
without all of Millicent's <em>improvements</em>.</p>
<p>"And then what?" gasped Flora and Hestia Carrow.</p>
<p>"General Granger looked up at him," Millicent said dramatically,
"and she said, 'Draco! You've got to let go of me! Don't worry
about me, Draco, I promise I'll be all right! And what do you
suppose Malfoy did then?"</p>
<p>"He said 'Never!'," shouted Charlotte Wiland, "and held on even
tighter!"</p>
<p>All the listening girls except Pansy Parkinson nodded.</p>
<p>"Nope!" said Millicent. "He dropped her. And then he jumped up
and shot General Potter. The end."</p>
<p>There was a stunned pause.</p>
<p>"You can't <em>do</em> that!" said Charlotte.</p>
<p>"She's a <em>mudblood,</em>" said Pansy, sounding confused. "Of
<em>course</em> he let go!"</p>
<p>"Well, Malfoy shouldn't have grabbed her in the first place,
then!" said Charlotte. "But once he grabbed her, he <em>had</em> to
hang on! <em>Especially</em> in the face of approaching certain
doom!" Tracey Davis, sitting next to Daphne, was nodding along in
firm agreement.</p>
<p>"I don't see why," said Pansy.</p>
<p>"That's because you don't have the tiniest smidgin of romance in
you," said Tracey. "Besides, you can't just go dropping girls. A
boy who'd drop a girl like that... he'd drop <em>anyone.</em> He'd
drop <em>you,</em> Pansy."</p>
<p>"What d'you mean, <em>drop me?</em> " Pansy said.</p>
<p>Daphne couldn't resist any more. "You know," Daphne said darkly,
"you're eating breakfast one day at our table, and the next thing
you know, Malfoy <em>lets go of you,</em> and you're falling off
the top of Hogwarts! That's what!"</p>
<p>"Yeah!" said Charlotte. "He's a witch dropper!"</p>
<p>"You know why Atlantis fell?" said Tracey. "'Cause someone like
Malfoy <em>dropped</em> it, that's why!"</p>
<p>Daphne lowered her voice. "In fact... what if Malfoy's the one
who made Hermione, I mean General Granger, slip in the first place?
What if he's out to make <em>all</em> the Muggleborns trip and
fall?"</p>
<p>"You mean - ?" gasped Tracey.</p>
<p>"That's right!" Daphne said dramatically. "What if Malfoy is -
<em>the heir of Slipperin?</em> "</p>
<p>"The next Drop Lord!" said Tracey.</p>
<p>Which was far too good a line for anyone to keep to themselves,
so by nightfall it was all over Hogwarts, and the next morning it
was the <em>Quibbler's</em> headline.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Aftermath, 2:</em></p>
<p>Hermione made sure she got to their usual classroom nice and
early that evening, just so that she would be by herself, in a
chair, peacefully reading a book, when Harry got there.</p>
<p>If there was any way for a door to creak open apologetically,
that was how the door was creaking open.</p>
<p>"Um," said Harry Potter's voice.</p>
<p>Hermione kept reading.</p>
<p>"I'm, um, kinda sorry, I didn't mean for you to
<em>actually</em> fall off the roof or anything..."</p>
<p>It had been quite an entertaining experience, in fact.</p>
<p>"I, ah... I don't have much experience apologizing, I'll fall to
my knees if you want, or buy you something expensive, <em>Hermione
I don't know how to apologize to you for this what can I do just
tell me?</em> "</p>
<p>She kept reading the book in silence.</p>
<p>It wasn't as if <em>she</em> had any idea how Harry could
apologize, either.</p>
<p>Right now she was just feeling a sort of odd curiosity as to
what would happen if she kept reading her book for a while.</p>
</div>
<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 42: Courage<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>"<em>Romantic?</em> " Hermione said. "They're both
<em>boys!</em> "</p>
<p>"Wow," Daphne said, sounding a little shocked. "You mean Muggles
really <em>do</em> hate that? I thought that was just something the
Death Eaters made up."</p>
<p>"No," said an older Slytherin girl Hermione didn't recognize,
"it's true, they have to get married in secret, and if they're ever
discovered, they get burned at the stake together. And if you're a
girl who thinks it's romantic, they burn you too."</p>
<p>"That can't be right!" objected a Gryffindor girl, while
Hermione was still trying to sort out what to say to that. "There
wouldn't be any Muggle girls <em>left!</em> "</p>
<p>She'd kept on reading quietly, and Harry Potter had kept on
trying to apologize, and it had soon dawned on Hermione that Harry
had realized, possibly for the first time in his life, that he'd
done something annoying; and that Harry, definitely for the first
time in his life, was <em>terrified</em> that he'd lost her as a
friend; and she'd started to feel (a) guilty and (b) worried about
the direction Harry's increasingly desperate offers were going. But
she still had no idea what sort of apology was appropriate, so
she'd said that the Ravenclaw girls should vote on it - and this
time she wouldn't fix the outcome, though she hadn't mentioned that
part - to which Harry had instantly agreed.</p>
<p>The next day, practically every Ravenclaw girl over the age of
thirteen had voted to have Draco drop Harry.</p>
<p>Hermione had felt mildly disappointed it was that simple, though
it was obviously fair.</p>
<p>Right now, however, standing just outside the great doors of the
castle amid half the female population of Hogwarts, Hermione was
beginning to suspect that there were <em>things</em> going on here
that she did not understand and that she desperately hoped neither
of her fellow generals ever heard about.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>You couldn't really see the details from up there, just the
general fact of a sea of expectant female faces.</p>
<p>"You've got no idea what this is about, do you?" said Draco,
sounding amused.</p>
<p>Harry had read a fair number of books he wasn't supposed to
read, not to mention a few <em>Quibbler</em> headlines.</p>
<p>"Boy-Who-Lived gets Draco Malfoy pregnant?" said Harry.</p>
<p>"Okay, you <em>do</em> know what this is about," said Draco. "I
thought Muggles hated that?"</p>
<p>"Only the dumb ones," said Harry. "But, um, aren't we, uh, a
little <em>young?</em> "</p>
<p>"Not too young for <em>them,</em>" said Draco. He snorted.
"<em>Girls!</em> "</p>
<p>They silently walked toward the edge of the roof.</p>
<p>"So <em>I'm</em> doing this for revenge on you," said Draco,
"but why are <em>you</em> doing this?"</p>
<p>Harry's mind made a lightning calculation, weighing the factors,
whether it was too soon...</p>
<p>"Honestly?" said Harry. "Because I meant to have her climb up
the icy walls, but I <em>didn't</em> mean to have her fall off the
roof. And, um, I kinda <em>did</em> feel really awful about that. I
mean, I guess I actually did start seeing her as my friendly rival
after a while. So this is a real apology to her, not a plot or
anything."</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>Then -</p>
<p>"Yeah," said Draco. "I understand."</p>
<p>Harry didn't smile. It might have been the most difficult
nonsmile of his life.</p>
<p>Draco looked at the edge of the roof, and made a face. "This is
going to be a lot harder to do on purpose than by accident, isn't
it."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry's other hand held the roof in a reflexively terrified
grip, his fingers white on the cold, cold stone.</p>
<p>You could know with your conscious mind that you'd drunk the
Feather-Falling Potion. Knowing it with your unconscious mind was
another matter entirely.</p>
<p>It was every bit as scary as Harry had thought it might have
been for Hermione, which was justice.</p>
<p>"Draco," said Harry, controlling his voice wasn't easy, but the
Ravenclaw girls had given them a script, "You've got to let me
go!"</p>
<p>"Okay!" said Draco, and let go of Harry's arm.</p>
<p>Harry's other hand scrabbled at the edge, and then, without any
decision being made, his fingers failed, and Harry fell.</p>
<p>There was a brief moment when Harry's stomach tried to leap up
into his throat, and his body tried desperately to orient itself in
the absence of any possible way to do so.</p>
<p>There was a brief moment when Harry could feel the
Feather-Falling Potion kicking in, starting to slow him, a sort of
lurching, cushioning feeling.</p>
<p>And then something <em>pulled</em> on Harry and he accelerated
downward again <em>faster than gravity -</em></p>
<p>Harry's mouth had already opened and begun screaming while part
of his brain tried to think of something creative he could do, part
of his brain tried to calculate how much time he had left to be
creative, and a tiny rump part of his brain noticed that he wasn't
even going to finish the remaining-time calculation before he hit
the ground -</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry was desperately trying to control his hyperventilating,
and it wasn't helping him to hear the shrieking of all the girls,
now lying in heaps on the ground and each other.</p>
<p>"Good heavens," said the unfamiliar man, he of the old-looking
clothes and faintly scarred face, who was holding Harry in his
arms. "Of all the ways I imagined we might meet again someday, I
didn't expect it to be you falling out of the sky."</p>
<p>Harry remembered the last thing he'd seen, the falling body, and
managed to gasp, "Professor... Quirrell..."</p>
<p>"He'll be all right after a few hours," said the unfamiliar man
holding Harry. "He's just exhausted. I wouldn't have thought it
possible... he must have knocked down <em>two hundred students</em>
just to make sure he got whoever was jinxing you..."</p>
<p>Gently, the man set Harry upright on the ground, supporting him
the while.</p>
<p>Harry carefully balanced himself, and nodded to the man.</p>
<p>He let go, and Harry promptly fell over.</p>
<p>The man helped him rise again. Making sure, at all times, to
stand between Harry and the girls now picking themselves up from
the ground, his head constantly glancing in that direction.</p>
<p>"Harry," the man said quietly, and very seriously, "do you have
any idea which of these girls might have wanted to kill you?"</p>
<p>"Not murder," said a strained voice. "Just stupidity."</p>
<p>This time it was the unfamiliar man who seemed to almost fall
over, utter shock on his face.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was already sitting up from where he'd fallen
on the grass.</p>
<p>"Good heavens!" gasped the man. "You shouldn't be -"</p>
<p>"Mr. Lupin, your concerns are misplaced. No wizard, no matter
how powerful, casts such a Charm by strength alone. You must do it
by being <em>efficient.</em>"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell didn't stand up, though.</p>
<p>"Thank you," Harry whispered. And then, "Thank you," to the man
standing beside him as well.</p>
<p>"What happened?" said the man.</p>
<p>"I should have foreseen it myself," Professor Quirrell said, his
voice crisp with disapproval. "Some number of girls tried to summon
Mr. Potter to their own, particular arms. Individually, I suppose,
they all thought they were being gentle."</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>"Consider it a lesson in preparedness, Mr. Potter," said
Professor Quirrell. "Had I not <em>insisted</em> that there be more
than one adult witness to this little event, and that <em>both</em>
of us have our wands out, Mr. Lupin would not have been available
to slow your fall afterward, and you would have been gravely
injured."</p>
<p>"<em>Sir!</em> " said the man - Mr. Lupin, apparently. "You
should not say such things to the boy!"</p>
<p>"Who is -" Harry started to say.</p>
<p>"The only other person who was available to watch, besides
myself," said Professor Quirrell. "I introduce you to Remus Lupin,
who is here temporarily to instruct students in the Patronus Charm.
Though I am told that the two of you have already met."</p>
<p>Harry studied the man, puzzled. He should have remembered that
faintly scarred face, that strange, gentle smile.</p>
<p>"Where did we meet?" said Harry.</p>
<p>"In Godric's Hollow," said the man. "I changed a number of your
nappies."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Mr. Lupin's temporary office was a small stone room with a small
wooden desk, and Harry couldn't see anything of what Mr. Lupin was
sitting on, suggesting that it was a small stool just like the one
in front of his desk. Harry guessed that Mr. Lupin wouldn't be at
Hogwarts for long, or use this office much, and so he'd told the
house elves not to waste the effort. It said something about a
person that he tried not to bother house elves. Specifically, it
said that he'd been Sorted into Hufflepuff, since, to the best of
Harry's knowledge, Hermione was the only non-Hufflepuff who worried
about bothering house elves. (Harry himself thought her qualms
rather silly. Whoever had created house elves in the first place
had been unspeakably evil, obviously; but that didn't mean Hermione
was doing the right thing <em>now</em> by denying sentient beings
the drudgery they had been shaped to enjoy.)</p>
<p>"Please sit down, Harry," the man said quietly. His formal robes
were of low quality, not quite tattered, but visibly worn by the
passage of time in a way that simple Repair Charms couldn't fix;
<em>shabby</em> was the word that came to mind. And despite that,
somehow, there was a dignity about him that couldn't have been
obtained by fine and expensive robes, that wouldn't have
<em>fit</em> with fine robes, that was the exclusive property of
the shabby. Harry had <em>heard</em> of humility, but he'd never
seen the real thing before - only the satisfied modesty of people
who thought it was part of their style and wanted you to
notice.</p>
<p>Harry took a seat on the small wooden stool in front of Mr.
Lupin's short desk.</p>
<p>"Thank you for coming," the man said.</p>
<p>"No, thank <em>you</em> for saving me," said Harry. "Let me know
if you ever need something impossible done."</p>
<p>The man seemed to hesitate. "Harry, may I... ask a personal
question?"</p>
<p>"You can ask, certainly," Harry said. "I have a lot of questions
for you, too."</p>
<p>Mr. Lupin nodded. "Harry, are your stepparents treating you
well?"</p>
<p>"My <em>parents</em>," Harry said. "I have four. Michael, James,
Petunia, and Lily."</p>
<p>"Ah," said Mr. Lupin. And then, "Ah" again. He seemed to be
blinking rather hard. "I... that is good to hear, Harry, Dumbledore
would tell none of us where you were... I was afraid he might think
you ought to have wicked stepparents, or some such... "</p>
<p>Harry wasn't sure Mr. Lupin's concern had been misplaced,
considering his own first encounter with Dumbledore; but it had all
turned out well enough, so he said nothing. "What about my..."
Harry searched for a word that didn't raise them higher or put them
lower... "<em>other</em> parents? I want to know, well,
everything."</p>
<p>"A tall order," Mr. Lupin said. He wiped a hand across his
forehead. "Well, let us begin at the beginning. When you were born,
James was so happy that he couldn't touch his wand without it
glowing gold, for a whole week. And even after that, whenever he
held you, or saw Lily holding you, or just thought of you, it would
happen again -"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Every now and then Harry would look at his watch, and find that
another thirty minutes had passed. He felt slightly bad about
making Remus miss dinner, especially since Harry himself would just
drop back to 7pm later, but that wasn't enough to stop either of
them.</p>
<p>Finally Harry screwed up enough courage to ask the critical
question, while Remus was in the middle of an extended discourse on
the wonders of James's Quidditch that Harry couldn't find the heart
to squash more directly.</p>
<p>"And that was when," Remus said, his eyes shining brightly,
"James pulled off a <em>triple reverse Mulhanney Dive</em> with
<em>extra backspin!</em> The whole crowd went wild, even some of
the Hufflepuffs were cheering -"</p>
<p><em>I guess you had to be there,</em> Harry thought - not that
being there would have helped in any way - and said, "Mr.
Lupin?"</p>
<p>Something about Harry's voice must have reached the man, because
he stopped in mid-sentence.</p>
<p>"Was my father a bully?" said Harry.</p>
<p>Remus looked at Harry for a long moment. "For a little while,"
Remus said. "He grew out of it soon enough. Where did you hear
that?"</p>
<p>Harry didn't answer, he was trying to think of something true to
say that would deflect suspicion, but he didn't think fast
enough.</p>
<p>"Never mind," said Remus, and sighed. "I can guess who." The
faintly scarred face was pinched in disapproval. "What a thing to
tell -"</p>
<p>"Did my father have any extenuating circumstances?" Harry said.
"Poor home life, or something like that? Or was he just... being
naturally nasty?" <em>Cold?</em></p>
<p>Remus's hand swept his hair back, the first nervous gesture
Harry had seen from him. "Harry," Remus said, "you can't judge your
father by what he did as a young boy!"</p>
<p>"<em>I'm</em> a young boy," Harry said, "and I judge
<em>myself.</em>"</p>
<p>Remus blinked twice at that.</p>
<p>"I want to know <em>why</em>," Harry said. "I want to
<em>understand</em>, because to me, it seems like there isn't any
possible excuse for that!" Voice shaking a bit. "Please tell me
anything you know about why he did it, even if it doesn't sound
nice." <em>So I don't fall into the same trap myself, whatever it
is.</em></p>
<p>"It was the thing to do if you were in Gryffindor," Remus said,
slowly, reluctantly. "And... I didn't think so back then, I thought
it was the other way around, but... it might have been
<em>Black</em> who got <em>James</em> into it, really... Black
wanted so much to show everyone that he was against Slytherin, you
see, we all wanted to believe that blood wasn't destiny -"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"No, Harry," said Remus. "I don't know why Black went after
Peter instead of running. It was as though Black was making tragedy
for the sake of tragedy that day." The man's voice was unsteady.
"There was no hint, no warning, we all thought - to think that he
was to be -" Remus's voice cut off.</p>
<p>Harry was crying, he couldn't help it, it hurt worse to hear it
from Remus than anything he'd ever felt himself. Harry had lost two
parents he didn't remember, knew only from stories. Remus Lupin had
lost all four of his best friends in less than twenty-four hours;
and for the loss of his last remaining one, Peter Pettigrew,
there'd just been no reason at all.</p>
<p>"Sometimes it still hurts to think of him in Azkaban," Remus
finished, his voice almost a whisper. "I am glad, Harry, that Death
Eaters are not allowed visitors. It means I do not have to feel
ashamed of not going."</p>
<p>Harry had to swallow hard several times before he could speak.
"Can you tell me about Peter Pettigrew? He was my father's friend,
and it seems - that I should know, that I should remember -"</p>
<p>Remus nodded, water glittering in his own eyes now. "I think,
Harry, that if Peter had known it would end that way -" the man's
voice choked up. "Peter was more afraid of the Dark Lord than any
of us, and if he'd known it would end that way, I don't think he
would have done it. But Peter knew the <em>risk</em>, Harry, he
knew the risk was real, that it <em>could</em> happen, and yet he
stayed by James and Lily's side. All through Hogwarts I used to
wonder why Peter hadn't been sorted into Slytherin, or maybe
Ravenclaw, because Peter so adored secrets, he couldn't resist
them, he would find out things about people, things they wanted
kept hidden -" A brief wry look crossed Remus's face. "But he
didn't <em>use</em> those secrets, Harry. He just wanted to know.
And then the Dark Lord's shadow fell over everything, and Peter
stood by James and Lily and put his talents to good use, and I
understood why the Hat had sent him to Gryffindor." Remus's voice
was fierce now, and proud. "It's <em>easy</em> to stand by your
friends if you're a hero like Godric, bold and strong like people
think Gryffindors should be. But if Peter was more afraid than any
of us, doesn't that also make him the most brave?"</p>
<p>"It does," Harry said. His own voice was choked to where he
almost couldn't talk. "If you could, Mr. Lupin, if you have time,
there's someone else who I think should hear Peter Pettigrew's
story, a student in first-year Hufflepuff, named Neville
Longbottom."</p>
<p>"Alice and Frank's boy," said Remus, his voice turning sad. "I
see. It is not a happy story, Harry, but I can tell it again, if
you think it will help him."</p>
<p>Harry nodded.</p>
<p>A brief silence fell.</p>
<p>"Did Black have <em>any</em> unfinished business with Peter
Pettigrew?" Harry said. "<em>Anything</em> that would make him seek
out Mr. Pettigrew, even if it wasn't a killing matter? Like a
secret Mr. Pettigrew knew, that Black wanted to know himself, or
wanted to kill him to hide?"</p>
<p>Something flickered in Remus's eyes, but the older man shook his
head, and said, "Not really."</p>
<p>"That means there <em>is</em> something," said Harry.</p>
<p>That wry smile appeared again beneath the salt-and-pepper
mustache. "You have a bit of Peter in you yourself, I see. But it's
not important, Harry."</p>
<p>"I'm a Ravenclaw, I'm not <em>supposed</em> to resist the
temptation of secrets. And," Harry said more seriously, "if it was
worth Black getting caught, I can't help but think it might
matter."</p>
<p>Remus looked quite uncomfortable. "I suppose I could tell you
when you're older, but really, Harry, it's <em>not</em> important!
Just something from our school days."</p>
<p>Harry couldn't have put his finger on exactly what tipped him
off; it might have been something about the exact tone of
nervousness in Remus's voice, or the way the man had said <em>when
you're older</em>, that sparked the sudden leap of Harry's
intuition...</p>
<p>"Actually," said Harry, "I think I've sort of guessed it
already, sorry."</p>
<p>Remus raised his eyebrows. "Have you?" He sounded a bit
skeptical.</p>
<p>"They were lovers, weren't they?"</p>
<p>There was an awkward pause.</p>
<p>Remus gave a slow, grave nod.</p>
<p>"Once," Remus said. "A long time ago. A sad affair, ending in
vast tragedy, or so it seemed to us all when we were young." The
unhappy puzzlement was plain on his face. "But I had thought that
long since over and done and buried beneath adult friendship, until
the day that Black killed Peter."</p>

Whirr.</p>
<p>Professor Flitwick had silently passed Harry a folded parchment
during Charms class that Monday, and the note had said that Harry
was to visit the Headmaster at his convenience and in such fashion
that no one else would notice, especially not Draco Malfoy or
Professor Quirrell. His one-time password for the gargoyle would be
"squeamish ossifrage". This had been accompanied by a remarkably
artistic ink drawing of Professor Flitwick staring at him sternly,
the eyes of which occasionally blinked; and at the bottom of the
note, underlined three times, was the phrase DON'T GET INTO
TROUBLE.</p>
<p>And so Harry had finished up Transfiguration class, and studied
with Hermione, and eaten dinner, and spoken with his lieutenants,
and finally, when the clock struck nine, turned himself invisible
and dropped back to 6PM and wearily trudged off toward the
gargoyle, the turning spiral stairs, the wooden door, the room full
of little fiddly things, and the silver-bearded figure of the
Headmaster.</p>
<p>This time, Dumbledore looked quite serious, the customary smile
absent; and he was dressed in pajamas of a darker and more sober
purple than usual.</p>
<p>"Thank you for coming, Harry," said the Headmaster. The old
wizard rose from his throne, began to slowly pace through the room
and the strange devices. "First, do you have with you the notes of
yesterday's encounter with Lucius Malfoy?"</p>
<p>"Notes?" blurted Harry.</p>
<p>"<em>Surely</em> you wrote it down..." said the old wizard, and
his voice trailed off.</p>
<p>Harry felt rather embarrassed. Yes, if you'd just fumbled
through a mysterious conversation full of significant hints you
didn't understand, the <em>bloody obvious</em> thing to do would be
to write it all down immediately afterward, before the memory
faded, so you could try to figure it out later.</p>
<p>"All right," said the Headmaster, "from memory then."</p>
<p>Harry sheepishly recited as best he could, and got almost
halfway through before he realized that it wasn't smart to just go
around telling the possibly-crazy Headmaster everything, at least
not without <em>thinking</em> about it first, but then Lucius was
<em>definitely</em> a bad guy and Dumbledore's opponent so it
probably <em>was</em> a good idea to tell him, and Harry had
already started talking and it was too late to try and calculate
things out now...</p>
<p>Harry finished his recollections honestly.</p>
<p>Dumbledore's face had grown more remote as Harry went on, and at
the end there was a look of ancientness about him, a sternness in
the air.</p>
<p>"Well," said Dumbledore. "I suggest you take the best of care
that the heir of Malfoy does <em>not</em> come to harm, then. And I
will do the same." The Headmaster was frowning, his fingers
drumming soundlessly through the inky black surface of a plate
inscribed with the word <em>Leliel.</em> "And I think it would be
most extremely wise for you to avoid <em>all</em> interaction with
Lord Malfoy henceforth."</p>
<p>"<em>Did</em> you intercept owls from him to me?" said
Harry.</p>
<p>The Headmaster gazed at Harry for a long moment, then
reluctantly nodded.</p>
<p>For some reason Harry wasn't feeling as outraged as he should
have been. Maybe it was just that Harry was finding it very easy to
sympathize with the Headmaster's point of view right now. Even
Harry could understand why Dumbledore wouldn't want him to interact
with Lucius Malfoy; it didn't seem like an <em>evil</em> deed.</p>
<p>Not like the Headmaster blackmailing Zabini... for which they
had only Zabini's word, and Zabini was wildly untrustworthy, in
fact it was hard to see why Zabini <em>wouldn't</em> just tell the
story that got him the most sympathy from Professor Quirrell...</p>
<p>"How about if, instead of protesting, I say that I understand
your point of view," said Harry, "and you go on intercepting my
owls, but you tell me who from?"</p>
<p>"I have intercepted a great many owls to you, I am afraid,"
Dumbledore said soberly. "You are a celebrity, Harry, and you would
receive dozens of letters a day, some from far outside this
country, did I not turn them back."</p>
<p>"<em>That</em>," Harry said, now starting to feel a bit of
indignation, "seems like going a little too far -"</p>
<p>"Many of those letters," the old wizard said quietly, "will be
asking you for things you cannot give. I have not read them, of
course, only turned them back to their senders undelivered. But I
know, for I receive them too. And you are too young, Harry, to have
your heart broken six times before breakfast each morning."</p>
<p>Harry looked down at his shoes. He <em>should</em> insist on
reading the letters and judging for himself, but... there was a
small voice of common sense inside him, and it was screaming very
loudly right now.</p>
<p>"Thank you," Harry muttered.</p>
<p>"The other reason I asked you here," said the old wizard, "was
that I wished to consult your unique genius."</p>
<p>"Transfiguration?" said Harry, surprised and flattered.</p>
<p>"No, not <em>that</em> unique genius," said Dumbledore. "Tell
me, Harry, what evil could you accomplish if a Dementor were
allowed onto the grounds of Hogwarts?"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>It developed that Professor Quirrell had asked, or rather
demanded, that his students test their skills against an actual
Dementor after they learned the words and gestures to the Patronus
Charm.</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell is unable to cast the Patronus Charm
himself," said Dumbledore, as he paced slowly through the devices.
"Which is never a good sign. But then, he <em>volunteered</em> that
fact to me in the course of demanding that outside instructors be
brought in to teach the Patronus Charm to every student who wished
to learn; he offered to pay the expense himself, if I would not.
This impressed me greatly. But now he insists on bringing in a
Dementor -"</p>
<p>"Headmaster," Harry said quietly, "Professor Quirrell believes
<em>very</em> strongly in live-fire tests under realistic combat
conditions. Wanting to bring in an actual Dementor is
<em>completely</em> in character for him."</p>
<p>Now the Headmaster was giving Harry a strange look.</p>
<p>"<em>In character?</em> " said the old wizard.</p>
<p>"I mean," said Harry, "it's entirely consistent with the way
Professor Quirrell usually acts..." Harry trailed off. Why
<em>had</em> he put it that way?</p>
<p>The Headmaster nodded. "So you have the same sense I do; that it
is an excuse. A very <em>reasonable</em> excuse, to be sure; more
so than you may realize. Often, wizards seemingly unable to cast a
Patronus Charm will succeed in the presence of an actual Dementor,
going from not a single flicker of light to a full corporeal
Patronus. Why this should be, no one knows; but it is so."</p>
<p>Harry frowned. "Then I really don't see why you're suspicious
-"</p>
<p>The Headmaster spread his hands as though in helplessness.
"Harry, the <em>Defense Professor</em> has asked me to pass the
darkest of all creatures through the gates of Hogwarts. I
<em>must</em> be suspicious." The Headmaster sighed. "And yet the
Dementor will be guarded, warded, in a mighty cage, I will be there
myself to watch it at all times - I cannot think of what ill
<em>could</em> be done. But perhaps I am merely unable to see it.
And so I am asking you."</p>
<p>Harry stared at the Headmaster with his mouth open. He was so
shocked he couldn't even feel flattered.</p>
<p>"<em>Me?</em> " said Harry.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Dumbledore, smiling slightly. "I try my best to
anticipate my foes, to encompass their wicked minds and predict
their evil thoughts. But <em>I</em> would never have imagined
sharpening a Hufflepuff's bones into weapons."</p>
<p>Was Harry <em>ever</em> going to live that down?</p>
<p>"Headmaster," Harry said wearily, "I know it doesn't sound good,
but in all seriousness: I'm not evil, I'm just very creative -"</p>
<p>"I did not say that you were evil," Dumbledore said seriously.
"There are those who say that to comprehend evil is to become evil;
but they are merely pretending to be wise. Rather it is evil which
does not know love, and dares not imagine love, and cannot ever
understand love without ceasing to be evil. And I suspect that you
can imagine your way into the minds of Dark Wizards better than I
ever could, while still knowing love yourself. So, Harry." The
Headmaster's eyes were intent. "If you stood in Professor
Quirrell's shoes, what misdeeds could you accomplish after you
tricked me into allowing a Dementor onto the grounds of
Hogwarts?"</p>
<p>"Hold <em>on</em>," said Harry, and in something of a daze
trudged over to the chair in front of the Headmaster's desk, and
sat down. It was a large and comfortable chair this time, not a
wooden stool, and Harry could feel himself enveloped as he sank
into it.</p>
<p>Dumbledore was asking him to outwit Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>Point one: Harry was rather fonder of Professor Quirrell than of
Dumbledore.</p>
<p>Point two: The hypothesis was that the Defense Professor was
planning to do something evil, and in that subjunctive case, Harry
<em>ought</em> to be helping the Headmaster prevent it.</p>
<p>Point three...</p>
<p>"Headmaster," Harry said, "if Professor Quirrell <em>is</em> up
to something, I'm not sure I <em>can</em> outwit him. He's got a
lot more experience than I do."</p>
<p>The old wizard shook his head, somehow managing to appear very
solemn despite his smile. "You underestimate yourself."</p>
<p>That was the first time anyone had ever said <em>that</em> to
Harry.</p>
<p>"I remember," the old wizard continued, "a young man in this
very office, cold and controlled as he faced down the Head of House
Slytherin, blackmailing his own Headmaster to protect his
classmates. And I believe that young man is more cunning than
Professor Quirrell, more cunning than Lucius Malfoy, that he will
grow to be the equal of Voldemort himself. It is he who I wish to
consult."</p>
<p>Harry suppressed the chill that went through him at the name,
frowned thoughtfully at the Headmaster.</p>
<p><em>How much does he know...?</em></p>
<p>The Headmaster had seen Harry in the grip of his mysterious dark
side, as deep as Harry had ever sunk into it. Harry still
remembered what it had been like to watch, invisibly Time-Turned,
as his past self faced down the older Slytherins; the boy with the
scar on his forehead who didn't act like the others. <em>Of
course</em> the Headmaster would have noticed something odd about
the boy in his office...</p>
<p>And Dumbledore had concluded that his pet hero had cunning to
match his destined foe, the Dark Lord.</p>
<p>Which wasn't asking for very much, considering that the Dark
Lord had put a clearly visible Dark Mark on all of his servants'
left arms, and that he'd slaughtered the entire monastery that
taught the martial art he'd wanted to learn.</p>
<p>Enough cunning to match <em>Professor Quirrell</em> would be a
<em>whole</em> different order of problem.</p>
<p>But it was also clear that the Headmaster wouldn't be satisfied
until Harry went all cold and darkish, and came up with some sort
of answer that sounded impressively cunning... which had better not
<em>actually</em> get in the way of Professor Quirrell's teaching
Defense...</p>
<p>And of course Harry <em>would</em> go over to his dark side and
think it through from that direction, just to be honest, and just
in case.</p>
<p>"Tell me," Harry said, "everything about how the Dementor is to
be brought in, and how it is to be guarded."</p>
<p>Dumbledore's eyebrows rose for a moment, and then the old wizard
began to speak.</p>
<p>The Dementor would be transported to the grounds of Hogwarts by
an Auror trio, all three personally known to the Headmaster, and
all three able to cast a corporeal Patronus Charm. They would be
met at the edge of the grounds by Dumbledore, who would pass the
Dementor through the Hogwarts wards -</p>
<p>Harry asked if the pass was permanent or temporary - whether
someone could just bring in the same Dementor again the next
day.</p>
<p>The pass was temporary (replied the Headmaster with an approving
nod), and the explanation went on: The Dementor would be in a cage
of solid titanium bars, not Transfigured but true-forged; in time a
Dementor's presence would corrode that metal to dust, but not in a
single day.</p>
<p>Students awaiting their turn would stay well back of the
Dementor, behind two corporeal Patronuses maintained by two of the
three Aurors at any given time. Dumbledore would wait by the
Dementor's cage with his Patronus. A single student would approach
the Dementor; and Dumbledore would dispel his Patronus; and the
student would attempt to cast their own Patronus Charm; and if they
failed, Dumbledore would restore his Patronus before the student
could suffer any permanent damage. Past dueling champion Professor
Flitwick would also be present while there were students near, just
to add safety margin.</p>
<p>"Why just <em>you</em> waiting by the Dementor?" said Harry. "I
mean, shouldn't it be you plus an Auror -"</p>
<p>The Headmaster shook his head. "They could not withstand the
repeated exposure to the Dementor, each time I dispel my
Patronus."</p>
<p>And if Dumbledore's Patronus did fail for some reason, while one
of the students was still near the Dementor, the third Auror would
cast another corporeal Patronus and send it to shield the
student...</p>
<p>Harry poked and prodded, but he couldn't see a flaw in the
security.</p>
<p>So Harry took a deep breath, sank further into the chair, closed
his eyes, and remembered:</p>
<p><em>"And that will be... five points? No, let us make it an even
ten points from Ravenclaw for backchat."</em></p>
<p>The cold came more slowly now, more reluctantly, Harry hadn't
been calling much on his dark side lately...</p>
<p>Harry had to run through that entire session in Potions in his
mind, before his blood chilled into something approaching deadly
crystalline clarity.</p>
<p>And then he thought of the Dementor.</p>
<p>And it was obvious.</p>
<p>"The Dementor is a distraction," Harry said. The coldness clear
in his voice, since that was what Dumbledore wanted and expected.
"A large, salient threat, but in the end straightforward, and easy
to defend against. So while all your attention is focused on the
Dementor, the real plot will be happening elsewhere."</p>
<p>Dumbledore stared at Harry for a moment, and then gave a slow
nod. "Yes..." said the Headmaster. "And I do believe I know what it
might be a distraction <em>from</em>, if Professor Quirrell means
ill... thank you, Harry."</p>
<p>The Headmaster was still staring at Harry, a strange look in
those ancient eyes.</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " said Harry with a tinge of annoyance, the cold
still lingering in his blood.</p>
<p>"I have another question for that young man," said the
Headmaster. "It is something I have long wondered to myself, yet
been unable to comprehend. <em>Why?</em> " There was a tinge of
pain in his voice. "Why would anyone deliberately make himself a
monster? Why do evil for the sake of evil? Why Voldemort?"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Whirr, bzzzt, tick; ding, puff, splat...</em></p>
<p>Harry stared at the Headmaster in surprise.</p>
<p>"How would <em>I</em> know?" said Harry. "Am I supposed to
magically understand the Dark Lord because I'm the hero, or
something?"</p>
<p>"<em>Yes!</em> " said Dumbledore. "My own great foe was
Grindelwald, and <em>him</em> I understood very well indeed.
Grindelwald was my dark mirror, the man I could so easily have
been, had I given in to the temptation to believe that I was a good
person, and therefore always in the right. <em>For the greater
good</em>, that was his slogan; and he truly believed it himself,
even as he tore at all Europe like a wounded animal. And him, I
defeated in the end. But then after him came Voldemort, to destroy
everything I had protected in Britain." The hurt was plain now in
Dumbledore's voice, exposed upon his face. "He committed acts worse
by far than Grindelwald's worst, horror for the sake of horror. I
sacrificed everything only to hold him back, and I still don't
understand <em>why!</em> <em>Why</em>, Harry? Why did he do it? He
was never my destined foe, but yours, so if you have any guesses at
all, Harry, please tell me! <em>Why?</em> "</p>
<p>Harry stared down at his hands. The truth was that Harry hadn't
read up on the Dark Lord yet, and right now he hadn't the tiniest
clue. And somehow that didn't seem like an answer the Headmaster
wanted to hear. "Too many Dark rituals, maybe? In the beginning he
thought he'd do just one, but it sacrificed part of his good side,
and that made him less reluctant to perform other Dark rituals, so
he did more and more rituals in a positive feedback cycle until he
ended up as a tremendously powerful monster -"</p>
<p>"No!" Now the Headmaster's voice was agonized. "I can't believe
that, Harry! There has to be something more to it than just
that!"</p>
<p><em>Why should there be?</em> thought Harry, but he didn't say
it, because it was clear that the Headmaster thought the universe
was a story and had a plot, and that huge tragedies weren't allowed
to happen except for equally huge, significant reasons. "I'm sorry,
Headmaster. The Dark Lord doesn't seem like much of a dark mirror
to me, not at all. There isn't anything I find even the
<em>tiniest</em> bit tempting about nailing the skins of Yermy
Wibble's family to a newsroom wall."</p>
<p>"Have you <em>no</em> wisdom to share?" said Dumbledore. There
was pleading in the old wizard's voice, almost begging.</p>
<p><em>Evil happens,</em> thought Harry, <em>it doesn't mean
anything or teach us anything, except to not be evil? The Dark Lord
was probably just a selfish bastard who didn't care who he hurt, or
an idiot who made stupidly avoidable mistakes that snowballed.
There is no destiny behind the ills of this world; if Hitler had
been allowed into architecture school like he wanted, the whole
history of Europe would have been different; if we lived in the
sort of universe where horrible things were only allowed to happen
for good reasons, they just wouldn't happen in the first
place.</em></p>
<p>And none of that, obviously, was what the Headmaster wanted to
hear.</p>
<p>The old wizard was still looking at Harry from over a fiddly
thing like a frozen puff of smoke, a painful desperation in those
ancient, waiting eyes.</p>
<p>Well, sounding wise wasn't difficult. It was a lot easier than
being intelligent, actually, since you didn't have to say anything
surprising or come up with any new insights. You just let your
brain's pattern-matching software complete the cliche, using
whatever Deep Wisdom you'd stored previously.</p>
<p>"Headmaster," Harry said solemnly, "I would rather not define
myself by my enemies."</p>
<p>Somehow, even in the midst of all the whirring and ticking,
there was a kind of silence.</p>
<p>That had come out a bit more Deeply Wise than Harry had
intended.</p>
<p>"You may be very wise, Harry..." the Headmaster said slowly. "I
do wish... that I could have been defined by my friends." The pain
in his voice had grown deeper.</p>
<p>Harry's mind searched hastily for something else Deeply Wise to
say that would soften the unintended force of the blow -</p>
<p>"Or perhaps," Harry said more softly, "it is the foe that makes
the Gryffindor, as it is the friend that makes the Hufflepuff, and
the ambition that makes the Slytherin. I do know that it is always,
in every generation, the puzzle that makes the scientist."</p>
<p>"It is a dreadful fate to which you condemn my House, Harry,"
said the Headmaster. The pain was still in his voice. "For now that
you remark on it, I do think that I was very much made by my
enemies."</p>
<p>Harry stared at his own hands, where they lay in his lap. Maybe
he should just shut up while he was ahead.</p>
<p>"But you <em>have</em> answered my question," said Dumbledore
more softly, as though to himself. "I should have realized that
would be a Slytherin's key. For his ambition, all for the sake of
his ambition; and <em>that</em> I know, though not <em>why</em>..."
For a time Dumbledore stared off into nothingness; then he
straightened, and his eyes seemed to focus on Harry again.</p>
<p>"And you, Harry," said the Headmaster, "you name yourself a
<em>scientist?</em> " His voice was laced with surprise and mild
disapproval.</p>
<p>"You don't like science?" said Harry a little wearily. He'd
hoped Dumbledore would be fonder of Muggle things.</p>
<p>"I suppose it is useful to those without wands," said
Dumbledore, frowning. "But it seems a strange thing by which to
define yourself. Is science as important as love? As kindness? As
friendship? Is it science that makes you fond of Minerva
McGonagall? Is it science that makes you care for Hermione Granger?
Will it be science to which you turn, when you try to kindle warmth
in Draco Malfoy's heart?"</p>
<p><em>You know, the sad thing is, you probably think you just
uttered some kind of incredibly wise knockdown argument.</em></p>
<p>Now, how to phrase the rejoinder in such fashion that it also
sounded incredibly wise...</p>
<p>"You are not Ravenclaw," Harry said with calm dignity, "and so
it might not have occurred to you that to respect the truth, and
seek it all the days of your life, could also be an act of
grace."</p>
<p>The Headmaster's eyebrows rose up. And then he sighed. "How did
you become so wise, so young...?" The old wizard sounded sad, as he
said it. "Perhaps it will prove valuable to you."</p>
<p><em>Only for impressing ancient wizards who are overly impressed
with themselves,</em> thought Harry. He was actually a bit
disappointed by Dumbledore's credulity; it wasn't that Harry had
<em>lied</em>, but Dumbledore seemed far too impressed with Harry's
ability to phrase things so that they sounded profound, instead of
putting them into plain English like Richard Feynman had done with
<em>his</em> wisdom...</p>
<p>"Love is more important than wisdom," said Harry, just to test
the limits of Dumbledore's tolerance for blindingly obvious cliches
completed by sheer pattern matching without any sort of detailed
analysis.</p>
<p>The Headmaster nodded gravely, and said, "Indeed."</p>
<p>Harry stood up out of the chair, and stretched his arms.
<em>Well, I'd better go off and love something, then, that's bound
to help me defeat the Dark Lord. And next time you ask me for
advice, I'll just give you a hug -</em></p>
<p>"This day you have helped me much, Harry," said the Headmaster.
"And so there is one last thing I would ask that young man."</p>
<p><em>Great.</em></p>
<p>"Tell me, Harry," said the Headmaster (and now his voice sounded
simply puzzled, though there was still a hint of pain in his eyes),
"why do Dark Wizards fear death so greatly?"</p>
<p>"Er," said Harry, "sorry, I've got to back the Dark Wizards on
that one."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Whoosh, hiss, chime; glorp, pop, bubble -</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " said Dumbledore.</p>
<p>"Death is bad," said Harry, discarding wisdom for the sake of
clear communication. "Very bad. Extremely bad. Being scared of
death is like being scared of a great big monster with poisonous
fangs. It actually makes a great deal of sense, and does not, in
fact, indicate that you have a psychological problem."</p>
<p>The Headmaster was staring at him as though he'd just turned
into a cat.</p>
<p>"Okay," said Harry, "let me put it this way. Do you
<em>want</em> to die? Because if so, there's this Muggle thing
called a suicide prevention hotline -"</p>
<p>"When it is time," the old wizard said quietly. "Not before. I
would never seek to hasten the day, nor seek to refuse it when it
comes."</p>
<p>Harry was frowning sternly. "That doesn't sound like you have a
very strong will to live, Headmaster!"</p>
<p>"Harry..." The old wizard's voice was starting to sound a little
helpless; and he had paced to a spot where his silver beard,
unnoticed, had drifted into a crystalline glass goldfish bowl, and
was slowly taking on a greenish tinge that crept up the hairs. "I
think I may have not made myself clear. Dark Wizards are not eager
to live. They <em>fear death.</em> They do not reach up toward the
sun's light, but flee the coming of night into infinitely darker
caverns of their own making, without moon or stars. It is not life
they desire, but <em>immortality;</em> and they are so driven to
grasp at it that they will sacrifice their very souls! Do you want
to live <em>forever</em>, Harry?"</p>
<p>"Yes, and so do you," said Harry. "I want to live one more day.
Tomorrow I will still want to live one more day. Therefore I want
to live forever, proof by induction on the positive integers. If
you don't want to die, it means you want to live forever. If you
don't want to live forever, it means you want to die. You've got to
do one or the other... I'm not getting through here, am I."</p>
<p>The two cultures stared at each other across a vast gap of
incommensurability.</p>
<p>"I have lived a hundred and ten years," the old wizard said
quietly (taking his beard out of the bowl, and jiggling it to shake
out the color). "I have seen and done a great many things, too many
of which I wish I had never seen or done. And yet I do not regret
being alive, for watching my students grow is a joy that has not
begun to wear on me. But I would not wish to live so long that it
does! What would you <em>do</em> with eternity, Harry?"</p>
<p>Harry took a deep breath. "Meet all the interesting people in
the world, read all the good books and then write something even
better, celebrate my first grandchild's tenth birthday party on the
Moon, celebrate my first great-great-great grandchild's hundredth
birthday party around the Rings of Saturn, learn the deepest and
final rules of Nature, understand the nature of consciousness, find
out why anything exists in the first place, visit other stars,
discover aliens, create aliens, rendezvous with everyone for a
party on the other side of the Milky Way once we've explored the
whole thing, meet up with everyone else who was born on Old Earth
to watch the Sun finally go out, and I used to worry about finding
a way to escape this universe before it ran out of negentropy but
I'm a lot more hopeful now that I've discovered the so-called laws
of physics are just optional guidelines."</p>
<p>"I did not understand much of that," said Dumbledore. "But I
must ask if these are things that you truly desire so desperately,
or if you only imagine them so as to imagine not being tired, as
you run and run from death."</p>
<p>"Life is not a finite list of things that you check off before
you're allowed to die," Harry said firmly. "It's life, you just go
on living it. If I'm not doing those things it'll be because I've
found something better."</p>
<p>Dumbledore sighed. His fingers drummed on a clock; as they
touched it, the numerals changed to an indecipherable script, and
the hands briefly appeared in different positions. "In the unlikely
event that I am permitted to tarry until a hundred and fifty," said
the old wizard, "I do not think I would mind. But two hundred years
would be entirely too much of a good thing."</p>
<p>"Yes, well," Harry said, his voice a little dry as he thought of
his Mum and Dad and <em>their</em> allotted span if Harry didn't do
something about it, "I suspect, Headmaster, that if you came from a
culture where people were accustomed to living four hundred years,
that dying at two hundred would seem just as tragically premature
as dying at, say, <em>eighty</em>." Harry's voice went hard, on
that last word.</p>
<p>"Perhaps," the old wizard said peacefully. "I would not wish to
die before my friends, nor live on after they had all gone. The
hardest time is when those you loved the most have gone on before
you, and yet others still live, for whose sake you must stay..."
Dumbledore's eyes were fixed on Harry, and growing sad. "Do not
mourn me too greatly, Harry, when my time comes; I will be with
those I have long missed, on our next great adventure."</p>
<p>"Oh!" Harry said in sudden realization. "You believe in an
<em>afterlife</em>. I got the impression wizards didn't have
religion?"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Toot. Beep. Thud.</p>
<p>"<em>How can you not believe it?</em> " said the Headmaster,
looking completely flabbergasted. "<em>Harry, you're a wizard!
You've seen ghosts!</em> "</p>
<p>"Ghosts," Harry said, his voice flat. "You mean those things
like portraits, stored memories and behaviors with no awareness or
life, accidentally impressed into the surrounding material by the
burst of magic that accompanies the violent death of a wizard
-"</p>
<p>"I've heard that theory," said the Headmaster, his voice growing
sharp, "repeated by wizards who mistake cynicism for wisdom, who
think that to look down upon others is to elevate themselves. It is
one of the silliest ideas I have heard in a hundred and ten years!
<em>Yes,</em> ghosts do not learn or grow, because this is <em>not
where they belong!</em> Souls are meant to move on, there is no
life remaining for them <em>here!</em> And if not ghosts, then what
of the Veil? What of the Resurrection Stone?"</p>
<p>"All right," Harry said, trying to keep his voice calm, "I'll
hear out your evidence, because <em>that's what a scientist
does.</em> But first, Headmaster, let me tell you a little story."
Harry's voice was trembling. "You know, when I got here, when I got
off the train from King's Cross, I don't mean yesterday but back in
September, when I got off the train then, Headmaster, I'd never
seen a ghost. I wasn't <em>expecting</em> ghosts. So when I saw
them, Headmaster, I did something really dumb. I <em>jumped to
conclusions.</em> I, I thought there <em>was</em> an afterlife, I
thought no one had ever really died, I thought that everyone the
human species had ever lost was really fine after all, I thought
that wizards could talk to people who'd passed on, that it just
took the right spell to summon them, that wizards could <em>do</em>
that, I thought I could meet my parents who died for me, and tell
them that I'd heard about their sacrifice and that I'd begun to
call them my mother and father -"</p>
<p>"Harry," whispered Dumbledore. Water glittered in the old
wizard's eyes. He took a step closer across the office -</p>
<p>"And <em>then,</em>" spat Harry, the fury coming fully into his
voice, the cold rage at the universe for being like that and at
himself for being so stupid, "I asked Hermione and she said that
they were just <em>afterimages,</em> burned into the stone of the
castle by the death of a wizard, like the silhouettes left on the
walls of Hiroshima. And I should have known! I should have known
without even having to ask! I shouldn't have believed it even for
all of thirty seconds! Because if people had souls there wouldn't
be any such thing as brain damage, if your soul could go on
speaking after your whole brain was gone, how could damage to the
left cerebral hemisphere take away your ability to talk? And
Professor McGonagall, when she told me about how my parents had
died, she didn't act like they'd just gone away on a long trip to
another country, like they'd emigrated to Australia back in the
days of sailing ships, which is the way people would act if they
<em>actually knew</em> that death was just going somewhere else, if
they had hard evidence for an afterlife, instead of making stuff up
to console themselves, it would change <em>everything,</em> it
wouldn't <em>matter</em> that everyone had lost someone in the war,
it would be a little sad but not <em>horrible!</em> And I'd already
seen that people in the wizarding world didn't act like that! So I
should have known better! And that was when I knew that my parents
were really dead and gone forever and ever, that there wasn't
anything left of them, that I'd never get a chance to meet them
and, and, and the other children thought I was crying because I was
<em>scared of ghosts -</em>"</p>
<p>The old wizard's face was horrified, he opened his mouth to
speak -</p>
<p>"So tell me, Headmaster! Tell me about the evidence! But
<em>don't you dare</em> exaggerate a single tiny bit of it, because
if you give me false hope again, and I find out later that you lied
or stretched things just a little, I won't ever forgive you for it!
<em>What's the Veil?</em> "</p>
<p>Harry reached up and wiped at his cheeks, while the glass things
of the office stopped vibrating from his last shriek.</p>
<p>"The Veil," said the old wizard with only a slight tremble in
his voice, "is a great stone archway, kept in the Department of
Mysteries; a gateway to the land of the dead."</p>
<p>"And how does anyone know that?" said Harry. "Don't tell me what
you believe, tell me what you've <em>seen!</em> "</p>
<p>The physical manifestation of the barrier between worlds was a
great stone archway, old and tall and coming to a sharp point, with
a tattered black veil like the surface of a pool of water,
stretched between the stones; rippling, always, from the constant
and one-way passage of the souls. If you stood by the Veil you
could hear the voices of the dead calling, always calling in
whispers barely on the wrong side of comprehension, growing louder
and more numerous if you stayed and tried to hear, as they tried to
communicate; and if you listened too long, you would go to meet
them, and in the moment you touched the Veil you would be sucked
through, and never be heard from again.</p>
<p>"That doesn't even sound like an <em>interesting</em> fraud,"
Harry said, his voice calmer now that there was nothing there to
make him hope, or make him angry for having hopes dashed. "Someone
built a stone archway, made a little black rippling surface between
it that Vanished anything it touched, and enchanted it to whisper
to people and hypnotize them."</p>
<p>"Harry..." the Headmaster said, starting to look rather worried.
"I can tell you the truth, but if you refuse to hear it..."</p>
<p><em>Also not interesting.</em> "What's the Resurrection
Stone?"</p>
<p>"I would not tell you," the Headmaster said slowly, "save that I
fear what this disbelief may do to you... so listen, then, Harry,
please listen..."</p>
<p>The Resurrection Stone was one of the three legendary Deathly
Hallows, kin to Harry's cloak. The Resurrection Stone could call
souls back from the dead - bring them back into the world of the
living, though not as they were. Cadmus Peverell used the stone to
call back his lost beloved from the dead, but her heart stayed with
the dead, and not in the world of the living. And in time it drove
him mad, and he killed himself to be truly with her once
more...</p>
<p>In all politeness, Harry raised his hand.</p>
<p>"Yes?" the Headmaster said reluctantly.</p>
<p>"The obvious test to see if the Resurrection Stone is
<em>really</em> calling back the dead, or just projecting an image
from the user's mind, is to ask a question whose answer
<em>you</em> don't know, but the dead person <em>would</em>, and
that can be definitely verified in this world. For example, call
back -"</p>
<p>Then Harry paused, because <em>this</em> time he'd managed to
think it through one step ahead of his tongue, fast enough to
<em>not</em> say the first name and test that had sprung to
mind.</p>
<p>"...your dead wife, and ask her where she left her lost earring,
or something like that," Harry finished. "Did anyone do any tests
like that?"</p>
<p>"The Resurrection Stone has been lost for centuries, Harry," the
Headmaster said quietly.</p>
<p>Harry shrugged. "Well, I'm a scientist, and I'm always willing
to be convinced. If you <em>really</em> believe the Resurrection
Stone calls back the dead - then you must believe a test like that
will succeed, right? So do you know anything about where to find
the Resurrection Stone? I got <em>one</em> Deathly Hallow already
under highly mysterious circumstances, and, well, we both know how
the rhythm of the world works on that sort of thing."</p>
<p>Dumbledore stared at Harry.</p>
<p>Harry gazed equably back at the Headmaster.</p>
<p>The old wizard passed a hand across his forehead and muttered,
"This is madness."</p>
<p>(Somehow, Harry managed to stop himself from laughing.)</p>
<p>And Dumbledore told Harry to draw forth the Cloak of
Invisibility from his pouch; at the Headmaster's direction, Harry
stared at the inside and back of the hood until he saw it, faintly
drawn against the silvery mesh in faded scarlet like dried blood,
the symbol of the Deathly Hallows: a triangle, with a circle drawn
inside, and a line dividing them both.</p>
<p>"Thank you," Harry said politely. "I shall be sure to keep an
eye out for a stone so marked. Do you have any other evidence?"</p>
<p>Dumbledore appeared to be fighting a struggle within himself.
"Harry," the old wizard said, his voice rising, "this is a
dangerous road you are walking, I am not sure I do the right thing
by saying this, but I <em>must</em> wrench you from this way!
Harry, <em>how could Voldemort have survived the death of his body
if he did not have a soul?</em> "</p>
<p>And <em>that</em> was when Harry realized that there was exactly
one person who'd <em>originally</em> told Professor McGonagall that
the Dark Lord was still alive in the first place; and it was the
crazy Headmaster of their madhouse of a school, who thought the
world ran on cliches.</p>
<p>"Good question," Harry said, after some internal debate about
how to proceed. "Maybe he found some way of duplicating the power
of the Resurrection Stone, only he loaded it in advance with a
<em>complete</em> copy of his brain state. Or something like that."
Harry was suddenly far from sure that he was trying to come up with
an explanation for something that had <em>actually happened</em>.
"Actually, can you just go ahead and tell me everything you know
about how the Dark Lord survived and what it might take to kill
him?" <em>If he even still exists as more than Quibbler
headlines.</em></p>
<p>"You are not fooling me, Harry," said the old wizard; his face
looked ancient now, and lined by more than years. "I know why you
are truly asking that question. No, I do not read your mind, I do
not have to, your hesitation gives you away! You seek the secret of
the Dark Lord's immortality in order to use it for yourself!"</p>
<p>"Wrong! I want the secret of the Dark Lord's immortality in
order to use it for <em>everyone!</em> "</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Tick, crackle, fzzzt...</p>
<p>Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore just stood there and
stared at Harry with his mouth gaping open dumbly.</p>
<p>(Harry awarded himself a tally mark for Monday, since he'd
managed to blow someone's mind completely before the day was
over.)</p>
<p>"And in case it wasn't clear," said Harry, "by <em>everyone</em>
I mean all Muggles too, not just all wizards."</p>
<p>"No," said the old wizard, shaking his head. His voice rose.
"No, no, no! <em>This is insanity!</em> "</p>
<p>"Bwa ha ha!" said Harry.</p>
<p>The old wizard's face was tight with anger and worry. "Voldemort
stole the book from which he gleaned his secret; it was not there
when I went to look for it. But this much I know, and this much I
will tell you: his immortality was born of a ritual terrible and
Dark, blacker than pitchest black! And it was Myrtle, poor sweet
Myrtle, who died for it; his immortality took sacrifice, it took
<em>murder -</em>"</p>
<p>"Well <em>obviously</em> I'm not going to popularize a method of
immortality that requires killing people! That would defeat the
<em>entire point!</em> "</p>
<p>There was a startled pause.</p>
<p>Slowly the old wizard's face relaxed out of its anger, though
the worry was still there. "You would use no ritual requiring human
sacrifice."</p>
<p>"I don't know what you take me for, <em>Headmaster,</em>" Harry
said coldly, his own anger rising, "but let's not forget that
<em>I'm</em> the one who wants people to <em>live!</em> The one who
wants to <em>save</em> everyone! <em>You're</em> the one who thinks
death is awesome and everyone ought to die!"</p>
<p>"I am at a loss, Harry," said the old wizard. His feet once more
began trudging across his strange office. "I know not what to say."
He picked up a crystal ball that seemed to hold a hand in flames,
looked into it with a sad expression. "Only that I am greatly
misunderstood by you... I don't <em>want</em> everyone to die,
Harry!"</p>
<p>"You just don't want anyone to be immortal," Harry said with
considerable irony. It seemed that elementary logical tautologies
like <em>All x: Die(x) = Not Exist x: Not Die(x)</em> were beyond
the reasoning abilities of the world's most powerful wizard.</p>
<p>The old wizard nodded. "I am less afraid than I was, but still
greatly worried for you, Harry," he said quietly. His hand, a
little wizened by time, but still strong, placed the crystal ball
firmly back into its stand. "For the fear of death is a bitter
thing, an illness of the soul by which people are twisted and
warped. Voldemort is not the only Dark Wizard to go down that bleak
road, though I fear he has taken it further than any before
him."</p>
<p>"And you think <em>you're</em> not afraid of death?" Harry said,
not even trying to mask the incredulity in his voice.</p>
<p>The old wizard's face was peaceful. "I am not perfect, Harry,
but I think I have accepted my death as part of myself."</p>
<p>"Uh huh," Harry said. "See, there's this little thing called
<em>cognitive dissonance,</em> or in plainer English, <em>sour
grapes.</em> If people were hit on the heads with truncheons once a
month, and no one could do anything about it, pretty soon there'd
be all sorts of philosophers, <em>pretending to be wise</em> as you
put it, who found all sorts of <em>amazing benefits</em> to being
hit on the head with a truncheon once a month. Like, it makes you
tougher, or it makes you happier on the days when you're
<em>not</em> getting hit with a truncheon. But if you went up to
someone who <em>wasn't</em> getting hit, and you asked them if they
wanted to <em>start</em>, in exchange for those <em>amazing
benefits,</em> they'd say no. And if you <em>didn't</em> have to
die, if you came from somewhere that no one had ever even
<em>heard</em> of death, and I suggested to you that it would be an
<em>amazing wonderful great idea</em> for people to get wrinkled
and old and eventually cease to exist, why, you'd have me hauled
right off to a lunatic asylum! So why would anyone possibly think
any thought so silly as that death is a <em>good</em> thing?
Because you're afraid of it, because you don't <em>really</em> want
to die, and that thought hurts so much inside you that you have to
rationalize it away, do something to numb the pain, so you won't
have to think about it -"</p>
<p>"No, Harry," the old wizard said. His face was gentle, his hand
trailed through a lighted pool of water that made small musical
chimes as his fingers stirred it. "Though I can understand how you
must think so."</p>
<p>"Do you want to understand the Dark Wizard?" Harry said, his
voice now hard and grim. "Then look within the part of yourself
that flees not from death but from the <em>fear</em> of death, that
finds that fear so unbearable that it will embrace Death as a
friend and cozen up to it, try to become one with the night so that
it can think itself master of the abyss. You have taken the most
terrible of all evils and called it good! With only a slight twist
that same part of yourself would murder innocents, and call it
friendship. If you can call death better than life then you can
twist your moral compass to point <em>anywhere -</em>"</p>
<p>"I think," said Dumbledore, shaking water droplets from his hand
to the sound of tiny tinkling bells, "that you understand Dark
Wizards <em>very</em> well, without yet being one yourself." It was
said in perfect seriousness, and without accusation. "But your
comprehension of <em>me</em>, I fear, is sorely lacking." The old
wizard was smiling now, and there was a gentle laughter in his
voice.</p>
<p>Harry was trying not to go any colder than he already was; from
somewhere there was pouring into his mind a blazing fury of
resentment, at Dumbledore's condescension, and all the laughter
that wise old fools had ever used in place of argument. "Funny
thing, you know, I thought Draco Malfoy was going to be this
impossible to talk to, and instead, in his childish innocence, he
was a hundred times stronger than you."</p>
<p>A look of puzzlement crossed the old wizard's face. "What do you
mean?"</p>
<p>"I mean," Harry said, his voice biting, "that Draco actually
<em>took his own beliefs seriously</em> and <em>processed</em> my
words instead of <em>throwing them out the window</em> by smiling
with gentle superiority. You're so old and wise, you can't even
<em>notice</em> anything I'm saying! Not understand,
<em>notice!</em> "</p>
<p>"I <em>have</em> listened to you, Harry," said Dumbledore,
looking more solemn now, "but to listen is not always to agree.
Disagreements aside, what is it that you think I do not
comprehend?"</p>
<p><em>That if you</em> really <em>believed in an afterlife, you'd
go down to St. Mungo's and kill Neville's parents, Alice and Frank
Longbottom, so they could go on to their</em> next great
adventure<em>, instead of letting them linger here in their damaged
state -</em></p>
<p>Harry barely, <em>barely</em> kept himself from saying it out
loud.</p>
<p>"All right," Harry said coldly. "I'll answer your original
question, then. You asked why Dark Wizards are afraid of death.
Pretend, Headmaster, that you <em>really</em> believed in souls.
Pretend that anyone could verify the existence of souls at any
time, pretend that nobody cried at funerals because they
<em>knew</em> their loved ones were still alive. Now can you
imagine <em>destroying</em> a soul? Ripping it to shreds so that
nothing remains to go on its next great adventure? Can you imagine
what a terrible thing that would be, the worst crime that had ever
been committed in the history of the universe, which you would do
anything to prevent from happening even once? Because
<em>that's</em> what Death really is - the annihilation of a
soul!"</p>
<p>The old wizard was staring at him, a sad look in his eyes. "I
suppose I <em>do</em> understand now," he said quietly.</p>
<p>"Oh?" said Harry. "Understand what?"</p>
<p>"Voldemort," said the old wizard. "I understand him now at last.
Because to believe that the world is truly like that, you must
believe there is no justice in it, that it is woven of darkness at
its core. I asked you why he became a monster, and you could give
no reason. And if I could ask <em>him</em>, I suppose, his answer
would be: Why not?"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>They stood there gazing into each other's eyes, the old wizard
in his robes, and the young boy with the lightning-bolt scar on his
forehead.</p>
<p>"Tell me, Harry," said the old wizard, "will <em>you</em> become
a monster?"</p>
<p>"No," said the boy, an iron certainty in his voice.</p>
<p>"Why not?" said the old wizard.</p>
<p>The young boy stood very straight, his chin raised high and
proud, and said: "There is no justice in the laws of Nature,
Headmaster, no term for fairness in the equations of motion. The
universe is neither evil, nor good, it simply does not care. The
stars don't care, or the Sun, or the sky. But they don't have to!
<em>We</em> care! There <em>is</em> light in the world, and it is
<em>us!</em> "</p>
<p>"I wonder what will become of you, Harry," said the old wizard.
His voice was soft, with a strange wonder and regret in it. "It is
enough to make me wish to live just to see it."</p>
<p>The boy bowed to him with heavy irony, and departed; and the
oaken door slammed shut behind him with a thud.</p>

<p>"Fawkes," said Albus Dumbledore, his voice cracking, "help him,
please -"</p>
<p>A brilliant creature of red-gold shuffled into the field of
vision, looking down quizzically; and it began to croon.</p>
<p>The meaningless chirps slid off the emptiness, there was nothing
onto which they could hold.</p>
<p>"You're noisy," said the voice, "you should die."</p>
<p>"Chocolate," Albus Dumbledore said, "you need chocolate, and
your friends - but I dare not take you back -"</p>
<p>Then a shining raven came, and spoke in Professor Flitwick's
voice; whereupon Albus Dumbledore gasped in sudden comprehension,
and cursed aloud at his own stupidity.</p>
<p>The empty thing laughed at that, for it had retained the
capacity to be amused.</p>
<p>And a moment later they had all vanished in another flash of
fire.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>It was only a moment, it seemed, between when Flitwick's raven
had flown to elsewhere, and when Albus Dumbledore reappeared in
another crack of red and golden fire with Harry in his arms; but
somehow in that time Hermione had already managed to fill her hands
with chocolate.</p>
<p>Before Hermione even got there, chocolate had zoomed off the
table and straight into Harry's mouth, which a tiny part of her
mind said was unfair, <em>he'd</em> gotten a chance to do it for
<em>her -</em></p>
<p>Harry spat the chocolate back out again.</p>
<p>"Go away," said a voice so empty it wasn't even cold.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Everything seemed to freeze, everyone who had been moving toward
Harry halted, all movements broken by the shock of those two dead
words.</p>
<p>Then: "No," said Albus Dumbledore, "I will not," and time
resumed again, even as another piece of chocolate zoomed off the
table and into Harry's mouth.</p>
<p>Hermione was close enough now that she could see Harry's
expression become more hateful, as his mouth chewed with a
mechanical, unnatural rhythm.</p>
<p>The Headmaster's voice was grim as iron. "Filius, call Minerva,
tell her she must come at speed."</p>
<p>Professor Flitwick whispered to his silver raven, and it flew
into the air and vanished.</p>
<p>Another piece of chocolate floated into Harry's mouth, and the
mechanical chewing continued.</p>
<p>There were more students gathering around where the Headmaster
watched over Harry with grim eyes: Neville, Seamus, Dean, Lavender,
Ernie, Terry, Anthony, none of them daring to approach any closer
than Hermione had.</p>
<p>"What can we do?" said Dean in a trembling voice.</p>
<p>"Back off and give him more space -" said the dry voice of
Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>"No!" interrupted the Headmaster. "Let him be surrounded by his
friends."</p>
<p>Harry swallowed his chocolate, and said in that empty voice,
"They're stupid. They should die<em>mmmppphhh</em>" as another
piece of chocolate entered his mouth.</p>
<p>Hermione saw the looks of shock that crossed their faces.</p>
<p>"He doesn't mean it, does he?" Seamus said it like he was
begging.</p>
<p>"You don't understand," Hermione said, her voice breaking,
"<em>that's not Harry -</em>" and she shut up before she said
anything more, but she <em>had</em> to say that much.</p>
<p>She saw from the look on his face that Neville understood, and
she also saw that the others didn't. If Harry had really never
thought anything like that, then being exposed to a Dementor for
less than a minute wouldn't have made him say it. That's what they
were probably thinking.</p>
<p>Less than a minute of Dementor exposure couldn't create a whole
new evil person inside you out of nothing.</p>
<p>But if that person was <em>already there</em> -</p>
<p><em>Does the Headmaster know?</em></p>
<p>Hermione looked up at the Headmaster, and found that Albus
Dumbledore was gazing at <em>her</em>, and that his blue eyes had
grown suddenly piercing -</p>
<p>Words came into her mind.</p>
<p><em>Do not speak of it,</em> said the will of Dumbledore to
her.</p>
<p><em>You know,</em> thought Hermione. <em>About his dark
side.</em></p>
<p><em>I know. But this is beyond even that. Fawkes's song cannot
reach him, where he is lost.</em></p>
<p><em>What can we -</em></p>
<p><em>I have a plan,</em> sent the Headmaster.
<em>Patience.</em></p>
<p>Something about the tenor of that thought made Hermione nervous.
<em>What sort of plan?</em></p>
<p><em>It is better that you not know,</em> sent the
Headmaster.</p>
<p>Now Hermione was getting <em>really</em> nervous. She didn't
know how <em>much</em> the Headmaster knew about Harry's dark side
-</p>
<p><em>A fair point,</em> sent the Headmaster. <em>I am about to
tell you; steel yourself so as not to react. Are you ready? Good. I
am going to pretend to cast the Killing Curse on Professor
McGonagall - DO NOT REACT, Hermione!</em></p>
<p>That took work. The Headmaster really was crazy! That wouldn't
bring Harry <em>out</em> of his dark side, Harry would go
<em>completely berserk</em>, he'd <em>kill</em> the Headmaster
-</p>
<p><em>But that is not true darkness,</em> sent Albus Dumbledore.
<em>That is protectiveness, that is love. Fawkes will be able to
reach him, then. And when Harry sees that Minerva is alive after
all, it will return him fully.</em></p>
<p>The thought came to Hermione -</p>
<p><em>I doubt that will work,</em> sent the Headmaster, <em>and
you may not like the way he reacts if you try. But you may try if
you wish.</em></p>
<p>She hadn't really meant that seriously! It was too -</p>
<p>Then her eyes moved, breaking gaze with the Headmaster, going to
the boy looking around with empty, despising eyes as his mouth kept
chewing and swallowing bar after bar of chocolate without effect.
Her heart wrenched, and suddenly a lot of things didn't seem to
matter, only that there was a chance.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>There was a compulsion to chew and swallow chocolate. The
response to compulsion was killing.</p>
<p>People had gathered around and stared. That was annoying. The
response to annoyance was killing.</p>
<p>Other people were chattering in the background. That was
insolent. The response to insolence was to inflict pain, but since
none of them were useful, killing them would be simpler.</p>
<p>Killing all those people would be difficult. But many of them
didn't trust Quirrell, who was strong. Finding exactly the right
trigger could cause them all to kill each other.</p>
<p>Then a person leaned over into the field of vision and did
something completely strange, something that belonged to a foreign
mode of thought, for which there was only a single response stored
anywhere -</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>She heard the gasps around her, and they didn't matter, she
maintained the kiss on those chocolate-smeared lips as the tears
welled in her eyes.</p>
<p>And Harry's arms came up and pushed her away, and his lips
yelled, "<em>I told you, no kissing!</em> "</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"I think he'll be all right now," the Headmaster said, looking
at where Harry was crying in great wretched sobs as Fawkes crooned
over him. "Excellently done, Miss Granger. Do you know, not even I
would have expected that to actually work?"</p>
<p>The phoenix's song wasn't meant for her, Hermione knew, but she
could still be soothed by it, which she needed, because her life
was officially over.</p>
</div>
<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 45: Humanism, Pt 3<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>Fawkes's song gently trailed off into nothing.</p>
<p>Harry sat up from where he had lain on the winter-blasted grass,
Fawkes still perched on his shoulder.</p>
<p>There were intakes of breath from all around him.</p>
<p>"Harry," said Seamus in a wavering voice, "are you all
right?"</p>
<p>The peace of the phoenix was still in him, and warmth, from
where Fawkes perched. Warmth, spreading out through him, and the
memory of the song, still alive in the phoenix's presence. There
were terrible things that had happened to him, terrible thoughts
that had passed through him. He had regained an impossible memory,
for all that the Dementor had made him desecrate it. A strange word
kept echoing in his mind. And all of that could be put on hold for
later, while the phoenix still shone red and gold beneath the
setting sun.</p>
<p>Fawkes cawed at him.</p>
<p>"Something I have to do?" Harry said to Fawkes. "What?"</p>
<p>Fawkes bobbed its head in the direction of the Dementor.</p>
<p>Harry looked at the unseeable horror still in its cage, then
back at the phoenix, puzzled.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter?" said Minerva McGonagall's voice from behind him.
"<em>Are</em> you all right?"</p>
<p>Harry climbed to his feet and turned.</p>
<p>Minerva McGonagall was looking at him, looking very worried;
Albus Dumbledore beside her was studying him carefully; Filius
Flitwick appeared tremendously relieved; and all the students were
just plain staring.</p>
<p>"I think so, Professor McGonagall," Harry said calmly. He'd
almost said <em>Minerva</em> before managing to stop himself. While
Fawkes was on his shoulder, at least, Harry was fine; it might be
that he would collapse a moment after Fawkes left, but somehow
thoughts like that didn't seem important. "I think I'm okay."</p>
<p>There ought to have been cheering, or sighs of relief, or
something, but no one seemed to know what to say, no one at
all.</p>
<p>The peace of the phoenix lingered.</p>
<p>Harry turned back. "Hermione?" he said.</p>
<p>Everyone with the tiniest smidgin of romance in their hearts
held their breath.</p>
<p>"I don't really know how to say thank you graciously," Harry
said quietly, "any more than I know how to apologize. All I can say
that if you're wondering whether it was the right thing to do, it
was."</p>
<p>The boy and the girl gazed into each other's eyes.</p>
<p>"Sorry," Harry said. "About what happens next. If there's
anything I can do -"</p>
<p>"No," Hermione said back. "There isn't. It's all right, though."
Then she turned from Harry and walked away, toward the path that
led back to the gates of Hogwarts.</p>
<p>A number of girls gave Harry puzzled looks, and then followed
her. As they went, you could hear the excited questions
starting.</p>
<p>Harry looked at them as they left, turned back to look at the
other students. They'd seen him on the ground, screaming,
and...</p>
<p>Fawkes nuzzled his cheek, briefly.</p>
<p>...and that would help them, someday, understanding that the
Boy-Who-Lived could also be hurt, could be wretched. So that when
they were hurt and wretched themselves, they would remember seeing
Harry writhing on the ground, and know that their own pain and
troubles didn't mean they'd never amount to anything. Had the
Headmaster calculated that, when he had let the other students stay
and watch?</p>
<p>Harry's eyes went back to the tall tattered cloak, almost
absentmindedly, and without really being aware of what he was
speaking, Harry said, "It shouldn't ought to exist."</p>
<p>"Ah," said a dry, precise voice. "I thought you might say that.
I am very sorry to tell you, Mr. Potter, that Dementors cannot be
killed. Many have tried."</p>
<p>"Really?" Harry said, still absentmindedly. "What did they
try?"</p>
<p>"There is a certain extremely dangerous and destructive spell,"
Professor Quirrell said, "which I will not name here; a spell of
cursed fire. It is what you would use to destroy an ancient device
such as the Sorting Hat. It has no effect on Dementors. They are
undying."</p>
<p>"They are not undying," said the Headmaster. The words mild, the
gaze sharp. "They do not possess eternal life. They are wounds in
the world, and attacking a wound only makes it larger."</p>
<p>"Hm," Harry said. "Suppose you threw it into the Sun? Would it
be destroyed?"</p>
<p>"<em>Throw</em> it into the <em>Sun?</em> " squeaked Professor
Flitwick, looking like he wanted to faint.</p>
<p>"It seems unlikely, Mr. Potter," Professor Quirrell said dryly.
"The Sun is very large, after all; I doubt the Dementor would have
much effect on it. But it is not a test I would like to try, Mr.
Potter, just in case."</p>
<p>"I see," Harry said.</p>
<p>Fawkes cawed a final time, mantled his wings around Harry's
head, and then launched himself from Harry. Launched himself
straight toward the Dementor, screaming a great piercing cry of
defiance that echoed around the field. And before anyone could
react to that, there was a flash of fire, and Fawkes was gone.</p>
<p>The peace faded, a little.</p>
<p>The warmth faded, a little.</p>
<p>Harry took in a deep breath, let it out again.</p>
<p>"Yep," Harry said. "Still alive."</p>
<p>Again that silence, again the absence of cheering; no one seemed
to know how to respond -</p>
<p>"It is good to know you are fully recovered, Mr. Potter,"
Professor Quirrell said firmly, as though to deny any other
possibility. "Now, I believe Miss Ransom was up next?"</p>
<p>That started a bit of an argument, in which Professor Quirrell
was right and everyone else was wrong. The Defense Professor
pointed out that, despite the understandable emotions of all
concerned, the chance of a similar mishap occurring to any other
student verged on the infinitesimal; the more so as they now knew
to avoid mischances with wands. And meanwhile, there were other
students who needed to take their own best chance at casting a
corporeal Patronus Charm, or else learn the feeling of a Dementor
so they could flee, and discover their own degree of
vulnerability...</p>
<p>In the end it turned out that Dean Thomas and Ron Weasley of
Gryffindor were the only ones left who were still willing to go
anywhere near the Dementor, which simplified the argument.</p>
<p>Harry glanced in the Dementor's direction. The word echoed in
his mind again.</p>
<p><em>All right,</em> Harry thought to himself, <em>if the
Dementor is a riddle, what is the answer?</em></p>
<p>And just like that, it was obvious.</p>
<p>Harry looked at the tarnished, slightly corroded cage.</p>
<p>He saw what lay beneath the tall, tattered cloak.</p>
<p>That was it, then.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall came and spoke to Harry. She hadn't seen
the worst of it, so there was only a slight glitter of water in her
eyes. Harry told her that he needed to talk to her afterward and
ask a question he'd put off for a while, but that didn't need to
happen right now, if she was busy. There was a certain look about
her which suggested that she had been pulled away from something
important; and Harry observed this to her, and said that she
honestly didn't need to feel guilty about leaving. This earned him
something of a sharp look, but then leave she did, hurriedly, with
a promise that they would talk later.</p>
<p>Dean Thomas cast his white bear again, even in the Dementor's
presence; and Ron Weasley put up an adequate shield of sparkling
mist. Which concluded the day, so far as everyone else was
concerned, and Professor Flitwick began to herd the students back
to Hogwarts. When it was clear that Harry meant to stay behind,
Professor Flitwick looked at him quizzically; and Harry, for his
part, glanced significantly at Dumbledore. Harry didn't know what
Professor Flitwick made of that, but after a sharp gaze of warning,
his Head of House departed.</p>
<p>And so remained only Harry, Professor Quirrell, Headmaster
Dumbledore, and an Auror trio.</p>
<p>It would have been better to get rid of the trio first, but
Harry couldn't think of a good way to do that.</p>
<p>"All right," said Auror Komodo, "let's take it back."</p>
<p>"Excuse me," Harry said. "I'd like to have another go at the
Dementor."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry's request met with a certain amount of opposition of the
<em>you're completely insane</em> variety, though it was only Auror
Butnaru who actually said that out loud.</p>
<p>"Fawkes told me to," Harry said.</p>
<p>This did not overcome all the opposition, despite the look of
shock it produced on Dumbledore's face. The argument went on, and
it was starting to wear the edges off the phoenix's remaining
peace, which annoyed Harry, though only a little.</p>
<p>"Look," Harry said, "I'm pretty sure I know what I was doing
wrong before. There's a kind of person who has to use a different
sort of warm and happy thought. Just let me try it, okay?"</p>
<p>This did not prove persuasive either.</p>
<p>"I think," Professor Quirrell said finally, staring at Harry
with narrowed eyes, "that if we do not allow him to do this under
supervision, he may, at some point or another, sneak off and look
for a Dementor on his own. Do I accuse you falsely, Mr.
Potter?"</p>
<p>There was an appalled pause at this. It seemed like a good time
to play his trump card.</p>
<p>"I don't mind if the Headmaster keeps his own Patronus up,"
Harry said. <em>For I will be in the presence of a Dementor just
the same, Patronus or no.</em></p>
<p>There was confusion at this, even Professor Quirrell looked
puzzled; but the Headmaster finally acceded, since it didn't seem
likely that Harry could be hurt through four Patronuses.</p>
<p><em>If the Dementor could not reach through your Patronus on
some level, Albus Dumbledore, you would not see a naked man painful
to look upon...</em></p>
<p>Harry didn't say it out loud, for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>And they began to walk toward the Dementor.</p>
<p>"Headmaster," Harry said, "suppose the Ravenclaw door asked you
this riddle: What lies at the center of a Dementor? What would you
say?"</p>
<p>"Fear," said the Headmaster.</p>
<p>It was a simple enough mistake. The Dementor approached, and the
fear came over you. The fear hurt, you felt the fear weakening you,
you wanted the fear to go away.</p>
<p>It was natural to think the fear was the problem.</p>
<p>So they'd concluded that the Dementor was a creature of pure
fear, that there was nothing there to fear but fear itself, that
the Dementor couldn't hurt you if you weren't afraid...</p>
<p>But...</p>
<p><em>What lies at the center of a Dementor?</em></p>
<p><em>Fear.</em></p>
<p><em>What is so horrible that the mind refuses to see
it?</em></p>
<p><em>Fear.</em></p>
<p><em>What is impossible to kill?</em></p>
<p><em>Fear.</em></p>
<p>...it didn't quite fit, once you thought about it.</p>
<p>Though it was clear enough why people would be reluctant to look
beyond the first answer.</p>
<p>People <em>understood</em> fear.</p>
<p>People knew what they were supposed to <em>do</em> about
fear.</p>
<p>So, faced with a Dementor, it wouldn't exactly be comforting to
ask: 'What if the fear is just a side effect rather than the main
problem?'</p>
<p>They had come very close to the Dementor's cage guarded by four
Patronuses, when there came sharp intakes of breath from the three
Aurors and Professor Quirrell. Everyone's faces turned to look at
the Dementor, seeming to listen; there was horror on Auror
Goryanof's face.</p>
<p>Then Professor Quirrell raised his head, his face hard, and spat
toward the Dementor.</p>
<p>"It did not like having its prey taken from it, I suppose,"
Dumbledore said quietly. "Well. If it becomes necessary, Quirinus,
there will always be a refuge for you at Hogwarts."</p>
<p>"What did it say?" said Harry.</p>
<p>Every head swung to stare at him.</p>
<p>"You didn't hear it...?" Dumbledore said.</p>
<p>Harry shook his head.</p>
<p>"It said to me," said Professor Quirrell, "that it knew me, and
that it would hunt me down someday, wherever I tried to hide." His
face was rigid, showing no fright.</p>
<p>"Ah," Harry said. "I wouldn't worry about that, Professor
Quirrell." <em>It's not like Dementors can actually talk, or think;
the structure they have is borrowed from your own mind and
expectations...</em></p>
<p>Now everyone was giving him <em>very</em> strange looks. The
Aurors were glancing nervously at each other, at the Dementor, at
Harry.</p>
<p>And they stood directly before the Dementor's cage.</p>
<p>"They are wounds in the world," Harry said. "It's just a wild
guess, but I'm guessing the one who said that was Godric
Gryffindor."</p>
<p>"Yes..." said Dumbledore. "How did you know?"</p>
<p><em>It is a common misconception</em>, thought Harry, <em>that
all the best rationalists are Sorted into Ravenclaw, leaving none
for other Houses. This is not so; being Sorted into Ravenclaw
indicates that your strongest virtue is curiosity, wondering and
desiring to know the true answer. And this is not the</em> only
<em>virtue a rationalist needs. Sometimes you have to work hard on
a problem, and stick to it for a while. Sometimes you need a clever
plan for finding out. And sometimes what you need more than
anything else to see an answer, is the courage to face
it...</em></p>
<p>Harry's gaze went to what lay beneath the cloak, the horror far
worse than any decaying mummy. Rowena Ravenclaw might also have
known, for it was an obvious enough riddle once you saw it as a
riddle.</p>
<p>And it was also obvious why the Patronuses were animals. The
animals didn't know, and so were sheltered from the fear.</p>
<p>But Harry knew, and would always know, and would never be able
to forget. He'd tried to teach himself to face reality without
flinching, and though Harry had not yet mastered that art, still
those grooves had been worn into his mind, the learned reflex to
look <em>toward</em> the painful thought instead of away. Harry
would never be able to forget by thinking warm happy thoughts about
something else, and that was why the spell hadn't worked for
him.</p>
<p>So Harry would think a warm happy thought that <em>wasn't</em>
about something else.</p>
<p>Harry drew forth his wand that Professor Flitwick had returned
to him, put his feet into the beginning stance for the Patronus
Charm.</p>
<p>Within his mind, Harry discarded the last remnants of the peace
of the phoenix, put aside the calm, the dreamlike state, remembered
instead Fawkes's piercing cry, and roused himself for battle.
Called upon all the pieces and elements of himself to awaken.
Raised up within himself all the strength that the Patronus Charm
could ever draw upon, to put himself into the right frame of mind
for the final warm and happy thought; remembered all bright
things.</p>
<p>The books his father had bought him.</p>
<p>Mum's smile when Harry had handmade her a mother's day card, an
elaborate thing that had used half a pound of spare electronics
parts from the garage to flash lights and beep a little tune, and
had taken him three days to make.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall telling him that his parents had died well,
protecting him. As they had.</p>
<p>Realizing that Hermione was keeping up with him and even running
faster, that they could be true rivals and friends.</p>
<p>Coaxing Draco out of the darkness, watching him slowly move
toward the light.</p>
<p>Neville and Seamus and Lavender and Dean and everyone else who
looked up to him, everyone that he would have fought to protect if
anything threatened Hogwarts.</p>
<p>Everything that made life worth living.</p>
<p>His wand rose into the starting position for the Patronus
Charm.</p>
<p>Harry thought of the stars, the image that had almost held off
the Dementor even without a Patronus. Only this time, Harry added
the missing ingredient, he'd never truly seen it but he'd seen the
pictures and the video. The Earth, blazing blue and white with
reflected sunlight as it hung in space, amid the black void and the
brilliant points of light. It belonged there, within that image,
because it was what gave everything else its meaning. The Earth was
what made the stars significant, made them more than uncontrolled
fusion reactions, because it was Earth that would someday colonize
the galaxy, and fulfill the promise of the night sky.</p>
<p>Would they still be plagued by Dementors, the children's
children's children, the distant descendants of humankind as they
strode from star to star? No. Of course not. The Dementors were
only little nuisances, paling into nothingness in the light of that
promise; not unkillable, not invincible, not even close. You had to
put up with little nuisances, if you were one of the lucky and
unlucky few to be born on Earth; on Ancient Earth, as it would be
remembered someday. That too was part of what it meant to be alive,
if you were one of the tiny handful of sentient beings born into
the beginning of all things, before intelligent life had come fully
into its power. That the much vaster future depended on what you
did here, now, in the earliest days of dawn, when there was still
so much darkness to be fought, and temporary nuisances like
Dementors.</p>
<p>Mum and Dad, Hermione's friendship and Draco's journey, Neville
and Seamus and Lavender and Dean, the blue sky and brilliant Sun
and all bright things, the Earth, the stars, the promise,
everything humanity was and everything it would become...</p>
<p>On the wand, Harry's fingers moved into their starting
positions; he was ready, now, to think the right sort of warm and
happy thought.</p>
<p>And Harry's eyes stared directly at that which lay beneath the
tattered cloak, looked straight at that which had been named
Dementor. The void, the emptiness, the hole in the universe, the
absence of color and space, the open drain through which warmth
poured out of the world.</p>
<p>The fear it exuded stole away all happy thoughts, its closeness
drained your power and strength, its kiss would destroy everything
that you were.</p>
<p><em>I know you now</em>, Harry thought as his wand twitched
once, twice, thrice and four times, as his fingers slid exactly the
right distances, <em>I comprehend your nature, you symbolize Death,
through some law of magic you are a shadow that Death casts into
the world.</em></p>
<p><em>And Death is not something I will ever embrace.</em></p>
<p><em>It is only a childish thing, that the human species has not
yet outgrown.</em></p>
<p><em>And someday...</em></p>
<p><em>We'll get over it...</em></p>
<p><em>And people won't have to say goodbye any more...</em></p>
<p>The wand rose up and leveled straight at the Dementor.</p>
<p><em>"EXPECTO PATRONUM!"</em></p>
<p>The thought exploded from him like a breaking dam, surged down
his arm into his wand, burst from it as blazing white light. Light
that became corporeal, took on shape and substance.</p>
<p>A figure with two arms, two legs, and a head, standing upright;
the animal <em>Homo sapiens,</em> the shape of a human being.</p>
<p>Glowing brighter and brighter as Harry poured all his strength
into his spell, blazing with incandescent light brighter than the
fading sunset, the Aurors and Professor Quirrell shielding their
eyes in shock -</p>
<p><em>And someday when the descendants of humanity have spread
from star to star, they won't tell the children about the history
of Ancient Earth until they're old enough to bear it; and when they
learn they'll weep to hear that such a thing as Death had ever once
existed!</em></p>
<p>The figure of a human shone more brilliant now than the noonday
Sun, so radiant that Harry could feel the warmth of it on his skin;
and Harry sent out all his defiance at the shadow of Death, opening
all the floodgates inside him to make that bright shape blaze even
brighter and yet brighter.</p>
<p><em>You are not invincible, and someday the human species will
end you.</em></p>
<p><em>I will end you if I can, by the power of mind and magic and
science.</em></p>
<p><em>I won't cower in fear of Death, not while I have a chance of
winning.</em></p>
<p><em>I won't let Death touch me, I won't let Death touch the ones
I love.</em></p>
<p><em>And even if you do end me before I end you,</em></p>
<p><em>Another will take my place, and another,</em></p>
<p><em>Until the wound in the world is healed at last...</em></p>
<p>Harry lowered his wand, and the bright figure of a human faded
away.</p>
<p>Slowly, he exhaled.</p>
<p>Like waking up from a dream, like opening his eyes after sleep,
Harry's gaze moved away from the cage, he looked around and saw
that everyone was staring at him.</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore was staring at him.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was staring at him.</p>
<p>The Auror trio was staring at him.</p>
<p>They were all looking at him like they'd just seen him destroy a
Dementor.</p>
<p>The tattered cloak lay empty within the cage.</p>
</div>
<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 46: Humanism, Pt 4<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>The last tip of the Sun was sinking below the horizon, the red
light fading from the treetops, only the blue sky illuminating the
six people standing upon the winter-dried and snow-spotted grass,
near a vacant cage on whose floor lay an empty, tattered cloak.</p>
<p>Harry felt... well, <em>normal</em> again. Sane-ish. The spell
hadn't undone the day and its damage, hadn't made the injuries as
if they had never been, but his hurts had been... bandaged,
meliorated? It was hard to describe.</p>
<p>Dumbledore was also looking healthier, though not fully
restored. The old wizard's head turned for a moment, locked eyes
with Professor Quirrell, then looked back to Harry. "Harry,"
Dumbledore said, "are you about to collapse in exhaustion and
possibly die?"</p>
<p>"No, strangely enough," Harry said. "That took something out of
me, but a lot less than I thought it would." <em>Or maybe it gave
something back, as well as taking...</em> "Honestly, I expected my
body to be hitting the ground with a thud about now."</p>
<p>There was a distinct body-hitting-the-ground-with-a-thuddish
sort of sound.</p>
<p>"Thank you for taking care of that, Quirinus," said Dumbledore
to Professor Quirrell, who was now standing above and behind the
unconscious forms of the three Aurors. "I confess I am still
feeling a bit peaky. Though I shall handle the Memory Charms
myself."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell inclined his head, and then looked at Harry.
"I will omit a good deal of useless incredulity," said Professor
Quirrell, "remarks to the effect that Merlin himself failed to do
that, et cetera. Let us go straight to asking the important
question. What the sweet slithering snakes was <em>that?</em> "</p>
<p>"The Patronus Charm," Harry said. "Version 2.0."</p>
<p>"I rejoice to see that you are your usual self again," said
Dumbledore. "But you are not going <em>anywhere</em>, young
Ravenclaw, until you tell me what exactly was that warm and happy
thought."</p>
<p>"Hm..." said Harry. He tapped a contemplative finger on his
cheek. "I wonder if I should?"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell suddenly grinned.</p>
<p>"Please?" said the Headmaster. "Pretty please with sugar on
top?"</p>
<p>Harry felt an impulse and decided to go with it. It was
dangerous, but there might not ever be a better opportunity until
the end of time.</p>
<p>"Three sodas," Harry said to his pouch, then looked up at the
Defense Professor and the Headmaster of Hogwarts. "Gentlemen,"
Harry said, "I bought these sodas on my first visit to Platform
Nine and Three-Quarters, on the day I entered into Hogwarts. I have
been saving them for special occasions; there is a minor
enchantment on them to ensure they are drunk at the right time.
This is the last of my supply, but I do not think there will ever
come a finer occasion. Shall we?"</p>
<p>Dumbledore took a soda can from Harry, and Harry tossed another
to Professor Quirrell. The two older men each muttered identical
charms over the can and frowned briefly at the result. Harry, for
his part, simply popped the top and drank.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor and the Headmaster of Hogwarts politely
followed suit.</p>
<p>Harry said, "I thought of my absolute rejection of death as the
natural order."</p>
<p>It might not be the right kind of warm feeling you needed to
cast a Patronus Charm, but it was going into Harry's Top 10
nonetheless.</p>
<p>The looks he got from the Defense Professor and the Headmaster
briefly made Harry nervous, as the spilled Comed-Tea faded out of
existence; but then the two of them each glanced at the other and
both apparently decided that they couldn't get away with doing
anything really awful to Harry in the other's presence.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter," said Professor Quirrell, "even <em>I</em> know
that is not how things are supposed to work."</p>
<p>"Indeed," said Dumbledore. "Explain."</p>
<p>Harry opened his mouth, and then, as realization hit him,
rapidly snapped his mouth shut again. Godric hadn't told anyone,
nor had Rowena if she'd known; there might have been any number of
wizards who'd figured it out and kept their mouths shut. You
couldn't forget if you <em>knew</em> that was what you were trying
to do; once you realized <em>how</em> it worked, the animal form of
the Patronus Charm would never work for you again - and most
wizards didn't have the right upbringing to turn on Dementors and
destroy them -</p>
<p>"Erm, sorry about this," said Harry. "But I've just this instant
realized that explaining would be an <em>incredibly</em> bad idea
until you work some things out on your own."</p>
<p>"Is that the truth, Harry?" Dumbledore said slowly. "Or are you
just pretending to be wise -"</p>
<p>"<em>Headmaster!</em> " said Professor Quirrell, sounding
genuinely shocked. "Mr. Potter has told you that this spell is not
spoken of with those who cannot cast it! You do not press a wizard
on such matters!"</p>
<p>"If I told you -" Harry began.</p>
<p>"No," Professor Quirrell said, sounding rather severe. "You
don't tell us <em>why,</em> Mr. Potter, you simply tell us that we
are not to know. If you wish to devise a hint, you do so carefully,
at leisure, not in the midst of conversation."</p>
<p>Harry nodded.</p>
<p>"But," said the Headmaster. "But, but what am I to tell the
Ministry? You can't just <em>lose</em> a Dementor!"</p>
<p>"Tell them I ate it," said Professor Quirrell, causing Harry to
choke on the soda he had unthinkingly raised to his lips. "I don't
mind. Shall we head on back, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>The two of them began to walk the dirt path back to Hogwarts,
leaving behind Albus Dumbledore staring forlornly at the empty cage
and the three sleeping Aurors awaiting their Memory Charms.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Aftermath, Harry Potter and Professor Quirrell:</em></p>
<p>They walked for a while before Professor Quirrell spoke, and all
background noise dropped into silence when he did.</p>
<p>"You are exceptionally good at killing things, my student," said
Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>"Thank you," Harry said sincerely.</p>
<p>"I am not prying," said Professor Quirrell, "but on the
off-chance that it was <em>only</em> the Headmaster who you did not
trust with the secret...?"</p>
<p>Harry considered this. Professor Quirrell already couldn't cast
the animal Patronus Charm.</p>
<p>But you couldn't untell a secret, and Harry was a fast enough
learner to realize that he ought to at least <em>think</em> for a
while before unleashing this one upon the world.</p>
<p>Harry shook his head, and Professor Quirrell nodded
acceptance.</p>
<p>"Out of curiosity, Professor Quirrell," said Harry, "if your
bringing the Dementor to Hogwarts had been part of an evil plot,
what would have been its goal?"</p>
<p>"Assassinate Dumbledore while he was weakened," Professor
Quirrell said without even hesitating. "Hm. The Headmaster told you
he was suspicious of me?"</p>
<p>Harry said nothing for a second while he tried to think of a
reply, and then gave up when he realized he'd already answered.</p>
<p>"Interesting..." Professor Quirrell said. "Mr. Potter, it is not
out of the question that there <em>was</em> a plot at work today.
Your wand ending up that close to the Dementor's cage
<em>could</em> have been an accident. Or one of the Aurors could
have been Imperiused, Confunded, or Legilimized to exert an
influence. Flitwick and myself should not be excluded as suspects,
in your calculation. One notes that Professor Snape canceled all
his classes today, and I suspect he is powerful enough to
Disillusion himself; the Aurors cast detection charms early on, but
they did not repeat them immediately before your turn. But most
easily of all, Mr. Potter, the deed could have been plotted by
Dumbledore himself; and if he <em>did</em>, why, he might also take
steps in advance to cast your suspicion elsewhere."</p>
<p>They walked on for a few steps.</p>
<p>"But why <em>would</em> he?" Harry said.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor stayed quiet a moment, and then said, "Mr.
Potter, what steps have you taken to investigate the Headmaster's
character?"</p>
<p>"Not many," said Harry. He'd only recently realized... "Not
nearly enough."</p>
<p>"Then I will observe," said Professor Quirrell, "that you do not
find out all there is to know about a man by asking only his
friends."</p>
<p>Now it was Harry's turn to walk a few steps in silence on the
slightly beaten dirt path that led back to Hogwarts. He'd really
been supposed to know better than that already. Confirmation bias
was the technical term; it meant, among other things, that when you
chose your information sources, there was a notable tendency to
choose information sources that agreed with your current
opinions.</p>
<p>"Thank you," Harry said. "Actually... I didn't say it earlier,
did I? Thank you for <em>everything</em>. If another Dementor ever
threatens you, or for that matter, slightly annoys you, just let me
know and I'll introduce it to Mister Glowy Person. I don't like it
when Dementors slightly annoy my friends."</p>
<p>That got him an indecipherable glance from Professor Quirrell.
"You destroyed the Dementor because it threatened me?"</p>
<p>"Erm," Harry said, "I'd sort of decided on it before then, but
yes, that would have been sufficient reason by itself."</p>
<p>"I see," said Professor Quirrell. "And what would you have done
about the threat to me if your spell <em>hadn't</em> worked for
destroying the Dementor?"</p>
<p>"Plan B," said Harry. "Encase the Dementor in dense metal with a
high melting point, probably tungsten, drop it into an active
volcano, and hope it ends up inside Earth's mantle. Ah, the whole
planet is filled with molten lava under its surface -"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Professor Quirrell. "I know." The Defense Professor
was wearing a very odd smile. "I really should have thought of that
myself, all things considered. Tell me, Mr. Potter, if you wanted
to lose something where no one would ever find it again, where
would you put it?"</p>
<p>Harry considered this question. "I suppose I shouldn't ask
<em>what</em> you've found that needs losing -"</p>
<p>"Quite," said Professor Quirrell, as Harry had expected; and
then, "Perhaps you will be told when you are older," which Harry
hadn't.</p>
<p>"Well," said Harry, "besides trying to get it into the molten
core of the planet, you could bury it in solid rock a kilometer
underground in a randomly selected location - maybe teleport it in,
if there's some way to do that blindly, or drill a hole and repair
the hole afterward; the important thing would be not to leave any
traces leading there, so it's just an anonymous cubic meter
somewhere in the Earth's crust. You could drop it into the Mariana
Trench, that's the deepest depth of ocean on the planet - or just
pick some random other ocean trench, to make it less obvious. If
you could make it buoyant and invisible, then you could throw it
into the stratosphere. Or ideally you would launch it into space,
with a cloak against detection, and a randomly fluctuating
acceleration factor that would take it out of the Solar System. And
afterward, of course, you'd Obliviate yourself, so even you didn't
know exactly where it was."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor was laughing, and it sounded even odder
than his smile.</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell?" Harry said.</p>
<p>"All excellent suggestions," said Professor Quirrell. "But tell
me, Mr. Potter, why those exact five?"</p>
<p>"Huh?" said Harry. "They just seemed like the obvious sorts of
ideas."</p>
<p>"Oh?" said Professor Quirrell. "But there is an interesting
pattern to them, you see. One might say it sounds like something of
a riddle. I must admit, Mr. Potter, that although it has had its
ups and downs, on the whole, this has been a surprisingly good
day."</p>
<p>And they continued walking down the path that led to the gates
of Hogwarts, quite some distance apart; as Harry, without even
thinking about it, automatically stayed far enough away from the
Defense Professor not to trigger that sense of doom, which for some
reason seemed unusually strong right now.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Aftermath, Daphne Greengrass:</em></p>
<p>Hermione had refused to answer any questions, and as soon as
they'd passed the split leading to the Slytherin dungeons, Daphne
and Tracey had peeled off at once, walking as quickly as they
could. Rumor traveled fast in Hogwarts, so they'd have to go to the
dungeons right away if they wanted to be the first to tell everyone
the story.</p>
<p>"Now remember," said Daphne, "don't just blurt out about the
kiss as soon as we walk in, okay? It works better if we tell the
whole story in order."</p>
<p>Tracey nodded excitedly.</p>
<p>And as soon as they burst into the Slytherin common room, Tracey
Davis took a deep breath and shouted, "<em>Everyone! Harry Potter
couldn't cast the Patronus Charm and the Dementor almost ate him
and Professor Quirrell saved him but then Potter was all evil until
Granger brought him back with a kiss! It's true love for
sure!</em> "</p>
<p>It was ordered storytelling of a sort, Daphne supposed.</p>
<p>The news failed to produce the expected reaction. Most of the
girls glanced over and then stayed in their couches, or the boys
simply kept reading in their chairs.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Pansy sourly, from where she was sitting with
Gregory's feet in her lap, leaning back and reading what seemed to
be a coloring book, "Millicent already told us."</p>
<p><em>How -</em></p>
<p>"Why didn't <em>you</em> kiss him first, Tracey?" said Flora and
Hestia Carrow from their own chairs. "Now Potter's going to marry a
mudblood girl! <em>You</em> could've been his true love and gotten
into a rich Noble House and everything if you'd just kissed him
first!"</p>
<p>Tracey's face was a picture in stunned realization.</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " shrieked Daphne. "Love does not work like
that!"</p>
<p>"Of course it does," stated Millicent from where she was
practicing some sort of Charm while looking out a window at the
swirling waters of the Hogwarts Lake. "First kiss gets the
prince."</p>
<p>"<em>It wasn't their first kiss!</em> " shouted Daphne.
"Hermione was <em>already</em> his true love! That's why
<em>she</em> could bring him back!" Then Daphne realized what she'd
just said and winced internally, but as the saying went, you had to
fit the tongue to the ear.</p>
<p>"Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?" said Gregory, swinging his feet off
Pansy's lap. "What's this? Miss Bulstrode didn't tell that
part."</p>
<p>Everyone else was also looking at Daphne, now.</p>
<p>"Oh, yeah," said Daphne, "Harry shoved her away and shouted, 'I
told you, no kissing!' Then Harry screamed like he was dying and
Fawkes started singing to him - I'm not sure which one of those
happened first, actually -"</p>
<p>"That doesn't sound like true love to <em>me,</em>" said the
Carrow twins. "That sounds like the <em>wrong person</em> kissed
him."</p>
<p>"It was supposed to be <em>me</em>," whispered Tracey. Her face
was still stunned. "<em>I</em> was supposed to be his true love.
Harry Potter was <em>my</em> general. I should've, I should've
fought Granger for him -"</p>
<p>Daphne spun on Tracey, incensed. "<em>You?</em> Take Harry away
from Hermione?"</p>
<p>"Yeah!" said Tracey. "Me!"</p>
<p>"You're nuts," Daphne stated with conviction. "Even if you
<em>had</em> kissed him first, you know what that would make you?
The sad little lovestruck girl who dies at the end of Act Two."</p>
<p>"<em>You take that back!</em> " shouted Tracey.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Gregory had crossed the room to where Vincent was
doing his homework. "Mr. Crabbe," Gregory said in a low voice, "I
think Mr. Malfoy needs to know about this."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Aftermath, Hermione Granger:</em></p>
<p>Hermione stared at the wax-sealed paper, on the surface of which
was inscribed simply the number <em>42.</em></p>
<p><em>I figured out why we couldn't cast the Patronus Charm,
Hermione, it doesn't have anything to do with us not being happy
enough. But I can't tell you. I couldn't even tell the Headmaster.
It needs to be even more secret than partial Transfiguration, for
now, anyway. But if you ever need to fight Dementors, the secret is
written here, cryptically, so that if someone doesn't know it's
about Dementors and the Patronus Charm, they won't know what it
means...</em></p>
<p>She'd told Harry about seeing him dying, her parents dying, all
her friends dying, everyone dying. She hadn't told him about her
terror of dying alone, somehow that was still too painful.</p>
<p>Harry had told her about remembering his parents dying, and that
he'd thought it was funny.</p>
<p><em>There's no light in the place the Dementor takes you,
Hermione. No warmth. No caring. It's somewhere that you can't even
understand happiness. There's pain, and fear, and those can still
drive you. You can hate, and take pleasure in destroying what you
hate. You can laugh, when you see other people hurting. But you
can't ever be happy, you can't even remember what it is that isn't
there anymore... I don't think there's any way I can ever explain
just what you saved me from. I'm usually ashamed to put people to
trouble, I usually can't stand it when people make sacrifices for
me, but this one time I'll say that no matter what it ends up
costing you to have kissed me, don't ever doubt for a second that
it was the right thing to do.</em></p>
<p>Hermione hadn't realized how <em>little</em> the Dementor had
touched her, how small and shallow had been the darkness into which
it had taken her.</p>
<p>She'd seen everyone dying, and that had still been able to
hurt.</p>
<p>Hermione put the paper back into her pouch, like a good girl
ought to.</p>
<p>She'd really wanted to read it, though.</p>
<p>She was frightened of Dementors.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Aftermath, Minerva McGonagall:</em></p>
<p>She felt frozen; she shouldn't have been so shocked, she
shouldn't have found Harry so hard to face, but after what he'd
been through... She had searched the young boy in front of her for
any signs of Dementation, and failed to find them. But something
about the calm with which he had asked such a foreboding question
seemed deeply worrying. "Mr. Potter, I can't possibly speak of such
matters without the Headmaster's permission!"</p>
<p>The boy in her office took this in without changing expression.
"I would prefer not to disturb the Headmaster over this matter,"
Harry Potter said calmly. "I <em>insist</em> on not disturbing him,
in fact, and you did promise that our conversation would be kept
private. So let me put it this way. I know that there was, in fact,
a prophecy. I know that you are the one who originally heard it
from Professor Trelawney. I know that the prophecy identified the
child of James and Lily as someone dangerous to the Dark Lord. And
I know who I am, indeed everyone now knows who I am, so you are
revealing nothing new or dangerous, if you tell me only this: What
was the <em>exact wording</em> which identified <em>me,</em> the
child of James and Lily?"</p>
<p>Trelawney's hollow voice echoed in her mind -</p>
<p><em>BORN TO THOSE WHO HAVE THRICE DEFIED HIM,<br>
BORN AS THE SEVENTH MONTH DIES...</em></p>
<p>"Harry," said Professor McGonagall, "I can't possibly tell you
that!" It chilled her to the bone that Harry knew so much already,
she couldn't imagine how Harry had learned -</p>
<p>The boy looked at her with strange, sorrowful eyes. "Can you not
sneeze without the Headmaster's permission, Professor McGonagall?
For I do promise to you that I have good reason to ask, and good
reason to keep the question private."</p>
<p>"Please don't, Harry," she whispered.</p>
<p>"All right," Harry said. "One simple question. Please. Was the
Potter family mentioned by <em>name?</em> Does the prophecy
literally say 'Potter'?"</p>
<p>She stared at Harry for a while. She couldn't have said why or
where she got the sense that this was a critical point, that she
could not lightly refuse the request, nor lightly accede to it
-</p>
<p>"No," she finally said. "Please, Harry, don't ask any more."</p>
<p>The boy smiled, a little sadly it seemed, and said, "Thank you,
Minerva. You are a good woman and true."</p>
<p>And while her mouth was still open in utter shock, Harry Potter
got up and left the office; and only then did she realize that
Harry had taken her refusal as an answer, and the true answer at
that -</p>
<p>Harry closed the door behind himself.</p>
<p>The logic had presented itself with a strange diamondlike
clarity. Harry couldn't have said if it had come to him during
Fawkes's singing, or maybe even before.</p>
<p>Lord Voldemort had killed James Potter. He had preferred to
spare Lily Potter's life. He had continued his attack, therefore,
with the sole purpose of killing their infant child.</p>
<p>Dark Lords were not usually scared of infant children.</p>
<p>So there was a prophecy about Harry Potter being dangerous to
Lord Voldemort, and Lord Voldemort had known that prophecy.</p>
<p><em>"I give you this rare chance to flee. But I will not trouble
myself to subdue you, and your death here will not save your child.
Step aside, foolish woman, if you have any sense in you at
all!"</em></p>
<p>Had it been a whim, to give her that chance? But then Lord
Voldemort would not have tried to persuade her. Had the prophecy
warned Lord Voldemort against killing Lily Potter? Then Lord
Voldemort <em>would</em> have troubled himself to subdue her. Lord
Voldemort had been <em>mildly</em> inclined not to kill Lily
Potter. The preference had been stronger than a whim, but not as
strong as a warning.</p>
<p>So suppose that someone whom Lord Voldemort considered a lesser
ally or servant, useful but not indispensable, had begged the Dark
Lord to spare Lily's life. Lily's, but not James's.</p>
<p>This person had known that Lord Voldemort would attack the house
of the Potters. Had known both the prophecy, and the fact that the
Dark Lord knew it. Otherwise he would not have begged Lily's
life.</p>
<p>According to Professor McGonagall, besides herself, the other
two who knew of the prophecy were Albus Dumbledore and Severus
Snape.</p>
<p>Severus Snape, who had loved Lily before she was Lily Potter,
and hated James.</p>
<p>Severus, then, had learned of the prophecy, and told it to the
Dark Lord. Which he had done because the prophecy had not described
the Potters by name. It had been a riddle, and Severus had solved
that riddle only too late.</p>
<p>But if Severus had been the <em>first</em> to hear the prophecy,
and disposed to tell it to the Dark Lord, then why would he also
have told Dumbledore or Professor McGonagall?</p>
<p>Therefore Dumbledore or Professor McGonagall had heard it
first.</p>
<p>The Headmaster of Hogwarts had no obvious reason to tell the
Transfiguration Professor about an extremely sensitive and crucial
prophecy. But the Transfiguration Professor had every reason to
tell the Headmaster.</p>
<p>It seemed likely, then, that Professor McGonagall had been the
first to hear it.</p>
<p>The prior probabilities said that it had been Professor
Trelawney, Hogwarts's resident seer. Seers were rare, so if you
counted up most of the seconds Professor McGonagall had spent in
the presence of a seer over the course of her lifetime, most of
those seer-seconds would be Trelawney-seconds.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall had told Dumbledore, and would have told no
one else about the prophecy without permission.</p>
<p>Therefore, it was Albus Dumbledore who had arranged for Severus
Snape to somehow learn of the prophecy. And Dumbledore himself had
solved the riddle successfully, or he would not have selected
<em>Severus</em>, who had once loved Lily, as the intermediary.</p>
<p>Dumbledore had deliberately arranged for Lord Voldemort to hear
about the prophecy, in hopes of luring him to his death. Perhaps
Dumbledore had arranged for Severus to learn only <em>some</em> of
the prophecy, or there were other prophecies of which Severus had
remained innocent... somehow Dumbledore had known that an
<em>immediate</em> attack on the Potters would still lead to Lord
Voldemort's <em>immediate</em> defeat, although Lord Voldemort
himself had not believed this. Or maybe that had just been a lucky
stroke of Dumbledore's insanity, his taste for bizarre plots...</p>
<p>Severus had ended up serving Dumbledore afterward; perhaps the
Death Eaters would not look kindly on Severus if Dumbledore
revealed his role in their defeat.</p>
<p>Dumbledore had tried to arrange for Harry's mother to be spared.
But that part of his plot had failed. And he had knowingly
condemned James Potter to his death.</p>
<p>Dumbledore was responsible for the deaths of Harry's parents.
<em>If</em> the whole chain of logic was correct. Harry could not,
in justice, say that successfully ending the Wizarding War did not
count as extenuating circumstances. But somehow this still...
<em>bothered him a great deal.</em></p>
<p>And it was time and past time to ask Draco Malfoy what the
<em>other</em> side of that war had to say about the character of
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore.</p>

<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 43: Humanism, Pt 1<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>The gentle sun of January shone on the cold fields outside
Hogwarts.</p>
<p>For some of the students it was a study hour, and others had
been let out of class. The first-years who'd signed up for it were
practicing a certain spell, a spell that was most advantageously
learned outdoors, beneath the bright sun and a clear blue sky,
rather than within the confines of any classroom. Cookies and
lemonade were also considered helpful.</p>
<p>The early gestures of the spell were complex and precise; you
twitched your wand once, twice, thrice, and four times with small
tilts at exactly the right relative angles, you shifted your
forefinger and thumb exactly the right distances...</p>
<p>The Ministry thought this meant it was futile to try and teach
anyone the spell before their fifth year. There had been a few
known cases of younger children learning it, and this had been
dismissed as "genius".</p>
<p>It might not have been a very polite way of putting it, but
Harry was beginning to see why Professor Quirrell had claimed that
the Ministry Committee of Curriculum would have been of greater
benefit to wizardkind if they had been used as landfill.</p>
<p>So the gestures were complicated and delicate. That didn't stop
you from learning it when you were eleven. It meant you had to be
extra careful and practice each part for a lot longer than usual,
that was all.</p>
<p>Most Charms that could only be learned by older students were
like that because they required more strength of magic than any
young student could muster. But the Patronus Charm <em>wasn't</em>
like that, it wasn't difficult because it needed too much magic, it
was difficult because it took <em>more</em> than mere magic.</p>
<p>It took the warm, happy feelings that you kept close in your
heart, the loving memories, a different kind of strength that you
didn't need for ordinary spells.</p>
<p>Harry twitched his wand once, twice, thrice and four times,
shifted his fingers exactly the right distances...</p>
<p><em>"Good luck at school, Harry. Do you think I bought you
enough books?"</em></p>
<p><em>"You can never have enough books... but you certainly tried,
it was a really, really, really good try..."</em></p>
<p>It had brought tears to his eyes, the first time Harry had
remembered and tried to put it into the spell.</p>
<p>Harry brought the wand up and around and brandished it, a
gesture that didn't have to be precise, only bold and defiant.</p>
<p>"<em>Expecto Patronum!</em> " cried Harry.</p>
<p>Nothing happened.</p>
<p>Not a single flicker of light.</p>
<p>When Harry looked up, Remus Lupin was still studying the wand, a
rather troubled look on his faintly scarred face.</p>
<p>Finally Remus shook his head. "I'm sorry, Harry," the man said
quietly. "Your wandwork was exactly right."</p>
<p>And there wasn't a flicker of light anywhere else, either,
because all the other first-years who were supposed to be
practicing their Patronus Charms had been glancing out of the
corners of their eyes at Harry instead.</p>
<p>The tears were threatening to come back into Harry's eyes, and
they weren't happy tears. Of all the things, of all the things,
Harry had never expected this.</p>
<p>There was something horribly humiliating about being informed
that you weren't happy enough.</p>
<p>What did Anthony Goldstein have inside him that Harry didn't,
that made Anthony's wand shine with that bright light?</p>
<p>Did Anthony love his own father more?</p>
<p>"What thought were you using to cast it?" said Remus.</p>
<p>"My father," Harry said, his voice trembling. "I asked him to
buy me some books before I came to Hogwarts, and he did, and they
were expensive, and then he asked me if they were enough -"</p>
<p>Harry didn't try to explain about the Verres family motto.</p>
<p>"Take a rest before you try a different thought, Harry," said
Remus. He gestured toward where some other students were sitting on
the ground, looking disappointed or embarrassed or regretful. "You
won't be able to cast a Patronus Charm while you're feeling ashamed
of not being grateful enough." There was a gentle compassion in Mr.
Lupin's voice, and for a moment, Harry felt like hitting
something.</p>
<p>Instead Harry turned around, and stalked to where the other
failures were sitting. The other students whose wandwork had also
been proclaimed perfect, and who were now supposed to be searching
for happier thoughts; by the looks of them they weren't making much
progress. There were many robes there trimmed in dark blue, and a
handful of red, and one lone Hufflepuff girl who was still crying.
The Slytherins hadn't even bothered showing up, except for Daphne
Greengrass and Tracey Davis, who were still trying to get the
gestures.</p>
<p>Harry plopped down on the cold dead grass of winter, next to the
student whose failure had surprised him the most.</p>
<p>"So you couldn't do it either," Hermione said. She'd fled the
field at first, but she'd come back after that, and you had to look
closely at her reddened eyes to see that she'd been crying.</p>
<p>"I," Harry said, "I, I'd probably feel a lot worse about that if
you hadn't failed, you're the nicest, person I know, that I've ever
met, Hermione, and if <em>you</em> also can't do it, it means I
might still be, be good..."</p>
<p>"I should have gone to Gryffindor," Hermione whispered. She
blinked hard a few times, but she didn't wipe her eyes.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The boy and the girl walked forward together, definitely not
holding hands, but each drawing a kind of strength from the other's
presence, something that let them ignore the whispers of their
year-mates, as they walked through the hallway approaching the
great doors of Hogwarts.</p>
<p>Harry hadn't been able to cast the Patronus Charm no matter what
happy thought he tried. People hadn't seemed surprised by that,
which made it even worse. Hermione hadn't been able to do it
either. People had been <em>very</em> surprised by that, and Harry
had seen her starting to get the same sidelong looks as him. The
other Ravenclaws who'd failed weren't getting those looks. But
Hermione was the Sunshine General, and her fans were treating it
like she'd failed them, somehow, like she'd betrayed a promise
she'd never made.</p>
<p>The two of them had gone to the library to research the Patronus
Charm, which was Hermione's way of dealing with distress, as it was
sometimes also Harry's. Study, learn, try to understand
<em>why...</em></p>
<p>The books had confirmed what the Headmaster had told Harry;
often, wizards who couldn't cast the Patronus Charm in practice
would be able to do so in the presence of a real Dementor, going
from flat failure all the way to a full corporeal Patronus. It
defied all logic, the Dementor's aura of fear ought to make it
<em>harder</em> to wield a happy thought; but that was the way it
was.</p>
<p>So the two of them were both going to give it one last try,
there was no way either of them wouldn't give it one last try.</p>
<p>It was the day the Dementor came to Hogwarts.</p>
<p>Earlier, Harry had unTransfigured his father's rock from where
it usually rested on his pinky ring in the form of a tiny diamond,
and placed the huge gray stone back into his pouch. Just in case
Harry's magic failed entirely, when he confronted the darkest of
all creatures.</p>
<p>Harry had already started to feel pessimistic, and he wasn't
even in front of a Dementor yet.</p>
<p>"I bet you can do it and I can't," Harry said in a whisper. "I
bet that's what happens."</p>
<p>"It felt wrong to me," Hermione said, her voice even quieter
than his. "I tried it this morning and I realized. When I was doing
the brandish at the end, even before I said the words, it felt
wrong."</p>
<p>Harry didn't say anything. He'd felt the same thing, right from
the start, though it had taken another five attempts using five
other happy thoughts before he'd been able to acknowledge it to
himself. Every time he tried to brandish his wand, it had felt
hollow; the spell he was trying to learn didn't fit him.</p>
<p>"It doesn't mean we're going to be Dark Wizards," said Harry.
"Lots of people who can't cast the Patronus Charm aren't Dark
Wizards. Godric Gryffindor wasn't a Dark Wizard..."</p>
<p>Godric had defeated Dark Lords, fought to protect commoners from
Noble Houses and Muggles from wizards. He'd had many fine friends
and true, and lost no more than half of them in one good cause or
another. He'd listened to the screams of the wounded, in the armies
he'd raised to defend the innocent; young wizards of courage had
rallied to his calls, and he'd buried them afterward. Until
finally, when his wizardry had only just begun to fail him in his
old age, he'd brought together the three other most powerful
wizards of his era to raise Hogwarts from the bare ground; the one
great accomplishment to Godric's name that wasn't about war, any
kind of war, no matter how just. It was Salazar, and not Godric,
who'd taught the first Hogwarts class in Battle Magic. Godric had
taught the first Hogwarts class in Herbology, the magics of green
growing life.</p>
<p>To his last day he'd never been able to cast the Patronus
Charm.</p>
<p>Godric Gryffindor had been a good man, not a happy one.</p>
<p>Harry didn't believe in angst, he couldn't stand reading about
whiny heroes, he knew a billion other people in the world would
have given anything to trade places with him, and...</p>
<p>And on his deathbed, Godric had told Helga (for Salazar had
abandoned him, and Rowena passed before) that he didn't regret any
of it, and he was <em>not</em> warning his students not to follow
in his footsteps, no one was <em>ever</em> to say he'd told anyone
not to follow in his footsteps. If it had been the right thing for
<em>him</em> to do, then he wouldn't tell anyone else to choose
wrongly, not even the youngest student in Hogwarts. And yet for
those who <em>did</em> follow in his footsteps, he hoped they would
remember that Gryffindor had told his House that it was all right
for them to be happier than him. That red and gold would be bright
warm colors, from now on.</p>
<p>And Helga had promised him, weeping, that when she was
Headmistress she would make sure of it.</p>
<p>Whereupon Godric had died, and left no ghost behind him; and
Harry had shoved the book back to Hermione and walked away a
little, so she wouldn't see him crying.</p>
<p>You wouldn't think that a book with an innocent title like "The
Patronus Charm: Wizards Who Could and Couldn't" would be the
saddest book Harry had ever read.</p>
<p>Harry...</p>
<p>Harry didn't want that.</p>
<p>To be in that book.</p>
<p>Harry didn't want that.</p>
<p>The rest of the school just seemed to think that <em>No
Patronus</em> meant <em>Bad Person,</em> plain and simple. Somehow
the fact that Godric Gryffindor also hadn't been able to cast the
Patronus Charm seemed not to get repeated. Maybe people didn't talk
about it to respect his last wish, Fred and George probably didn't
know and Harry certainly wasn't about to tell them. Or maybe the
other failures didn't mention it because it was less shameful, the
smaller loss of pride and status, to be thought Dark rather than
unhappy.</p>
<p>Harry saw that Hermione, beside him, was blinking hard; and he
wondered if she was thinking of Rowena Ravenclaw, who'd also loved
books.</p>
<p>"Okay," Harry whispered. "Happier thoughts. If you do go to a
full corporeal Patronus, what do you think your animal will
be?"</p>
<p>"An otter," Hermione said at once.</p>
<p>"An <em>otter?</em> " Harry whispered incredulously.</p>
<p>"Yes, an otter," said Hermione. "What about yours?"</p>
<p>"Peregrine falcon," Harry said without hesitation. "It can dive
faster than three hundred kilometers per hour, it's the fastest
living creature there is." The peregrine falcon had been Harry's
favorite animal since forever. Harry was determined to become an
Animagus someday, just to get that as his form, and fly by the
strength of his own wings, and see the land below with sharper
eyes... "But why an <em>otter?</em> "</p>
<p>Hermione smiled, but didn't say anything.</p>
<p>And the vast doors of Hogwarts swung open.</p>
<p>They walked for a time, the children, over a pathway that led
toward the unforbidden forest, and continued through the forest
itself. The Sun was lowering to near the horizon, the shadows long,
the sunlight filtered through the bare branches of the winter
trees; for it was January, and the first-years the last to learn,
that day.</p>
<p>Then the path swerved and took a new direction, and they all saw
it in the distance, the clearing in the forest, and the sere winter
grounds, yellowing dried grass whitened by a few small remnants of
snow.</p>
<p>The human figures still small at that range. The two spots of
dim white light from the Aurors' Patronuses, and the brighter spot
of silver light from the Headmaster's, next to something...</p>
<p>Harry squinted.</p>
<p>Something...</p>
<p>It must have been purely Harry's imagination, because there
shouldn't have been any way for a Dementor to reach past three
corporeal Patronuses, but he thought he could feel a touch of
emptiness brushing at his mind, brushing straight at the soft inner
center of himself without any respect for Occlumency barriers.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Seamus Finnigan was ashen and trembling as he rejoined the
students milling about on the withered and snow-spotted grass.
Seamus's Patronus Charm had been successful, but there was still
that interval between when the Headmaster dispelled his own
Patronus and when you were supposed to cast your own, when you
faced the Dementor's fear unshielded.</p>
<p>Up to twenty seconds of exposure at five paces was certainly
safe, even for an eleven-year-old wizard with weak resistance and a
still-maturing brain. There was a lot of variance in how hard the
Dementor's power hit people, which was another thing not quite
understood; but twenty seconds was definitely safe.</p>
<p>Forty seconds of Dementor exposure at five paces might
<em>possibly</em> have been enough to cause permanent damage,
though only to the most sensitive subjects.</p>
<p>It was harsh training even by the standards of Hogwarts, where
the way you learned to fly on a hippogriff was by being tossed on
one and told to get going. Harry was no fan of overprotectiveness,
and if you looked at the difference in maturity between a
fourth-year in Hogwarts and a fourteen-year-old Muggle, it was
clear that Muggles were smothering their children... but even Harry
had started to wonder if this was pushing it. Not every hurt could
be healed afterward.</p>
<p>But if you couldn't cast the spell under those conditions, it
meant you couldn't rely on using the Patronus Charm to defend
yourself; overconfidence was even more dangerous to wizards than to
Muggles. Dementors could drain your magic and your physical
vitality, not just your happy thoughts, which meant you might
<em>not</em> be able to Apparate away if you waited too long, or if
you didn't recognize the approaching fear until the Dementor was
within range for its attack. (During his reading, Harry had
discovered with considerable horror that some books claimed the
Dementor's Kiss would <em>eat your soul</em> and that this was the
reason for the permanent mindless coma into which it put the
victims. And that wizards who <em>believed this</em> had
deliberately used the Dementor's Kiss to <em>execute
criminals.</em> It was a certainty that some called criminals were
innocent, and even if they weren't, <em>destroying their
souls?</em> If Harry had believed in souls, he would have... drawn
a blank, he just couldn't think of an appropriate response to
that.)</p>
<p>The Headmaster was taking security seriously, and so were the
three Aurors standing guard. Their leader was an Asianish-looking
man, solemn without being grim, Auror Komodo, whose wand never left
his hand. His Patronus, an orangutan of solid moonlight, paced back
and forth between the Dementor and the first-years awaiting their
turn; beside the orangutan moved the bright white panther of Auror
Butnaru, a man with a piercing gaze, long black hair in a ponytail,
and a long braided goatee. Those two Aurors, and their two
Patronuses, were all watching the Dementor. On the opposite side of
the students was the resting Auror Goryanof, tall and thin and pale
and unshaven, sitting back on a chair he'd conjured without word or
wand, and maintaining an absentminded pokerface as he scanned the
entire scene. Professor Quirrell had shown up not long after the
first-years began their attempts, and his eyes never strayed far
from Harry. The tiny Professor Flitwick, who had been a champion
duellist, was fiddling absently with his wand; and <em>his</em>
eyes, peering out from within the huge puffy beard that served as
his face, stayed focused on Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>And it must have been Harry's imagination, but Professor
Quirrell seemed to wince slightly each time the Headmaster's
Patronus winked out to test the next student. Maybe Professor
Quirrell was imagining the same placebo effect as Harry, that
backwash of emptiness caressing at his mind.</p>
<p>"Anthony Goldstein," called the voice of the Headmaster.</p>
<p>Harry quietly walked toward Seamus, even as Anthony began to
approach the shining silver phoenix, and... whatever it was beneath
the tattered cloak.</p>
<p>"What did you see?" Harry asked Seamus in a low voice.</p>
<p>A lot of students hadn't answered Harry, when he'd tried to
gather the data; but Seamus was Finnigan of Chaos, one of Harry's
lieutenants. Maybe that wasn't fair, but...</p>
<p>"Dead," said Seamus in a whisper, "grayish and slimy... dead and
left in water for a while... "</p>
<p>Harry nodded. "That's what a lot of people see," Harry said. He
projected confidence, even though it was fake, because Seamus
needed it. "Go eat some chocolate, you'll feel better."</p>
<p>Seamus nodded and stumbled off toward the table of healing
sweets.</p>
<p>"<em>Expecto Patronum!</em> " cried a young boy's voice.</p>
<p>Then there were gasps of shock, even from the Aurors.</p>
<p>Harry spun around to look -</p>
<p>There was a brilliant silver bird standing between Anthony
Goldstein and the cage. The bird reared its head and let out a cry,
and the cry was also silver, as bright and hard and beautiful as
metal.</p>
<p>And something in the back of Harry's mind said, <em>if that's a
peregrine falcon, I'm going to strangle him in his sleep.</em></p>
<p><em>Shut up,</em> Harry said to the thought, <em>do you want us
to be a Dark Wizard?</em></p>
<p><em>What's the point? You're going to end up as one
eventually.</em></p>
<p>That... wasn't something Harry would usually have thought...</p>
<p><em>It's a placebo effect,</em> Harry told himself again.
<em>The Dementor can't actually get to me through three corporeal
Patronuses, I'm just imagining what I think it's like. When I
actually face the Dementor, it'll feel completely different, and
then I'll know I was just being silly before.</em></p>
<p>A slight chill went down Harry's spine then, because he had a
feeling that yes, it <em>would</em> be completely different, and
not in a positive direction.</p>
<p>The blazing silver phoenix sprang back into existence from the
Headmaster's wand, the lesser bird vanished; and Anthony Goldstein
began to walk back.</p>
<p>The Headmaster was coming with Anthony instead of calling out
the next name, the Patronus waiting behind to guard the
Dementor.</p>
<p>Harry glanced over to where Hermione was standing, just behind
the glowing panther. Hermione's turn would have come next, but had
apparently just been delayed.</p>
<p>She looked stressed.</p>
<p>Earlier, she'd politely asked Harry to please stop trying to
destress her.</p>
<p>Dumbledore was smiling slightly as he escorted Anthony back
toward the others; smiling only slightly, because the Headmaster
looked very, very tired.</p>
<p>"Unbelievable," said Dumbledore in a voice that sounded much
weaker than his accustomed boom. "A corporeal Patronus, in his
first year. And an astounding number of successes among the other
young students. Quirinus, I must acknowledge that you have proved
your point."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell inclined his head. "A simple enough guess, I
should think. A Dementor attacks through fear, and children are
less afraid."</p>
<p>"<em>Less</em> afraid?" said Auror Goryanof from where he was
sitting.</p>
<p>"So I said as well," said Dumbledore. "And Professor Quirrell
pointed out that adults had more courage, not less to fear; which
thought, I confess, had never occurred to me before."</p>
<p>"That was not my <em>precise</em> phrasing," Professor Quirrell
said dryly, "but it will do. And the rest of our agreement,
Headmaster?"</p>
<p>"As you say," Dumbledore said reluctantly. "I admit I was not
expecting to lose that wager, Quirinus, but you have proven your
wisdom."</p>
<p>All the students were looking at them, puzzled; except Hermione,
who was staring in the direction of the cage and the tall decaying
robes; and Harry, who was watching everyone, since he was imagining
himself feeling paranoid.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell said, in tones that did not invite further
comments, "I am allowed to teach the Killing Curse to students who
wish to learn it. Which will render them considerably safer from
Dark Wizards and other pests, and it is foolish to think they will
otherwise know no deadly magics." Professor Quirrell paused, his
eyes narrowing. "Headmaster, I respectfully observe that you are
not looking well. I suggest leaving the remainder of the day's task
to Professor Flitwick."</p>
<p>Dumbledore shook his head. "We are almost done for the day,
Quirinus. I will last."</p>
<p>Hermione had approached Anthony. "Captain Goldstein," she said,
and her voice trembled only a little, "can you give me any
advice?"</p>
<p>"Don't be afraid," Anthony said firmly. "Don't think about
anything it tries to make you think about. You're not just holding
up the wand in front of you as a shield against the fear, you're
<em>brandishing</em> your wand to drive the fear away, that's how
you make a happy thought into something solid..." Anthony shrugged
helplessly. "I mean, I <em>heard</em> all that before, but..."</p>
<p>Other students were starting to congregate around Anthony, with
their own questions.</p>
<p>"Miss Granger?" the Headmaster said. His voice might have been
gentle, or just weakened.</p>
<p>Hermione straightened her shoulders, and followed him.</p>
<p>"What did you see under the cloak?" Harry said to Anthony.</p>
<p>Anthony looked at Harry, surprised, and then answered, "A very
tall man who was dead, I mean, sort of dead-shaped and
dead-colored... it hurt to see him and I knew that was the Dementor
trying to get at me."</p>
<p>Harry looked back out at where Hermione was confronting the cage
and the cloak.</p>
<p>Hermione raised her wand into position for the first
gestures.</p>
<p>The Headmaster's phoenix winked out of existence.</p>
<p>And Hermione gave a tiny, pathetic shriek, flinched -</p>
<p>- took a step back, Harry could see her wand moving, and then
she brandished it and said "Expecto Patronum!"</p>
<p>Nothing happened.</p>
<p>Hermione turned and ran.</p>
<p>"<em>Expecto Patronum!</em> " said the Headmaster's deeper
voice, and the silver phoenix blazed back to life.</p>
<p>The young girl stumbled, and kept running, strange sounds
beginning to come from her throat.</p>
<p>"<em>Hermione!</em> " Susan yelled it, and Hannah, and Daphne,
and Ernie, and they all started to run toward her; even as Harry,
who was always thinking one step ahead, spun on his own heel and
ran for the table with the chocolate.</p>
<p>Even after Harry had shoved the chocolate into Hermione's mouth
and she'd chewed and swallowed, she was still breathing in great
gasps and crying, her eyes still seemed unfocused.</p>
<p><em>She can't have been permanently Demented,</em> Harry thought
desperately at the confusion inside him, the horrible fear and
deathly fury beginning to twist around each other, <em>she can't
have been, she wasn't exposed for even ten seconds let alone forty
-</em></p>
<p>But she could be <em>temporarily</em> Demented, as Harry
realized in that moment, there wasn't any rule that you couldn't be
<em>temporarily</em> injured by a Dementor in just ten seconds if
you were sensitive enough.</p>
<p>Then Hermione's eyes seemed to focus, and dart around, and
settle on him.</p>
<p>"Harry," she gasped, and the other students went silent. "Harry,
don't. <em>Don't!</em> "</p>
<p>Harry was suddenly afraid to ask what he shouldn't do, was
<em>he</em> in her worst memories, or some sleep's nightmare that
she was now reliving in waking life?</p>
<p>"<em>Don't go near it!"</em> said Hermione. Her hand reached
out, grabbed him by the lapel of his robes. "You mustn't go near
it, Harry! <em>It spoke to me, Harry, it knows you, it knows you're
here!</em> "</p>
<p>"What -" Harry said, and then cursed himself for asking.</p>
<p>"<em>The Dementor!</em> " said Hermione. Her voice rose to a
shriek. "<em>Professor Quirrell wants it to eat you!</em> "</p>
<p>In the sudden hush, Professor Quirrell came forward a few steps;
but he didn't approach any closer (Harry was there, after all).
"Miss Granger," he said, and his voice was grave, "I think you
should have some more chocolate."</p>
<p>"<em>Professor Flitwick, don't let Harry try, send him
back!</em> "</p>
<p>The Headmaster had arrived by then, and he and Professor
Flitwick were exchanging worried looks.</p>
<p>"I did not hear the Dementor speak," the Headmaster said.
"Still..."</p>
<p>"Just ask," said Professor Quirrell, sounding a little
weary.</p>
<p>"Did the Dementor say <em>how</em> it would get to Harry?" said
the Headmaster.</p>
<p>"All his tastiest parts first," said Hermione, "it would - it
would eat -"</p>
<p>Hermione blinked. Some sanity seemed to come back into her
eyes.</p>
<p>Then she started crying.</p>
<p>"You were too brave, Hermione Granger," the Headmaster said. His
voice was gentle, and clearly audible. "Too much braver than I
comprehended. You should have turned and run, not endured and tried
to complete your Charm. When you are older and stronger, Miss
Granger, I know that you will try again, and I know that you will
succeed."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," Hermione said in gasps, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm
sorry... I'm sorry, Harry, I can't tell you what I saw, I didn't
look at it, I didn't dare look at it, I knew it was too horrible to
ever be seen..."</p>
<p>It should have been Harry, but he'd hesitated, because his hands
were all chocolatey; and then Ernie and Susan were there, helping
Hermione from where she'd fallen on the grass, leading her toward
the snacks table.</p>
<p>Five bars of chocolate later, Hermione seemed to be all right
again, and she went over and apologized to Professor Quirrell; but
she was always watching Harry, every time that he glanced in her
direction. He'd stepped toward her only once, and stopped when
she'd stepped away. Her eyes had silently apologized, and silently
pleaded for him to leave her be.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Neville Longbottom had seen something dead and half-dissolved,
oozing and running with a face like a squashed sponge.</p>
<p>It was the worst thing anyone had yet described seeing. Neville
had been able to produce a small flicker of light from his wand
before, but he had, intelligently and with great presence of mind,
turned and run away instead of trying to cast his own Patronus
Charm.</p>
<p>(The Headmaster had said nothing to the other students, told no
one else to be less brave; but Professor Quirrell had calmly
observed that if you made the mistake <em>after</em> being warned,
that was when ignorance became stupidity.)</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell?" Harry said in a low voice, having come as
close to the Defense Professor as he dared. "What do <em>you</em>
see when you -"</p>
<p>"Don't ask." The voice was very flat.</p>
<p>Harry nodded respectfully. "What was your <em>original</em>
phrasing to the Headmaster, if I can ask?"</p>
<p>Dryly. "Our worst memories can only grow worse as we grow
older."</p>
<p>"Ah," Harry said. "Logical."</p>
<p>Something strange flickered in Professor Quirrell's eyes, then,
as he looked at Harry. "Let us hope," Professor Quirrell said,
"that you succeed upon this try, Mr. Potter. For if you do, the
Headmaster may teach you his trick of using a Patronus to send
messages that cannot be forged or intercepted, and the military
importance of that is impossible to overstate. It would be a
tremendous advantage to the Chaos Legion, and someday, I suspect,
this entire country. But if you do <em>not</em> succeed, Mr.
Potter... well, <em>I</em> shall understand."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Morag MacDougal had said, in a wavering voice, "Ouch", and
Dumbledore had recast his Patronus right away.</p>
<p>Parvati Patil had produced a corporeal Patronus in the form of a
tiger, larger than Dumbledore's phoenix, though not nearly as
bright. There had been a great burst of applause from all the
watchers, though not the same shock as when Anthony had done
it.</p>
<p>And then it was Harry's turn.</p>
<p>The Headmaster called the name of Harry Potter, and Harry was
afraid.</p>
<p>Harry knew, he knew that he was going to fail, and he knew that
it was going to hurt.</p>
<p>But he still had to try; because sometimes, in the presence of a
Dementor, a wizard went from not a flicker of light to a full
corporeal Patronus, and no one understood why.</p>
<p>And because if Harry <em>couldn't</em> defend himself from
Dementors, he had to be able to recognize their approach, recognize
the feeling of them in his mind, and run before it was too
late.</p>
<p><em>What is my worst memory...?</em></p>
<p>Harry had expected the Headmaster to give him a worried look, or
a hopeful look, or deeply wise advice; but instead Albus Dumbledore
only watched him with quiet calm.</p>
<p><em>He thinks I'm going to fail, but he won't sabotage me by
telling me so,</em> thought Harry, <em>if he had true words of
encouragement to speak, he would speak them...</em></p>
<p>The cage came closer. It was already tarnished, but not rusted
away to nothing, not yet.</p>
<p>The cloak came closer. It was unraveling and shot through with
unpatched holes; it had been new that morning, Auror Goryanof had
said.</p>
<p>"Headmaster?" Harry said. "What do you see?"</p>
<p>The Headmaster's voice was also calm. "The Dementors are
creatures of fear, and as your fear of the Dementor diminishes, so
does the fearsomeness of its form. I see a tall, thin, naked man.
He is not decaying. He is only slightly painful to look upon. That
is all. What do you see, Harry?"</p>
<p>...Harry couldn't see under the cloak.</p>
<p>Or that wasn't right, it was that his mind was <em>refusing</em>
to see what was under the cloak...</p>
<p>No, his mind was trying to see the <em>wrong</em> thing under
the cloak, Harry could feel it, his eyes trying to force a mistake.
But Harry had done his best to train himself to notice that tiny
feeling of confusion, to automatically flinch away from making
stuff up; and every time his mind tried to start inventing a lie
about what was under the cloak, that reflex was fast enough to shut
it down.</p>
<p>Harry looked under the cloak and saw...</p>
<p>An open question. Harry wouldn't let his mind see something
false, and so he didn't see anything, like the part of his visual
cortex getting that signal was just ceasing to exist. There was a
blind spot under the cloak. Harry couldn't know what was under
there.</p>
<p>Just that it was far worse than any decaying mummy.</p>
<p>The unseeable horror beneath the cloak was very close, now, but
the blazing bird of moonlight, the white phoenix, yet lay between
them.</p>
<p>Harry wanted to run away like some of the other students had.
Half the ones who'd had no luck with their Patronus Charms just
hadn't shown up today in the first place. Of those remaining, half
had fled before the Headmaster had even dispelled his own Patronus,
and no one had said a word. There'd been a little laughter when
Terry had turned and walked back before his own try; and Susan and
Hannah, who'd gone before, had yelled at everyone to shut up.</p>
<p>But Harry was the Boy-Who-Lived, and he would lose much respect
if he was seen to give up without even trying...</p>
<p>Pride and roles seemed to diminish and fall away, in the
presence of whatever lay beneath the cloak.</p>
<p><em>Why am I still here?</em></p>
<p>It wasn't the shame of others thinking him cowardly, that kept
Harry's feet in place.</p>
<p>It wasn't the hope of repairing his reputation that brought up
his wand.</p>
<p>It wasn't the desire to master the Patronus Charm as magic, that
moved his fingers into the initial position.</p>
<p>It was something else, something that <em>had</em> to oppose
whatever lay beneath the cloak, this was the true darkness and
Harry had to find out whether it lay within him, the power to drive
it back.</p>
<p>Harry had planned to try one final time to think of his
book-shopping spree with his father, but instead, at the last
minute, facing the Dementor, a different memory occurred to him,
something he hadn't tried before; a thought that wasn't warm and
happy in the ordinary way, but felt righter, somehow.</p>
<p>And Harry remembered the stars, remembered them burning terribly
bright and unwavering in the Silent Night; he let that image fill
him, fill all of him like an Occlumency barrier across his entire
mind, became once again the bodiless awareness of the void.</p>
<p>The bright silver shining phoenix vanished.</p>
<p>And the Dementor smashed into his mind like the fist of God.</p>
<p><strong>FEAR / COLD / DARKNESS</strong></p>
<p>There was an instant when the two forces clashed head-on, when
the peaceful starlit memory held its own against the fear, even as
Harry's fingers began the wand motions, practiced until they had
become automatic. They weren't warm and happy, those blazing points
of light in perfect blackness; but it was an image the Dementor
could not easily pierce. For the silent burning stars were vast and
unafraid, and to shine in the cold and darkness was their natural
state.</p>
<p>But there was a flaw, a crack, a fault-line in the immovable
object trying to resist that irresistible force. Harry felt a
twinge of anger at the Dementor for trying to feed on him, and it
was like slipping on wet ice. Harry's mind began to slide sideways,
into bitterness, black fury, deathly hatred -</p>
<p>Harry's wand came up in the final brandish.</p>
<p>It felt wrong.</p>
<p>"Expecto Patronum," his voice spoke, the words hollow and
pointless.</p>
<p>And Harry fell into his dark side, fell down into his dark side,
further and faster and deeper than ever before, down down down as
the slide accelerated, as the Dementor latched onto the exposed and
vulnerable parts and fed on them, eating away the light. A fading
reflex scrabbled for warmth, but even as an image of Hermione came
to him, or an image of Mum and Dad, the Dementor twisted it, showed
him Hermione lying dead on the ground, the corpses of his mother
and father, and then even that was sucked away.</p>
<p>Into the vacuum rose the memory, the worst memory, something
forgotten so long ago that the neural patterns shouldn't have still
existed.</p>
<p><em>"Lily, take Harry and go! It's him!" shouted a man's voice.
"Go! Run! I'll hold him off!"</em></p>
<p><em>And Harry couldn't help but think, in the empty depths of
his dark side, how ridiculously overconfident James Potter had
been. Hold off Lord Voldemort? With what?</em></p>
<p><em>Then the other voice spoke, high-pitched like the hiss of a
teakettle, and it was like dry ice laid on Harry's every nerve,
like a brand of metal cooled to liquid helium temperatures and laid
on every part of him. And the voice said:</em></p>
<p><em>"Avadakedavra."</em></p>
<p>(The wand flew from the boy's nerveless fingers as his body
began to convulse and fall, the Headmaster's eyes widening in alarm
as he began his own Patronus Charm.)</p>
<p><em>"Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry!" screamed the
woman's voice.</em></p>
<p><em>Whatever was left of Harry listened with all the light
drained out of him, in the dead void of his heart, and wondered if
she thought that Lord Voldemort would stop because she asked
politely.</em></p>
<p><em>"Step aside, woman!" said the shrill voice of burning cold.
"For you I am not come, only the boy."</em></p>
<p><em>"Not Harry! Please... have mercy... have mercy..."</em></p>
<p><em>Lily Potter, Harry thought, seemed not to understand what
type of people became Dark Lords in the first place; and if this
was the best strategy she could conceive to save her child's life,
that was her final failure as a mother.</em></p>
<p><em>"I give you this rare chance to flee," said the shrill
voice. "But I will not trouble myself to subdue you, and your death
here will not save your child. Step aside, foolish woman, if you
have any sense in you at all!"</em></p>
<p><em>"Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead!"</em></p>
<p><em>The empty thing that was Harry wondered if Lily Potter
seriously imagined that Lord Voldemort would say yes, kill her, and
then depart leaving her son unharmed.</em></p>
<p><em>"Very well," said the voice of death, now sounding coldly
amused, "I accept the bargain. Yourself to die, and the child to
live. Now drop your wand so that I can murder you."</em></p>
<p><em>There was a hideous silence.</em></p>
<p><em>Lord Voldemort began to laugh, horrible contemptuous
laughter.</em></p>
<p><em>And then, at last, Lily Potter's voice shrieked in desperate
hate, "Avada ke-"</em></p>
<p><em>The lethal voice finished first, the curse rapid and
precise.</em></p>
<p><em>"Avadakedavra."</em></p>
<p><em>A blinding flare of green marked the end of Lily
Potter.</em></p>
<p><em>And the boy in the crib saw it, the eyes, those two crimson
eyes, seeming to glow bright red, to blaze like miniature suns,
filling Harry's whole vision as they locked to his own -</em></p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The other children saw Harry Potter fall, they heard Harry
Potter scream, a thin high-pitched scream that seemed to pierce
their ears like knives.</p>
<p>There was a brilliant silver flash as the Headmaster bellowed
"<em>Expecto Patronum!</em> " and the blazing phoenix returned to
being.</p>
<p>But Harry Potter's horrible scream went on and on and on, even
as the Headmaster scooped up the boy in his arms and bore him away
from the Dementor, even as Neville Longbottom and Professor
Flitwick both went for the chocolate at the same time and -</p>
<p>Hermione knew it, she knew it as she saw it, she knew that her
nightmare had been real, it was coming true, somehow it was coming
true.</p>
<p>"Get him chocolate!" demanded the voice of Professor Quirrell,
pointlessly, because Professor Flitwick's tiny form was already
cannonballing toward where the Headmaster was racing toward the
students.</p>
<p>Hermione was moving forward herself, though she didn't know what
else she meant to do -</p>
<p>"<em>Cast Patronuses!</em> " shouted the Headmaster, as he
brought Harry behind the Aurors. "<em>Everyone who can! Get them
between Harry and the Dementor! It's still feeding on
him!</em> "</p>
<p>There was a moment of frozen horror.</p>
<p>"<em>Expecto Patronum!</em> " shouted Professor Flitwick and
Auror Goryanof, and then Anthony Goldstein, but he failed the first
time, and then Parvati Patil, who succeeded, and then Anthony tried
again and his silver bird spread its wings and screamed at the
Dementor, and Dean Thomas roared the words like they had been
written in letters of fire and his wand gave birth to a towering
white bear; there were eight blazing Patronuses all in a line
between Harry and the Dementor, and Harry went on screaming and
screaming as the Headmaster laid him on the dried grass.</p>
<p>Hermione couldn't cast a Patronus Charm, so she ran toward where
Harry lay. In her mind, something tried to guess how long it had
been already. Was it twenty seconds? More?</p>
<p>There was a dreadful agony and bewilderment on the face of Albus
Dumbledore. His long black wand was in his hand, but he spoke no
spells, only looked down at Harry's convulsing body in horror -</p>
<p>Hermione didn't know what to do, she didn't know what to do, she
didn't understand what was happening, and the most powerful wizard
in the world seemed equally at a loss.</p>
<p>"<em>Use your phoenix!</em> " bellowed Professor Quirrell.
"<em>Take him far away from that Dementor!</em> "</p>
<p>Without a single word the Headmaster scooped up Harry in his
arms and vanished in a crack of fire along with the suddenly
appearing Fawkes; and the Headmaster's Patronus winked out, where
it had guarded the Dementor.</p>
<p>Horror and confusion and sudden babble.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter should recover," Professor Quirrell said, raising
his voice, but his tone now calm once again, "I think it was just
over twenty seconds."</p>
<p>Then the blazing white phoenix appeared again, like it was
flying before them from elsewhere, to Hermione Granger came the
creature of moonlight, and it cried to her in Albus Dumbledore's
voice:</p>
<p>"<em>It still feeds on him, even here! How? If you know,
Hermione Granger, you must tell me! Tell me!</em> "</p>
<p>The senior Auror turned to stare at her, and so did many
students. Professor Flitwick didn't turn, he was now leveling his
wand on Professor Quirrell, who was holding out clearly empty
hands.</p>
<p>Seconds ticked past, uncounted.</p>
<p>She couldn't remember it, she couldn't remember the nightmare
clearly, she couldn't remember why she had thought it was possible,
why she had been afraid -</p>
<p>Hermione realized then what she ought to do, and it was the
hardest decision of her life.</p>
<p>What if whatever had happened to Harry, happened to her too?</p>
<p>All her limbs cold as death, her vision gone dark, fear
overwhelming everything; she'd seen Harry dying, Mum and Dad dying,
all her friends dying, everyone dying, so that in the end, when she
died, she would be alone. That was her secret nightmare she'd never
talked about with anyone, that had given the Dementor its power
over her, the loneliest thing was to die alone.</p>
<p>She didn't want to go to that place again, she, she didn't, she
didn't want to stay there forever -</p>
<p><em>You have courage enough for Gryffindor,</em> said the calm
voice of the Sorting Hat in her memory, <em>but you will do what is
right in any House I give you. You will learn, you will stand by
your friends, in any House you choose. So don't be afraid, Hermione
Granger, just decide where you belong...</em></p>
<p>There was no time for deciding, Harry was dying.</p>
<p>"I can't remember now," said Hermione, her voice cracking, "but
just hold on, I'll go in front of the Dementor again..."</p>
<p>She started to run toward the Dementor.</p>
<p>"Miss Granger!" squeaked Professor Flitwick, but he made no move
to stop her, only kept holding his wand on Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>"<em>Everyone!</em> " shouted Auror Komodo in a voice of
military command. "<em>Get your Patronuses out of her
way!</em> "</p>
<p>"<em>FLITWICK!</em> " roared Professor Quirrell. "<em>SUMMON
POTTER'S WAND!</em> "</p>
<p>Even as Hermione understood, Professor Flitwick was already
crying "<em>Accio!</em> ", and she saw the stick of wood zooming up
from where it had lain almost touching the Dementor's cage.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The eyes opened, dead and vacant.</p>
<p>"<em>Harry!</em> " gasped a voice in the colorless world.
"<em>Harry! Speak to me!</em> "</p>
<p>The face of Albus Dumbledore leaned over into the field of
vision, which had been occupied by a distant marble ceiling.</p>
<p>"You're annoying," said the empty voice. "You should die."</p>

<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 48: Utilitarian
Priorities<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>It was Saturday, the first morning of February, and at the
Ravenclaw table, a boy bearing a breakfast plate heaped high with
vegetables was nervously inspecting his servings for the slightest
trace of meat.</p>
<p>It <em>might</em> have been an overreaction. After he'd gotten
over the raw shock, Harry's common sense had woken up and
hypothesized that "Parseltongue" was probably just a linguistic
user interface for controlling snakes...</p>
<p>...after all, snakes couldn't <em>really</em> be human-level
intelligent, <em>someone</em> would have noticed by now. The
smallest-brained creatures Harry had ever heard of with anything
like linguistic ability were the African grey parrots taught by
Irene Pepperberg. And that was unstructured protolanguage, in a
species that played complex games of adultery and needed to model
other parrots. While according to what Draco had been able to
remember, snakes spoke to Parselmouths in what sounded like normal
human language - i.e., full-blown recursive syntactical grammar.
That had taken <em>time</em> for hominids to evolve, with huge
brains and strong social selection pressures. Snakes didn't have
much society at all that Harry had ever heard. And with thousands
upon thousands of different species of snakes all over the world,
how could they all use the <em>same</em> version of their supposed
language, "Parseltongue"?</p>
<p>Of course that was all merely common sense, in which Harry was
starting to lose faith entirely.</p>
<p>But Harry was sure he'd heard snakes hissing on the TV at some
point - after all, he knew what that sounded like from
<em>somewhere</em> - and <em>that</em> hadn't sounded to him like
language, which had seemed a good deal more reassuring...</p>
<p>...at first. The problem was that Draco had also asserted that
Parselmouths could send snakes on extended complex missions. And if
that was true, then Parselmouths had to <em>make snakes
persistently intelligent</em> by talking to them. In the worst-case
scenario that would make the snake self-aware, like what Harry had
accidentally done to the Sorting Hat.</p>
<p>And when Harry had offered <em>that</em> hypothesis, Draco had
claimed that he could remember a story - Harry hoped to Cthulhu
that <em>this one</em> story was just a fairy tale, it had that
ring to it, but there <em>was</em> a story - about Salazar
Slytherin sending a brave young viper on a mission to <em>gather
information from other snakes.</em></p>
<p>If any snake a Parselmouth had talked to, could make
<em>other</em> snakes self-aware by talking to <em>them,</em>
then...</p>
<p>Then...</p>
<p>Harry didn't even know why his mind was going all "then...
then..." when he knew perfectly well how the exponential
progression would work, it was just the sheer moral horror of it
that was blowing his mind.</p>
<p>And what if someone had invented a spell like that to talk to
cows?</p>
<p>What if there were Poultrymouths?</p>
<p>Or for that matter...</p>
<p>Harry froze in sudden realization just as the forkful of carrots
was about to enter his mouth.</p>
<p><em>That couldn't, couldn't possibly be true, surely no wizard
would be stupid enough to do THAT...</em></p>
<p>And Harry knew, with a dreadful sinking feeling, that <em>of
course</em> they would be that stupid. Salazar Slytherin had
probably never considered the moral implications of snake
intelligence for even one second, just like it hadn't ever occurred
to Salazar that <em>Muggleborns</em> were intelligent enough to
deserve personhood rights. Most people just didn't see moral issues
at all unless someone else was pointing them out...</p>
<p>"Harry?" said Terry from beside him, sounding like he was afraid
he would regret asking. "Why are you staring at your fork like
that?"</p>
<p>"I'm starting to think magic should be illegal," said Harry. "By
the way, have you ever heard any stories about wizards who could
speak with plants?"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Terry hadn't heard of anything like that.</p>
<p>Neither had any seventh-year Ravenclaws that Harry had
asked.</p>
<p>And now Harry had returned to his place, but not yet sat down
again, staring at his plate of vegetables with a forlorn
expression. He was getting hungrier, and later in the day he would
be visiting Mary's Place for one of their incredibly tasty
dishes... Harry was finding himself sorely tempted to just revert
back to yesterday's eating habits and be done with it.</p>
<p><em>You've got to eat something,</em> said his inner Slytherin.
<em>And it's not all that much</em> more <em>likely that anyone
sneezed self-awareness onto poultry than onto plants, so as long as
you're eating food of questionable sentience either way, why not
eat the delicious deep-fried Diracawl slices?</em></p>
<p><em>I'm not quite sure that's valid utilitarian logic, there
-</em></p>
<p><em>Oh, you want utilitarian logic? One serving of utilitarian
logic coming up: Even in the unlikely chance that some moron</em>
did <em>manage to confer sentience on chickens, it's</em> your
<em>research that stands the best chance of discovering the fact
and doing something about it. If you can complete your work even
slightly faster by</em> not <em>messing around with your diet,
then, counterintuitive as it may seem, the</em> best <em>thing you
can do to save the greatest number of possibly-sentient
who-knows-whats is</em> not <em>wasting time on wild guesses about
what might be intelligent. It's not like the house elves haven't
prepared the food already, regardless of what you take onto your
plate.</em></p>
<p>Harry considered this for a moment. It was a rather seductive
line of reasoning -</p>
<p><em>Good!</em> said Slytherin. <em>I'm glad you see now that the
most moral thing to do is to sacrifice the lives of sentient beings
for your own convenience, to feed your dreadful appetites, for the
sick pleasure of ripping them apart with your teeth -</em></p>
<p><em>What?</em> Harry thought indignantly. <em>Which side are
you</em> on <em>here?</em></p>
<p>His inner Slytherin's mental voice was grim. <em>You too will
someday embrace the doctrine... that the end justifies the
meats.</em> This was followed by some mental snickering.</p>
<p>Ever since Harry had started worrying that plants might also be
sentient, his non-Ravenclaw components had been having trouble
taking his moral caution seriously. Hufflepuff was shouting
<em>Cannibalism!</em> every time Harry tried to think about any
food item whatsoever, and Gryffindor would visualize it screaming
while he ate it, even if it was, say, a sandwich -</p>
<p><em>Cannibalism!</em></p>
<p><em>AIIIEEEE DON'T EAT ME -</em></p>
<p><em>Ignore the screams, eat it anyway! It's a safe place to
compromise your ethics in the service of higher goals,
everyone</em> else <em>thinks it's okay to eat sandwiches so you
can't use your usual rationalization about a small probability of a
large downside if you get caught -</em></p>
<p>Harry gave a mental sigh, and thought, <em>Just so long as
you're okay with</em> us <em>being eaten by giant monsters that
didn't do enough research into whether</em> we <em>were
sentient.</em></p>
<p><em>I'm okay with that,</em> said Slytherin. <em>Is everyone
else okay with that?</em> (Internal mental nods.) <em>Great, can we
go back to deep-fried Diracawl slices now?</em></p>
<p><em>Not until I've done some more research into what's sentient
and what isn't. Now shut up.</em> And Harry turned firmly away from
his plate full of oh-so-tempting vegetables to head toward the
library -</p>
<p><em>Just eat the students,</em> said Hufflepuff. <em>There's no
doubt about whether</em> they're <em>sentient.</em></p>
<p><em>You know you want to,</em> said Gryffindor. <em>I bet the
young ones are the tastiest.</em></p>
<p>Harry was starting to wonder if the Dementor had somehow damaged
their imaginary personalities.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"<em>Honestly</em>," said Hermione. The young girl's voice
sounded a little acerbic as her gaze scanned the bookshelves of the
Herbology stacks in the Hogwarts library. Harry had left her a
message asking if she could come to the library after she'd
finished breakfast, which Harry had skipped; but then when Harry
had introduced the day's topic she'd seemed a bit nonplussed. "You
know your problem, Harry? You've got no sense of priorities. An
idea gets into your head and you just go running straight off after
it."</p>
<p>"I've got a <em>great</em> sense of priorities," said Harry. His
hand reached out and grabbed <em>Vegetable Cunning</em> by Casey
McNamara, and began to flip through the starting pages, searching
for the table of contents. "That's why I want to find out whether
plants can talk <em>before</em> I eat my carrots."</p>
<p>"Don't you think that maybe the two of us have more
<em>important</em> things to worry about?"</p>
<p><em>You sound just like Draco,</em> Harry thought, but of course
didn't say out loud. Out loud he said, "What could
<em>possibly</em> be more important than plants turning out to be
sentient?"</p>
<p>There was a pregnant silence from beside him, as Harry's eyes
went down the table of contents. There was indeed a chapter on
Plant Language, causing Harry's heart to skip a beat; and then his
hands began to rapidly turn the pages, heading for the appropriate
page number.</p>
<p>"There are days," said Hermione Granger, "when I really, truly,
have absolutely no idea what goes on inside that head of
yours."</p>
<p>"Look, it's a question of multiplication, okay? There's a
<em>lot</em> of plants in the world, if they're <em>not</em>
sentient then they're not important, but if plants <em>are</em>
people then they've got more moral weight than all the human beings
in the world put together. Now, of course your brain doesn't
realize that on an intuitive level, but that's because the brain
can't multiply. Like if you ask three separate groups of Canadian
households how much they'll pay to save two thousand, twenty
thousand, or two hundred thousand birds from dying in oil ponds,
the three groups will respectively state that they're willing to
pay seventy-eight, eighty-eight, and eighty dollars. No difference,
in other words. It's called scope insensitivity. Your brain
imagines a single bird struggling in an oil pond, and that image
creates some amount of emotion that determines your willingness to
pay. But no one can visualize even two thousand of anything, so the
<em>quantity</em> just gets thrown straight out the window. Now try
to <em>correct</em> that bias with respect to a <em>hundred
trillion</em> sentient blades of grass, and you'll realize that
this could be thousands of times more important than we used to
think the whole human species was... oh thank Azathoth, this says
it's just mandrakes that can talk and they speak regular human
language out loud, not that there's a spell you can use to talk
with <em>any</em> plant -"</p>
<p>"Ron came to me at breakfast yesterday morning," Hermione said.
Now her voice sounded a little quiet, a little sad, maybe even a
little scared. "He said he'd been dreadfully shocked to see me kiss
you. That what you said while you were Demented should've shown me
how much evil you were hiding inside. And that if I was going to be
a follower of a Dark Wizard, then he wasn't sure he wanted to be in
my army anymore."</p>
<p>Harry's hands had stopped turning pages. It seemed that Harry's
brain, for all its abstract knowledge, was still incapable of
appreciating scope on any real emotional level, because it had just
forcibly redirected his attention away from trillions of
possibly-sentient blades of grass who might be suffering or dying
even as they spoke, and toward the life of a single human being who
happened to be nearer and dearer.</p>
<p>"Ron is the world's most gigantic prat," Harry said. "They won't
be printing that in the newspaper anytime soon, because it's not
news. So after you fired him, how many of his arms and legs did you
break?"</p>
<p>"I tried to tell him it wasn't like that," Hermione went on in
the same quiet voice. "I tried to tell him <em>you</em> weren't
like that, and that it wasn't like that between the two of us, but
it just seemed to make him even more... more like he was."</p>
<p>"Well, yes," Harry said. He was surprised that he wasn't feeling
angrier at Captain Weasley, but his concern for Hermione seemed to
be overriding that, for now. "The more you try to justify yourself
to people like that, the more it acknowledges that they have the
<em>right</em> to question you. It shows you think they get to be
your inquisitor, and once you grant someone that sort of power over
you, they just push more and more." This was one of Draco Malfoy's
lessons which Harry had thought was actually pretty smart: people
who <em>tried</em> to defend themselves got questioned over every
little point and could never satisfy their interrogators; but if
you made it clear from the start that you were a celebrity and
above social conventions, people's minds wouldn't bother tracking
most violations. "That's why when Ron came over to <em>me</em> as I
was sitting down at the Ravenclaw table, and told me to stay away
from you, I held my hand out over the floor and said, 'You see how
high I'm holding my hand? Your intelligence has to be at least this
high to talk to me.' Then he accused me of, quote, sucking you into
the darkness, unquote, so I pursed my lips and went
<em>schluuuuurp</em>, and after that his mouth was still making
those talking noises so I put up a Quieting Charm. I don't think
he'll be trying his lectures on me again."</p>
<p>"I understand why you did that," Hermione said, her voice tight,
"I <em>wanted</em> to tell him off too, but I really wish you
hadn't, it will make things harder for <em>me,</em> Harry!"</p>
<p>Harry looked up from <em>Vegetable Cunning</em> again, he wasn't
getting any reading done at this rate; and he saw that Hermione was
still reading whatever book she had, not looking up at him. Her
hands turned another page even as he watched.</p>
<p>"I think you're taking the wrong approach by trying to defend
yourself at all," Harry said. "I really do think that. You are who
you are. You're friends with whoever you choose. Tell anyone who
questions you to shove it."</p>
<p>Hermione just shook her head, and turned another page.</p>
<p>"Option two," Harry said. "Go to Fred and George and tell them
to have a little talk with their wayward brother, <em>those</em>
two are genuine good guys -"</p>
<p>"It's not just Ron," Hermione said in almost a whisper. "Lots of
people are saying it, Harry. Even Mandy is giving me worried looks
when she thinks I'm not looking. Isn't it funny? I keep worrying
that Professor Quirrell is sucking <em>you</em> into the darkness,
and now people are warning me just the same way I try to warn
you."</p>
<p>"Well, <em>yeah,</em>" said Harry. "Doesn't that reassure you a
bit about me and Professor Quirrell?"</p>
<p>"In a word," said Hermione, "no."</p>
<p>There was a silence that lasted long enough for Hermione to turn
another page, and then her voice, in a real whisper this time,
"And, and Padma is going around telling everyone that, that since I
couldn't cast the P-Patronus Charm, I must only be p-pretending to
be n-nice..."</p>
<p>"Padma didn't even <em>try</em> herself!" Harry said
indignantly. "If you <em>were</em> a Dark Witch who was just
pretending, you wouldn't have <em>tried</em> in front of everyone,
do they think you're <em>stupid?</em> "</p>
<p>Hermione smiled a little, and blinked a few times.</p>
<p>"Hey, <em>I</em> have to worry about <em>actually</em> going
evil. <em>Here</em> the worst case scenario is that people think
you're more evil than you really are. Is that going to kill you? I
mean, is it all <em>that</em> bad?"</p>
<p>The young girl nodded, her face screwed up tight.</p>
<p>"Look, Hermione... if you worry that much about what other
people think, if you're unhappy whenever other people don't picture
you exactly the same way you picture yourself, that's
<em>already</em> dooming yourself to always be unhappy. No one ever
thinks of us just the same way we think of ourselves."</p>
<p>"I don't know how to explain to you," Hermione said in a sad
soft voice. "I'm not sure it's something you could ever understand,
Harry. All I can think of to say is, how would you feel if
<em>I</em> thought you were evil?"</p>
<p>"Um..." Harry visualized it. "Yeah, that <em>would</em> hurt. A
lot. But you're a good person who thinks about that sort of thing
intelligently, you've <em>earned</em> that power over me, it would
<em>mean</em> something if you thought I'd gone wrong. I can't
think of a single other student, besides you, whose opinion I'd
care about the same way -"</p>
<p>"You can live like that," whispered Hermione Granger. "I
can't."</p>
<p>The girl had gone through another three pages in silence, and
Harry had returned his eyes to his own book and was trying to
regain his focus, when Hermione finally said, in a small voice,
"Are you really sure I mustn't know how to cast the Patronus
Charm?"</p>
<p>"I..." Harry had to swallow a sudden lump in his throat. He
suddenly saw himself <em>not</em> knowing why the Patronus Charm
didn't work for him, <em>not</em> being able to show Draco, just
being told that there was a reason, and nothing more. "Hermione,
your Patronus would shine with the same light but it wouldn't be
<em>normal,</em> it wouldn't look like people think Patronuses
should look, anyone who saw it would know there was something
strange going on. Even if I told you the secret you couldn't
<em>demonstrate</em> to anyone, unless you made them face the other
way so they could only see the light, and... and the most important
part of any secret is the knowledge that a secret exists, you could
only show one or two friends if you swore them to secrecy..."
Harry's voice trailed off helplessly.</p>
<p>"I'll take it." Her voice was still small.</p>
<p>It was very hard not to just blurt out the secret, right there
in the library.</p>
<p>"I, I shouldn't, I <em>really</em> shouldn't, it's
<em>dangerous,</em> Hermione, it could do a lot of harm if that
secret got out! Haven't you heard the saying, three can keep a
secret if two are dead? That telling just your closest friends is
the same as telling everyone, because you're not just trusting
them, you're trusting everyone they trust? It's too important, too
much of a risk, it's not the sort of decision that should be made
for the sake of fixing someone's reputation at school!"</p>
<p>"Okay," Hermione said. She closed the book and put it back on
the shelf. "I can't concentrate right now, Harry, I'm sorry."</p>
<p>"If there's <em>anything</em> else I can do -"</p>
<p>"Be nicer to everyone."</p>
<p>The girl didn't look back as she walked out of the stacks, which
might have been a good thing, because the boy was frozen in place,
unmoving.</p>
<p>After a while, the boy started turning pages again.</p>
</div>
<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 49: Prior Information<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>A boy waits at a small clearing at the edge of the non-forbidden
forest, beside a dirt trail that runs back to the gates of Hogwarts
in one direction, and off into the distance in another. There is a
carriage nearby, and the boy is standing well away from it, looking
at it, his eyes seldom wavering from its direction.</p>
<p>In the distance, a figure is approaching along the dirt path: A
man wearing professorial robes, trudging slowly with his shoulders
slumped low, his formal shoes kicking up small clouds of dust as he
walks.</p>
<p>Half a minute later, the boy darts another quick glance before
returning to his surveillance; and this glimpse shows that the
man's shoulders have straightened, his face unslackened, and that
his shoes are now walking lightly across the dirt, leaving not a
trace of dust in the air behind.</p>
<p>"Hello, Professor Quirrell," Harry said without letting his eyes
move again from the direction of their carriage.</p>
<p>"Salutations," said the calm voice of Professor Quirrell. "You
seem to be keeping your distance, Mr. Potter. I don't suppose you
see something odd about our conveyance?"</p>
<p>"Odd?" Harry echoed. "Why no, I can't say I see anything odd.
There seem to be even numbers of everything. Four seats, four
wheels, two huge skeletal winged horses..."</p>
<p>A skin-wrapped skull turned to look at him and flashed teeth,
solid and white in that black cavernous mouth, as though to
indicate that it was just about as fond of him as he was of it. The
other black leathery horse-skeleton tossed its head like it was
whickering, but there was no sound.</p>
<p>"They are Thestrals, and they have always drawn the carriage,"
Professor Quirrell said, sounding quite undisturbed as he climbed
into the front bench of the carriage, sitting down as far to the
right as possible. "They are visible only to those who have seen
death and comprehended it, a useful defense against most animal
predators. Hm. I suppose that the first time you went in front of
the Dementor, your worst memory proved to be the night of your
encounter with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?"</p>
<p>Harry nodded grimly. It was the right guess, even if for the
wrong reasons. <em>Those who have seen Death...</em></p>
<p>"Did you recall anything of interest, thereby?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said, "I did," only that and nothing more, for he
was not ready as yet to make accusations.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor smiled one of his dry smiles, and beckoned
with an impatient finger.</p>
<p>Harry closed the distance and climbed into the carriage,
wincing. The sense of doom had grown significantly stronger after
the day of the Dementor, even though it had been slowly weakening
before then. The greatest distance that the carriage allowed him
from Professor Quirrell no longer seemed like nearly far
enough.</p>
<p>Then the skeletal horses trotted forward and the carriage
started in motion, taking them toward the outer bounds of Hogwarts.
As it did, Professor Quirrell slumped back down into zombie-mode,
and the sense of doom retreated, though it still hovered at the
edge of Harry's perceptions, unignorable...</p>
<p>The forest scrolled by as the carriage rolled along, the trees
moving past at a speed that seemed positively glacial by comparison
to broomsticks or even cars. There was something oddly relaxing,
Harry thought, about traveling that slowly. It had certainly
relaxed the Defense Professor, who was slumped over with a small
stream of drool coming out of his slack mouth and puddling on his
robes.</p>
<p>Harry still hadn't decided what he was allowed to eat for
lunch.</p>
<p>His library research hadn't turned up any sign of wizards
speaking to nonmagical plants. Or any other nonmagical animals
besides snakes, although <em>Spell and Speak</em> by Paul Breedlove
had recounted the probably-mythical tale of a sorceress called the
Lady of Flying Squirrels.</p>
<p>What Harry <em>wanted</em> to do was ask Professor Quirrell. The
problem was that Professor Quirrell was <em>too smart</em>. Judging
by what Draco had said, the Heir of Slytherin business was a major
bombshell, and Harry wasn't sure he wanted anyone else to know. And
the instant Harry asked about Parseltongue, Professor Quirrell
would fix him with those pale blue eyes and say, 'I see, Mr.
Potter, so you taught Mr. Malfoy the Patronus Charm and
accidentally spoke to his snake.'</p>
<p>It wouldn't <em>matter</em> that it shouldn't be enough evidence
to locate the true explanation as a hypothesis, let alone overcome
its burden of prior improbability. Somehow the Defense Professor
would deduce it <em>anyway</em>. There were times when Harry
suspected that Professor Quirrell had way more background
information than he was telling, his priors were simply too good.
Sometimes he got his amazing deductions right even when his
<em>reasons</em> were wrong. The problem was that Harry couldn't
see how Professor Quirrell could've snuck in an extra clue about
half the stuff he guessed. Just <em>once</em> Harry would have
liked to make some sort of incredible deduction from something
Professor Quirrell said which would catch <em>him</em> completely
off guard.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"I shall have a bowl of green lentil soup, with soy sauce,"
Professor Quirrell said to the waitress. "And for Mr. Potter, a
plate of Tenorman's family chili."</p>
<p>Harry hesitated in sudden dismay. He'd resolved to stick to
vegetarian dishes for the moment, but he'd forgotten in his
deliberations that Professor Quirrell did the <em>actual
ordering</em> - and it would be awkward if he protested now -</p>
<p>The waitress bowed to them, and turned to go -</p>
<p>"Erm, excuse me, any meat in that from snakes or flying
squirrels?"</p>
<p>The waitress didn't so much as blink an eye, only turned back to
Harry, shook her head, bowed politely to him again, and resumed her
walk toward the door.</p>
<p>(The other parts of Harry were snickering at him. Gryffindor was
making sardonic comments about how a little social discomfort was
enough to get him to resort to <em>Cannibalism!</em> (shouted by
Hufflepuff), and Slytherin was remarking on how nice it was that
Harry's ethics were flexible when it came to important goals like
maintaining his relationship with Professor Quirrell.)</p>
<p>After the waitress had closed the door behind her, Professor
Quirrell waved a hand to slide home the locking bar, spoke the
usual four Charms to ensure privacy, and then said, "An interesting
question, Mr. Potter. I wonder why you asked it?"</p>
<p>Harry kept his face steady. "I was looking up some facts about
the Patronus Charm earlier," he said. "According to <em>The
Patronus Charm: Wizards Who Could and Couldn't,</em> it turns out
that Godric couldn't and Salazar could. I was surprised, so I
looked up the reference, in <em>Four Lives of Power.</em> And
<em>then</em> I discovered that Salazar Slytherin could supposedly
talk to snakes." (Temporal sequence wasn't the same as causation,
it wasn't Harry's fault if Professor Quirrell missed that.)
"Further research turned up an old story about a mother goddess
type who could talk to flying squirrels. I was a bit worried about
the prospect of eating something that could talk."</p>
<p>And Harry took a casual sip of his water -</p>
<p>- just as Professor Quirrell said, "Mr. Potter, would I be
correct in guessing that you are also a Parselmouth?"</p>
<p>When Harry was done coughing, he set his glass of water back
down on the table, fixed his gaze on Professor Quirrell's chin
rather than looking him in the eyes, and said, "So you are able to
perform Legilimency through my Occlumency barriers, then."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was grinning widely. "I shall take that as a
compliment, Mr. Potter, but no."</p>
<p>"I'm not buying this anymore," Harry said. "There's no
<em>way</em> you came to that conclusion based on that
evidence."</p>
<p>"Of course not," Professor Quirrell said equably. "I had planned
to ask you that question today in any case, and simply chose an
opportune moment. I have suspected since December, in fact -"</p>
<p>"<em>December?</em> " said Harry. "I found out
<em>yesterday!</em> "</p>
<p>"Ah, so you did not realize the Sorting Hat's message to you was
in Parseltongue?"</p>
<p>The Defense Professor had timed it exactly right the second
time, too, just as Harry was taking a gulp of water to clear out
his throat from the first coughing fit.</p>
<p>Harry <em>hadn't</em> realized, not until just now. Of course it
was obvious the instant Professor Quirrell said it. Right,
Professor McGonagall had even <em>told</em> him not to talk to
snakes where anyone could see him, but he'd thought she'd meant not
to be seen talking to any statues or architectural features in
Hogwarts that looked like snakes. Double illusion of transparency,
he'd thought he understood her, she'd thought he understood her -
but <em>how</em> the <em>hell -</em></p>
<p>"So," Harry said, "you performed Legilimency on me during my
first Defense class, to find out what happened with the Sorting Hat
-"</p>
<p>"Then I would not have found out in December." Professor Quirell
leaned back, smiling. "This is not a puzzle you can solve on your
own, Mr. Potter, so I will reveal the answer. Over the winter
holiday, I was alerted to the fact that the Headmaster had filed a
request for a closed judicial panel to review the case of one Mr.
Rubeus Hagrid, whom you know as the Keeper of Keys and Grounds at
Hogwarts, and who was accused of the murder of Abigail Myrtle in
1943."</p>
<p>"Oh, of course," said Harry, "that makes it downright
<em>obvious</em> that I'm a Parselmouth. Professor, <em>what</em>
the sweet slithering snakes -"</p>
<p>"The <em>other</em> suspect for that murder was Slytherin's
Monster, the legendary inhabitant of Slytherin's Chamber of
Secrets. Which is why certain sources alerted me to the fact, and
why it caught my attention sufficiently that I spent a good deal of
bribe money to learn the details of the case. Now in point of fact,
Mr. Potter, Mr. Hagrid is innocent. Ridiculously obviously
innocent. He is the most blatantly innocent bystander to be
convicted by the magical British legal system since Grindelwald's
Confunding of Neville Chamberlain was pinned on Amanda Knox.
Headmaster Dippet prompted a student puppet to accuse Mr. Hagrid
because Dippet needed a scapegoat to take the blame for the death
of Miss Myrtle, and our marvelous justice system agreed that this
was plausible enough to warrant Mr. Hagrid's expulsion and the
snapping of his wand. Our current Headmaster needs merely provide
some new item of evidence significant enough to reconvene the case;
and with Dumbledore applying pressure instead of Dippet, the result
is a foregone conclusion. Lucius Malfoy has no particular reason to
fear Mr. Hagrid's vindication; thus Lucius Malfoy will only resist
to the extent that he can do so costlessly in order to impose costs
on Dumbledore, and Dumbledore is clearly willing to prosecute the
case regardless."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell took a sip of his water. "But I digress. The
new evidence that the Headmaster promises to provide is to exhibit
a previously undetected spell on the Sorting Hat, which, the
Headmaster asserts, he has personally determined to respond only to
Slytherins who are also Parselmouths. The Headmaster further argues
that this favors the interpretation that the Chamber of Secrets was
indeed opened in 1943, approximately the right time frame for
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, a known Parselmouth, to have attended
Hogwarts. It is a rather questionable logic, but a judicial panel
may rule that it swings the case far enough to bring Mr. Hagrid's
guilt into doubt, if they can manage to keep a straight face as
they say it. And now we come to the key question: <em>how</em> did
the Headmaster discover this hidden spell on the Sorting Hat?"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was smiling thinly now. "Well now, let us
suppose that there was a Parselmouth in this year's crop of
students, a potential Heir of Slytherin. You must admit, Mr.
Potter, that you stand out as a possibility whenever extraordinary
people are considered. And if I then further ask myself which new
Slytherin would be most likely to have his mental privacy invaded
by the Headmaster, specifically hunting the memories of his
Sorting, why, you stand out even more." The smile vanished. "So you
see, Mr. Potter, it was not <em>I</em> who invaded your mind,
though I will not ask you to apologize. It is not your fault that
you believed Dumbledore's protestations of respecting your mental
privacy."</p>
<p>"My sincere apologies," Harry said, keeping his face
expressionless. The rigid control was a confession in its own
right, as was the sweat beading his forehead; but he didn't think
the Defense Professor would take any evidence from that. Professor
Quirrell would just think Harry was nervous at having been
discovered as the Heir of Slytherin. Rather than being nervous that
Professor Quirrell might realize that Harry had deliberately
betrayed Slytherin's secret... which itself was no longer seeming
like such a smart move.</p>
<p>"So, Mr. Potter. Any progress on finding the Chamber of
Secrets?"</p>
<p><em>No,</em> thought Harry. But to maintain plausible
deniability, you needed a general policy of sometimes evading
questions even when you had nothing to hide... "With respect,
Professor Quirrell, if I had made such progress, it is not
<em>quite</em> obvious to me that I should tell you about it."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell sipped from his own waterglass again. "Well
then, Mr. Potter, I shall freely tell you what I know or suspect.
First, I believe the Chamber of Secrets is real, as is Slytherin's
Monster. Miss Myrtle's death was not discovered until hours after
her demise, even though the wards should have alerted the
Headmaster instantly. Therefore her murder was performed either by
Headmaster Dippet, which is unlikely, or by some entity which
Salazar Slytherin keyed into his wards at a higher level than the
Headmaster himself. Second, I suspect that contrary to popular
legend, the purpose of Slytherin's Monster was <em>not</em> to rid
Hogwarts of Muggleborns. Unless Slytherin's Monster were powerful
enough to defeat the Headmaster of Hogwarts and all the teachers,
it could not triumph by force. Multiple murders in secrecy would
result in the school's closure, as nearly happened in 1943, or in
the placing of new wards. So why Slytherin's Monster, Mr. Potter?
What true purpose does it serve?"</p>
<p>"Ah..." Harry dropped his gaze to his waterglass and tried to
think. "To kill anyone who got into the Chamber and didn't belong
there -"</p>
<p>"A monster powerful enough to defeat a team of wizards that had
broken past the best wards Salazar could place on his Chamber?
Unlikely."</p>
<p>Harry was feeling a bit pressured now. "Well, it's called the
Chamber of Secrets, so maybe the Monster has a secret, or
<em>is</em> a secret?" For that matter, just what sort of secrets
were in the Chamber of Secrets in the first place? Harry hadn't
done a lot of research on the subject, in part because he'd gotten
the impression that nobody knew anything -</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was smiling. "Why not just write the secret
down?"</p>
<p>"Ahhh..." said Harry. "Because if the Monster spoke
Parseltongue, that would ensure that only a true descendant of
Slytherin could hear the secret?"</p>
<p>"Easy enough to key the wards on the Chamber to a phrase spoken
in Parseltongue. Why go to the trouble of creating Slytherin's
Monster? It cannot have been easy to create a creature with a
lifespan of centuries. Come, Mr. Potter, it should be obvious; what
are the secrets that can be told from one living mind to another,
but never written down?"</p>
<p>Harry saw it then, with a burst of adrenaline that started his
heart racing, his breath coming faster. "<em>Oh.</em>"</p>
<p>Salazar Slytherin had been very cunning indeed. Cunning enough
to come up with a way to bypass the Interdict of Merlin.</p>
<p>Powerful wizardries couldn't be transmitted through books or
ghosts, but if you could create a long-lived enough sentient
creature with a good enough memory -</p>
<p>"It seems very probable to me," said Professor Quirrell, "that
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named began his climb to power with secrets
obtained from Slytherin's Monster. That Salazar's lost knowledge is
the source of You-Know-Who's extraordinarily powerful wizardry.
Hence my interest in the Chamber of Secrets and the case of Mr.
Hagrid."</p>
<p>"I <em>see</em>," Harry said. And if <em>he,</em> Harry, could
find Salazar's Chamber of Secrets... then all of the lost knowledge
that Lord Voldemort had obtained would be <em>his</em> as well.</p>
<p>Yes. That was <em>just</em> how the story should go.</p>
<p>Add in Harry's superior intelligence and some original magical
research and some Muggle rocket launchers, and the resulting fight
would be completely one-sided, which was exactly how Harry wanted
it.</p>
<p>Harry was grinning now, a very evil grin. <em>New priority: Find
everything in Hogwarts that looks remotely like a snake and try
speaking to it. Starting with everything you've already tried, only
this time be sure to use Parseltongue instead of English - get
Draco to let you into the Slytherin dorms -</em></p>
<p>"Don't become too excited, Mr. Potter," said Professor Quirrell.
His own face had become expressionless, now. "You must
<em>continue</em> thinking. What were the Dark Lord's parting words
to Slytherin's Monster?"</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " Harry said. "How could either of us possibly
know that?"</p>
<p>"Visualize the scene, Mr. Potter. Let your imagination fill in
the details. Slytherin's Monster - probably some great serpent, so
that only a Parselmouth may speak to it - has finished imparting
all of the knowledge it possesses to He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. It
conveys to him Salazar's final benediction, and warns him that the
Chamber of Secrets must now remain closed until the next descendant
of Salazar should prove cunning enough to open it. And he who will
become the Dark Lord nods, and says to it -"</p>
<p>"Avada Kedavra," said Harry, suddenly feeling sick to his
stomach.</p>
<p>"Rule Twelve," Professor Quirrell said quietly. "Never leave the
source of your power lying around where someone else can find
it."</p>
<p>Harry's gaze dropped to the tablecloth, which had decorated
itself in a mournful pattern of black flowers and shadows. Somehow
that seemed... too sad to be imagined, Slytherin's great snake had
only wanted to help Lord Voldemort, and Lord Voldemort had just...
there was something unbearably sorrowful about it, what sort of
person would <em>do</em> that to a being who'd offered them nothing
but friendship... "<em>Do</em> you think the Dark Lord would have
-"</p>
<p>"Yes," Professor Quirrell said flatly. "He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
left quite a trail of bodies behind him, Mr. Potter; I doubt he
would have omitted that one. If there were any artifacts left there
that could be moved, the Dark Lord would have taken those with him
as well. There might still be something worth seeing in the Chamber
of Secrets, and to find it would prove yourself the true Heir of
Slytherin. But do not raise your hopes too high. I suspect that all
you will find is the remains of Slytherin's Monster resting quietly
in its grave."</p>
<p>They sat in silence for a while.</p>
<p>"I could be wrong," said Professor Quirrell. "In the end it is
only a guess. But I did wish to warn you, Mr. Potter, so that you
would not be too sorely disappointed."</p>
<p>Harry nodded shortly.</p>
<p>"One might even regret your infant self's victory," said
Professor Quirrell. His smile twisted. "If only You-Know-Who had
lived, you might have persuaded him to teach you some of the
knowledge that would have been your heritage, from one Heir of
Slytherin to another." The smile twisted further, as though to mock
the obvious impossibility, even given the premise.</p>
<p><em>Note to self,</em> thought Harry, with a slight chill and an
edge of anger, <em>make sure to extract my heritage out of the Dark
Lord's mind, one way or another.</em></p>
<p>There was another silence. Professor Quirrell was looking at
Harry as though waiting for him to ask something.</p>
<p>"Well," said Harry, "so long as we're on the topic, can I ask
how you think the whole Parselmouth business actually -"</p>
<p>There came a knock at the door, then. Professor Quirrell raised
a cautionary finger, then opened the door with a wave. The waitress
entered, balancing a huge platter with their meals as though the
whole assembly weighed nothing (which was in fact probably the
case). She gave Professor Quirrell his bowl of green soup, and a
glass of his usual Chianti; and set down before Harry a plate of
small meat strips smothered in a heavy-looking sauce, plus a glass
of his accustomed treacle soda. Then she bowed, managing to make it
seem like sincere respect rather than perfunctory acknowledgment,
and departed.</p>
<p>When she was gone, Professor Quirrell held up a finger for
silence again, and drew his wand.</p>
<p>And then Professor Quirrell began performing a certain series of
incantations that Harry recognized, making him take a sharp breath.
It was the series and ordering that Mr. Bester had used, the full
set of twenty-seven spells that you would perform before discussing
anything of truly great import.</p>
<p>If the discussion of the Chamber of Secrets <em>hadn't</em>
counted as important -</p>
<p>When Professor Quirrell was done - he'd performed
<em>thirty</em> spells, three of which Harry hadn't heard before -
the Defense Professor said, "Now we shall not be interrupted for a
time. Can you keep a secret, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>Harry nodded.</p>
<p>"A serious secret, Mr. Potter," Professor Quirrell said. His
eyes were intent, his face grave. "One which could potentially send
me to Azkaban. Think about it before you reply."</p>
<p>For a moment Harry didn't even see why the question should be
hard, given his growing collection of secrets. Then -</p>
<p><em>If this secret could send Professor Quirrell to Azkaban,
that means he's done something illegal...</em></p>
<p>Harry's brain performed a few calculations. Whatever the secret,
Professor Quirrell did not think his illegal act would reflect
badly on him in Harry's eyes. There was no advantage to be gained
from <em>not</em> hearing it. And if it did reveal something wrong
with Professor Quirrell, then it was very much to Harry's advantage
to know it, even if he had promised not to tell anyone.</p>
<p>"I never had very much respect for authority," Harry said.
"Legal and governmental authority included. I will keep your
secret."</p>
<p>Harry didn't bother asking whether the revelation was worth the
danger it would pose to Professor Quirrell. The Defense Professor
wasn't stupid.</p>
<p>"Then I must test whether you are truly a descendant of
Salazar," said Professor Quirrell, and stood up from his chair.
Harry, prompted more by reflex and instinct than calculation,
shoved himself up out of his own chair as well.</p>
<p>There was a blur, a shift, a sudden motion.</p>
<p>Harry aborted his panicked backward leap halfway through,
leaving him windmilling his arms and trying not to fall over, a
frantic flush of adrenaline running through him.</p>
<p>At the other end of the room swayed a snake a meter high, bright
green and intricately banded in white and blue. Harry didn't know
enough snakelore to recognize it, but he knew that 'brightly
colored' meant 'poisonous'.</p>
<p>The constant sense of doom had diminished, ironically enough,
after the Defense Professor of Hogwarts had turned into a venomous
snake.</p>
<p>Harry swallowed hard and said, "Greetings - ah, hssss, no, ah,
<em>greetingss.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Sso,</em>" hissed the snake. "<em>You sspeak, I hear. I
sspeak, you hear?</em> "</p>
<p>"<em>Yess, I hear,</em>" hissed Harry. "<em>You are an
Animaguss?</em> "</p>
<p>"<em>Obvioussly,</em>" hissed the snake. "<em>Thirty-sseven
ruless, number thirty-four: Become Animaguss. All ssensible people
do, if can. Thuss,</em> <em>very rare.</em>" The snake's eyes were
flat surfaces ensconced within dark pits, sharp black pupils in
dark gray fields. "<em>This iss mosst ssecure way to sspeak. You
ssee? No otherss undersstand uss.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Even if they are ssnake Animagi?</em> "</p>
<p>"<em>Not unlesss heir of Sslytherin willss.</em>" The snake gave
a series of short hisses which Harry's brain translated as sardonic
laughter. "<em>Sslytherin not sstupid. Ssnake Animaguss not ssame
as Parsselmouth. Would be huge flaw in sscheme.</em>"</p>
<p>Well <em>that</em> definitely argued that Parseltongue was
personal magic, not snakes being sentient beings with a learnable
language -</p>
<p>"<em>I am not regisstered,</em>" hissed the snake. The dark pits
of its eyes stared at Harry. "<em>Animaguss musst be regisstered.
Penalty is two yearss imprissonment. Will you keep my ssecret,
boy?</em> "</p>
<p>"<em>Yess,</em>" hissed Harry. "<em>Would never break
promisse.</em>"</p>
<p>The snake seemed to hold still, as though in shock, and then
began to sway again. "<em>We come here next in sseven dayss. Bring
cloak to passs unsseen, bring hourglasss to move through time
-</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>You know?</em> " hissed Harry in shock. "<em>How
-</em>"</p>
<p>Again the series of short quick hisses that translated as
sardonic laughter. "<em>You arrive in my firsst classs while sstill
in other classs, sstrike down enemy with pie, two ballss of memory
-</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Never mind,</em>" hissed Harry. "<em>Sstupid question,
forgot you were ssmart.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Foolissh thing to forget,</em>" said the snake, but the
hiss did not seem offended.</p>
<p>"<em>Hourglasss is resstricted,</em>" Harry said. "<em>Cannot
usse until ninth hour.</em>"</p>
<p>The snake twitched its head, a snakish nod. "<em>Many
resstrictionss. Locked to your usse only, cannot be sstolen. Cannot
transsport other humanss. But ssnake carried in pouch, I ssuspect
will go with. Think posssible to hold hourglasss motionlesss within
sshell, without dissturbing wardss, while you turn sshell around
it. We will tesst in sseven dayss. Will not sspeak of planss beyond
thiss. You ssay nothing, to no one. Give no ssign of expectancy,
none. Undersstand?</em> "</p>
<p>Harry nodded.</p>
<p>"<em>Ansswer in sspeech.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Yess.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Will do as I ssaid?</em> "</p>
<p>"<em>Yess. But,"</em> Harry gave a wobbling rasp that was how
his mind had translated a hesitant 'Ahhh' into snakish, "<em>I do
not promisse to do whatever thiss iss, you have not ssaid
-</em>"</p>
<p>The snake performed a shiver that Harry's mind translated as a
severe glare. "<em>Of coursse not. Will disscusss sspecificss at
next meeting.</em>"</p>
<p>The blur and motion reversed itself, and Professor Quirrell was
standing there once more. For a moment the Defense Professor
himself seemed to sway, as the snake had swayed, and his eyes
seemed cold and flat; and then his shoulders straightened and he
was human once more.</p>
<p>And the aura of doom had returned.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's chair scooted back for him, and he sat down
in it. "No sense in letting this go to waste," Professor Quirrell
said as he picked up his spoon, "though at the moment I would much
prefer a live mouse. One can never quite disentangle the mind from
the body it wears, you see..."</p>
<p>Harry slowly took his seat and began eating.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"So the line of Salazar did not die with You-Know-Who after
all," said Professor Quirrell after a time. "It would seem that
rumors have already begun to spread, among our fine student body,
that you are Dark; I wonder what they would think, if they knew
that."</p>
<p>"Or if they knew that I had destroyed a Dementor," Harry said,
and shrugged. "I figure all the fuss will blow over over the next
time I do something interesting. Hermione is having trouble,
though, and I was wondering if you might have any suggestions for
her."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor ate several spoonfuls of soup in silence,
then; and when he spoke again, his voice was oddly flat. "You
really care about that girl."</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said quietly.</p>
<p>"I suppose that is why she was able to bring you out of your
Dementation?"</p>
<p>"More or less," Harry said. The statement was true in a way,
just not exact; it was not that his Demented self had cared, but
that it had been confused.</p>
<p>"I did not have any friends like that when I was young." Still
the same emotionless voice. "What would have become of you, I
wonder, if you had been alone?"</p>
<p>Harry shivered before he could stop himself.</p>
<p>"You must be feeling grateful to her."</p>
<p>Harry just nodded. Not quite exact, but true.</p>
<p>"Then here is what I might have done at your age, if there had
been anyone to do it for -"</p>
</div>
<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 50: Self Centeredness<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>Padma Patil had finished her dinner a little late, getting on
toward seven-thirty, and was now striding quickly out of the Great
Hall on her way to the Ravenclaw dorm and the study rooms.
Gossiping was fun and destroying Granger's reputation was more fun,
but it could distract from schoolwork. She'd put off a six-inch
essay on <em>lomillialor</em> wood due in next morning's Herbology
class, and she needed to finish it tonight.</p>
<p>It was while she was passing through a long, twisting, narrow
stone corridor that the whisper came, sounding like it was coming
from right behind her.</p>
<p>"<em>Padma Patil...</em>"</p>
<p>She spun around quick as lightning, her wand already snatched up
from a pocket of her robes and leaping into her hands, if Harry
Potter thought he could sneak up on and scare <em>her</em> that
easily -</p>
<p>There was no one there.</p>
<p>Instantly Padma spun around and looked in the other direction,
if it had been a Ventriloquism Charm -</p>
<p>There was no one there, either.</p>
<p>The whispering sigh came again, soft and dangerous with a slight
hissing undertone.</p>
<p>"<em>Padma Patil, Slytherin girl...</em>"</p>
<p>"Harry Potter, Slytherin boy," she said out loud.</p>
<p>She'd fought Potter and his Chaos Legion a dozen times over, and
she <em>knew</em> that this was Harry Potter doing this
somehow...</p>
<p>...even though the Ventriloquism Charm was only line-of-sight,
and in the winding corridor, she could easily see all the way to
the nearest twist both forward and backward, and there was no one
there...</p>
<p>...it didn't matter. She knew her enemy.</p>
<p>There was a whispery chuckle, now coming from beside her, and
she spun around and pointed her wand at the whisper and shouted
"<em>Luminos!</em> "</p>
<p>The red bolt of light shot out and struck the wall, which lit
with a crimson glow that soon faded.</p>
<p>She hadn't really expected it to work. Harry Potter couldn't
<em>possibly</em> be invisible, not really invisible, that was
magic most <em>grownups</em> couldn't do, and she'd never believed
nine-tenths of the stories about him.</p>
<p>The whispery voice laughed again, now on her other side.</p>
<p>"Harry Potter stands on the precipice," whispered the voice, now
sounding very close to her ear, "he is wavering, but you, you are
already falling, Slytherin girl..."</p>
<p>"The hat never called out Slytherin for <em>my</em> name,
Potter!" She backed up against the wall, so she wouldn't have to
watch behind herself, and raised her wand in an attack stance.</p>
<p>Again the soft laugh. "Harry Potter has been in the Ravenclaw
common room for the last half-hour, helping Kevin Entwhistle and
Michael Corner rehearse Potions recipes. But it matters not. I am
here to deliver a warning to you, Padma Patil, and if you choose to
ignore it, that is your own affair."</p>
<p>"Fine," she said coldly. "Go ahead and warn me, Potter, I'm not
afraid of you."</p>
<p>"Slytherin was a great House, once," said the whisper; it
sounded sadder, now. "Slytherin was once a House you would have
been proud to choose, Padma Patil. But something turned wrong,
something turned sour; do you know what went awry in Slytherin
House, Padma Patil?"</p>
<p>"No, and I don't care!"</p>
<p>"But you should care," said the whisper, now sounding like it
was coming from just behind her head where it stood almost pressed
against the wall. "For you are still that girl whom the Sorting Hat
offered that choice. Do you think that just choosing Ravenclaw
means that you are not Pansy Parkinson, and will not ever become
Pansy Parkinson, no matter how you conduct yourself otherwise?"</p>
<p>Despite everything, now, small chills of fear were spreading out
from her spine and running over her skin. She'd heard
<em>those</em> stories about Harry Potter too, that he was a secret
Legilimens. But she still stood straight, and she put all the bite
she could into her voice when she said, "The Slytherins went Dark
to get power, just like <em>you</em> did, Potter. And <em>I</em>
won't, not ever."</p>
<p>"But you'll spread vicious rumors about an innocent girl,"
whispered the voice, "even though it will not help you attain any
of your own ambitions, and without considering that she has
powerful allies who might take offense. That is not the proud
Slytherin of the old days, Padma Patil, that is not the pride of
Salazar, that is Slytherin gone rotten, Padma Parkinson not Padma
Malfoy..."</p>
<p>She was getting more creeped out than she ever had been in her
life, and the possibility was starting to occur to her that this
might <em>really</em> be a ghost. She hadn't ever heard that ghosts
could hide themselves like this, but maybe they just didn't usually
do it - not to mention that most ghosts weren't this
<em>eerie,</em> they were just dead people after all - "Who
<em>are</em> you? The Bloody Baron?"</p>
<p>"When Harry Potter was bullied and beaten," the voice whispered,
"he commanded all his allies to refrain from vengeance; do you
remember that, Padma Patil? For Harry Potter is wavering, but not
yet lost; he is struggling, he knows himself to be in peril. But
Hermione Granger made no such request of her own allies. Harry
Potter is angered with you now, Padma Patil, more angered than he
would ever be on his own behalf... and <em>he</em> has allies of
his own."</p>
<p>A shudder went through her, she knew that it was visible and she
hated herself for it.</p>
<p>"Oh, don't be afraid," breathed the voice. "I will not hurt you.
For you see, Padma Patil, Hermione Granger truly is innocent.
<em>She</em> does not stand on the precipice, <em>she</em> is not
falling. She did not ask her allies to refrain from hurting you,
because the thought did not even occur to her as a possibility. And
Harry Potter knows very well that if he hurt you or caused you to
be hurt, for Hermione Granger's sake, then she would never speak to
him again until the Sun burned low and the last star failed in the
night sky." The voice was very sad now. "She truly is a kindly
girl, a person such as I could only wish to be..."</p>
<p>"Granger can't cast the Patronus Charm!" said Padma. "If she was
really as nice as she pretends to be -"</p>
<p>"Can <em>you</em> cast the Patronus Charm, Padma Patil? You
dared not even attempt it, you feared what the result would
be."</p>
<p>"That's not <em>true!</em> I didn't have time, that was
all!"</p>
<p>The whisper continued. "But Hermione Granger did try, openly
before her friends, and when her magic failed she was surprised and
dismayed. For there are secrets to the Patronus Charm that few ever
knew, and maybe none now know but I." A soft, whispery chuckle.
"Let it stand that it is no stain of her spirit that halts her
light from coming forth. Hermione Granger cannot cast the Patronus
Charm for the very same reason that Godric Gryffindor, who raised
these halls, never could."</p>
<p>The corridor <em>was</em> becoming colder, she was certain of
it, as though someone were using the Chilling Charm.</p>
<p>"And Harry Potter is not Hermione Granger's only ally." Now
there was an undertone of dry amusement in that whisper, it
reminded her suddenly and frighteningly of Professor Quirrell.
"Filius Flitwick and Minerva McGonagall are quite fond of her, I do
believe. Did it occur to you that if those two learned what you
were doing to Hermione Granger, they might become less fond of you?
They might not intervene openly, perhaps; but they might be a
little slower to award you House Points, a little slower to steer
opportunities your way -"</p>
<p>"Potter <em>snarked</em> on me?"</p>
<p>A ghostly chuckle, a dry heh-heh-heh. "Do you think those two
are stupid, deaf and blind?" In a sadder whisper, "Do you think
Hermione Granger is not precious to them, that they will not see
her hurting? As they might have been fond of you once, their bright
young Padma Patil, but you are throwing it away..."</p>
<p>Padma's throat was dry. She hadn't thought of that, not at
all.</p>
<p>"I wonder how many people will end up caring for you, Padma
Patil, on this path that you now tread. Is it worth that much, just
to distance yourself further from your sister? To be the shadow to
Parvati's light? Your deepest fear has always been to fall into
harmony with her, <em>back</em> into harmony with her I should say;
but is it worth hurting an innocent girl, just to make yourself
that much more different? Must you be the <em>evil</em> twin, Padma
Patil, can you not find a different good to pursue?"</p>
<p>Her heart was hammering in her chest. She'd, she'd never talked
about that with <em>anyone -</em></p>
<p>"I have always wondered at how students bully each other,"
sighed the voice. "How children make life difficult for themselves,
how they turn their schools into prisons even with their own hands.
Why do human beings make their own lives so unpleasant? I can give
you a part of the answer, Padma Patil. It is because people do not
stop and think before causing pain, if they do not imagine that
they themselves could also be hurt, that they might also suffer
from their own misdeeds. But suffer you will, oh, yes, Padma Patil,
suffer you will, if you stay on this road. You will suffer the same
pain of loneliness, the same pain of others' fear and distrust,
that you now inflict on Hermione Granger. Only for you it will be
deserved."</p>
<p>Her wand was shaking in her hand.</p>
<p>"You did not choose sides when you went to Ravenclaw, girl. You
choose your side by the way you live your life, what you do to
other people and what you do to yourself. Will you illuminate
others' lives, or darken them? That is the choice between Light and
Dark, not any word the Sorting Hat cries out. And the hard part,
Padma Patil, is not saying 'Light', the hard part is deciding which
is which, and admitting it to yourself when you begin down the
wrong road."</p>
<p>There was silence. It went on for a time, and Padma realized
that she had been dismissed.</p>
<p>Padma almost dropped her wand, when she tried to put it back
into her pocket. She almost fell, when she took a step forward away
from the wall, and turned to go -</p>
<p>"I have not always chosen rightly between Light and Dark," the
whisper said, now loud and harsh directly into her ear. "Do not
take my wisdom as a final word, girl, do not fear to question it,
for though I tried I have sometimes failed, oh, yes, I have failed.
But you are hurting a true innocent, and you will achieve none of
your ambitions by doing so, it is not for any cunning plan. You are
inflicting pain purely for the sake of the pleasure it brings you.
I have not always chosen rightly between Light and Dark, but that I
know for darkness, for certain. You are hurting an innocent girl,
and escaping retribution only because she is too kindly to tolerate
her allies moving against you. I cannot hurt you for that, so know
only that I cannot respect it. You are unworthy of Slytherin; go
and do your Herbology homework, Ravenclaw girl!"</p>
<p>The final whisper came out in a louder hiss that sounded almost
like a snake, and Padma fled, she fled down the corridors like
Lethifolds were chasing her, she ran heedless of the rules about
running in the corridors, even when she passed other students who
looked at her in surprise, she did not stop, she ran all the way to
the Ravenclaw dorms with her pulse pounding in her neck, the door
asked her "Why does the Sun shine in the day instead of the
nighttime?" and it took her three tries before she could make her
answer coherent, and then the door came open and she saw -</p>
<p>- a few girls and boys, some young and some old, all staring at
her, and in one corner at the pentagonal table, Harry Potter and
Michael Corner and Kevin Entwhistle, looking up from their
textbooks.</p>
<p>"Sweet Merlin!" exclaimed Penelope Clearwater, rising from a
couch. "What happened to you, Padma?"</p>
<p>"I," she stuttered, "I, I heard - a ghost -"</p>
<p>"It wasn't the Bloody Baron, was it?" said Clearwater. She drew
her wand and a moment later she was holding a cup, and then an
<em>Aguamenti</em> later the cup was filled with water. "Here,
drink this, sit down -"</p>
<p>Padma was already striding toward the pentagonal table. She
looked at Harry Potter, who was looking at her with his own gaze,
calm and grave and a little sad.</p>
<p>"<em>You</em> did this!" Padma said. "How - you - how dare
you!"</p>
<p>There was a sudden hush in the Ravenclaw dorm.</p>
<p>Harry just looked at her.</p>
<p>And said, "Is there anything I can help you with?"</p>
<p>"Don't deny it," Padma said, her voice shaking, "<em>you</em>
set that ghost on me, it <em>said</em> -"</p>
<p>"I mean it," Harry said. "Can I help you with anything? Get you
some food, or go fetch a soda for you, or help you with your
homework, or anything like that?"</p>
<p>Everyone was staring at the two of them.</p>
<p>"Why?" Padma said. She couldn't think of anything else to say,
she didn't understand.</p>
<p>"Because some of us are standing on the precipice," Harry said.
"And the difference is what you do for other people. Will you let
me help you with something, Padma, please?"</p>
<p>She stared at him, and knew, in that moment, that he'd gotten
his own warning, same as her.</p>
<p>"I..." she said. "I've got to write six inches on
<em>lomillialor</em> -"</p>
<p>"Let me run up to my dorm room and get my Herbology stuff,"
Harry said. He rose from the pentagonal table, looked at Entwhistle
and Corner. "Sorry, guys, I'll see you later."</p>
<p>They didn't say anything, just stared, along with everyone else
in the dorm room, as Harry Potter walked over to the stairs.</p>
<p>And just as he started up, he said, "And no one's to pester her
with questions unless <em>she</em> wants to talk about it, I hope
everyone's <em>got that?</em> "</p>
<p>"Got it," said most of the first years and some of the older
students, a few of them sounding quite scared.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>And she talked about a lot of things with Harry Potter besides
<em>lomillialor</em> wood - even her fear of falling back into
harmony with Parvati, which she'd never talked about with
<em>anyone</em> before, but then Harry's ghostly ally already knew.
And Harry had reached into his pouch and pulled out some
<em>odd</em> books, loaning them to her on condition of complete
secrecy, saying that if she could comprehend those books it would
change the pattern of her thinking enough that she'd never fall
into harmony with Parvati again...</p>
<p>At nine o' clock, when Harry said he had to go, the essay was
only half done.</p>
<p>And when Harry paused, and looked at her on the way out, and
said that <em>he</em> thought she was worthy of Slytherin, it made
her feel good for a whole minute before she realized what had just
been said to her and who had said it.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>When Padma got down to breakfast, that morning, she saw Mandy
see her and whisper something to the girl sitting beside her at the
Ravenclaw table.</p>
<p>She saw that girl get up from the bench and walk toward her.</p>
<p>Last night Padma had been glad that girl roomed in the other
dorm; but now that she thought about it, this was worse, now she
had to do it in front of <em>everyone</em>.</p>
<p>But even though Padma was sweating, she knew what she had to
do.</p>
<p>The girl came closer -</p>
<p>"I'm sorry."</p>
<p>"What?" said Padma. That was <em>her</em> line.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," repeated Hermione Granger. Her voice was loud so
that everyone could hear. "I... I didn't ask Harry to do that, and
I was angry with him when I found out, and I made him promise not
to do it again to <em>anyone</em>, and I'm not talking to him for a
week... I'm really, <em>really</em> sorry, Miss Patil."</p>
<p>Hermione Granger's back was stiff, her face was stiff, you could
see the sweat on her face.</p>
<p>"Um," said Padma. Her own thoughts were pretty much scrambled,
now...</p>
<p>Padma's gaze flicked to the Ravenclaw table, where one boy was
watching them with tight eyes and his hands clenched in his
lap.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Earlier:</em></p>
<p>"I told you to be <em>nicer!</em> " shrieked Hermione.</p>
<p>Harry was starting to sweat. He'd never actually heard Hermione
scream at him before, and it was quite loud in the empty
classroom.</p>
<p>"I - but - but I <em>was</em> nice!" Harry protested. "I
practically <em>redeemed</em> her, Padma was going down the wrong
path and I turned her off it! I probably changed her whole life to
be happier! Besides, you should've heard the <em>original</em>
version of what Professor Quirrell suggested I do -" at which point
Harry realized what he was saying and closed his mouth a second too
late.</p>
<p>Hermione clutched at her chestnut curls, a gesture Harry hadn't
seen from her before. "What'd <em>he</em> say to do? <em>Kill</em>
her?"</p>
<p>The Defense Professor had suggested that Harry identify all the
key influential students inside and outside his year and try to
gain control of the entire Hogwarts rumor mill, remarking that this
was a generally useful and amusing challenge for any true Slytherin
attending Hogwarts.</p>
<p>"Nothing like <em>that,</em>" Harry said quickly, "he just said
in a general way that I should get influence over the people
spreading rumors, and <em>I</em> decided that the <em>nice</em>
version of that would be to just inform Padma directly about the
meaning of what she was doing, and the possible consequences of her
actions, instead of trying to threaten her or anything like that
-"</p>
<p>"<em>You call that not threatening someone?</em> " Hermione's
hands were pulling at her hair now.</p>
<p>"Um..." Harry said. "I guess she might've felt a <em>little</em>
threatened, but Hermione, people will do whatever they think they
can get away with, they don't care about how much it hurts other
people if it doesn't hurt themselves, if Padma thinks there's
<em>no</em> consequences to spreading lies about you then of
<em>course</em> she'll just go on doing it -"</p>
<p>"And you think there's going to be no consequences to what
<em>you</em> did?"</p>
<p>Harry got a sudden sick feeling to his stomach.</p>
<p>Hermione had the angriest look on her that he'd ever seen. "What
do you think the other students think of you now, Harry? Of
<em>me?</em> If Harry doesn't like the way you talk about Hermione,
you'll get ghosts set on you, is that what you want them to
think?"</p>
<p>Harry opened his mouth and no words came out, he just... hadn't
thought about it that way, actually...</p>
<p>Hermione reached down to grab her books from the table where
she'd slammed them. "I'm not talking to you for a week, and I'll
<em>tell</em> everyone I'm not talking to you for a week, and I'll
tell them <em>why</em>, and <em>maybe</em> that'll undo some of
what you just did. And after that week, I'll - I'll decide then
what to do, I guess -"</p>
<p>"<em>Hermione!</em> " Harry's own voice rose to a shriek of
desperation. "<em>I was trying to help!</em> "</p>
<p>The girl turned back and looked at him as she opened the
classroom door.</p>
<p>"Harry," she said, and her voice trembled a little beneath the
anger, "Professor Quirrell is sucking you into the darkness, he
really is, I mean it, Harry."</p>
<p>"This... wasn't him, this wasn't what he said to do, this was
just <em>me</em> -"</p>
<p>Hermione's voice was almost a whisper now. "Someday you're going
to go out to lunch with him, and it will be your dark side that
comes back, or maybe even you won't come back at all."</p>
<p>"I promise you," Harry said, "that I <em>will</em> come back
from lunch."</p>
<p>He wasn't even thinking as he said it.</p>
<p>And Hermione just turned around and strode out and slammed the
door behind her.</p>
<p><em>Way to invoke the laws of dramatic irony, moron,</em>
observed Harry's Internal Critic. <em>Now you're going to die this
Saturday, your last words will be 'I'm sorry, Hermione', and she'll
always regret that the last thing she did was slam the door
-</em></p>
<p><em>Oh, shut up.</em></p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>When Padma sat down with Hermione for breakfast, and said in a
voice loud enough for others to hear that the ghost had just told
her things that were important for her to hear, and Harry Potter
had been right to do it, there were some people who were less
frightened afterward, and some who were frightened more.</p>
<p>And afterward people <em>did</em> say fewer nasty things about
Hermione, at least in the first year, at least in public where
Harry Potter might hear about it.</p>
<p>When Professor Flitwick asked Harry if he was responsible for
what had happened to Padma, and Harry said yes, Professor Flitwick
told him that he was to serve two days' detention. Even if it had
only been a ghost and Padma hadn't been hurt, still, that wasn't
acceptable behavior for a Ravenclaw student. Harry nodded and said
that he understood why the Professor had to do that, and wouldn't
protest; but considering that it <em>did</em> seem to have turned
Padma around, did Professor Flitwick really think, off the record,
that he'd done the wrong thing? And Professor Flitwick paused,
seeming to actually think about it, and then said to Harry, in a
solemnly squeaky voice, that he needed to learn how to relate to
other students the normal way.</p>
<p>And Harry couldn't help but think that this was advice that
Professor Quirrell would never give him.</p>
<p>Harry couldn't help but think that if he'd done it Professor
Quirrell's way, the normal <em>Slytherin</em> way, a mixture of
positive and negative incentives to bring Padma and the other
rumor-mongers under his explicit control, then Padma wouldn't have
talked about it, and Hermione would have never found out...</p>
<p>...in which case Padma wouldn't have been redeemed, she would
have stayed on the wrong path, and she herself would have suffered
from that eventually. It wasn't as if Harry had <em>lied</em> to
Padma in any way, when he was Time-Turned and invisible and using
the Ventriloquism Charm.</p>
<p>Harry still wasn't sure whether he'd done the right thing, or
<em>a</em> right thing, and Hermione hadn't relented on not talking
to him - though she was talking a lot with Padma. It hurt more than
Harry had expected, going back to studying by himself; like his
brain had already started to forget its long-honed skill of being
alone.</p>
<p>The days until Saturday's lunch with Professor Quirrell seemed
to go by very, very slowly.</p>
</div>
<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 47: Personhood Theory<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>There comes a point in every plot where the victim starts to
suspect; and looks back, and sees a trail of events all pointing in
a single direction. And when that point comes, Father had
explained, the prospect of the loss may seem so unbearable, and
admitting themselves tricked may seem so humiliating, that the
victim will yet deny the plot, and the game may continue long
after.</p>
<p>Father had warned Draco not to do that again.</p>
<p>First, though, he'd let Mr. Avery finish eating all of the
cookies he'd swindled from Draco, while Draco watched and cried.
The whole lovely jar of cookies that Father had given him just a
few hours earlier, for Draco had lost all of them to Mr. Avery,
down to the very last one.</p>
<p>So it was a familiar feeling that Draco had felt in the pit of
his stomach, when Gregory told him about The Kiss.</p>
<p>Sometimes you looked back, and saw things...</p>
<p>(In a lightless classroom - you couldn't quite call it
<em>unused</em> any more, since it'd seen weekly use over the last
few months - a boy sat enshrouded in a hooded cowl, with an
unlighted crystal globe on the desk in front of him. Thinking in
silence, thinking in darkness, waiting for an opening door to let
in the light.)</p>
<p>Harry had shoved Granger away and said, <em>I told you, no
kissing!</em></p>
<p>Harry would probably say something like, <em>She just did it to
annoy me, last time, just like she made me go on that
date.</em></p>
<p>But the verified story was that Granger had been willing to face
the Dementor again in order to help Harry; that she had kissed
Harry, crying, when he was lost in the depths of Dementation; and
that her kiss had brought him back.</p>
<p>That didn't sound like rivalry, even friendly rivalry.</p>
<p>That sounded like the kind of friendship you usually didn't see
even in plays.</p>
<p>Then why had Harry made his friend climb the icy walls of
Hogwarts?</p>
<p>Because that was the sort of thing Harry Potter did to his
friends?</p>
<p>Father had told Draco that to fathom a strange plot, one
technique was to look at what <em>ended up</em> happening, assume
it was the <em>intended</em> result, and ask who benefited.</p>
<p>What had ended up happening as the result of Draco and Granger
fighting Harry Potter together... was that Draco had started to
feel a lot friendlier toward Granger.</p>
<p>Who benefited from the scion of Malfoy becoming friends with a
mudblood witch?</p>
<p>Who benefited, that was famous for exactly that sort of
plot?</p>
<p>Who benefited, that could possibly be pulling Harry Potter's
strings?</p>
<p>Dumbledore.</p>
<p>And if that was true then Draco would <em>have</em> to go to
Father and tell him everything, no matter what happened after that,
Draco couldn't imagine what would happen after that, it was awful
beyond imagining. Which made him want to cling desperately to the
last shred of hope that it wasn't all what it looked like...</p>
<p>...Draco remembered that, too, from Mr. Avery's lesson.</p>
<p>Draco hadn't planned to confront Harry yet. He was still trying
to think of an experimental test, something that Harry wouldn't
just see through and fake. But then Vincent had come with the
message that Harry wanted to meet early this week, on Friday
instead of Saturday.</p>
<p>And so here Draco was, in a dark classroom, an unlit crystal
globe on his desk, waiting.</p>
<p>Minutes passed.</p>
<p>Footsteps approached.</p>
<p>The door made a gentle creak as it swung open into the
classroom, revealing Harry Potter dressed in his own hood and cowl;
Harry stepped forward into the dark classroom, and the sturdy door
closed behind him with a faint click.</p>
<p>Draco tapped the crystal globe, and the classroom lit with
bright green light. Green light projected shadows of the desks onto
the floor, and glared back at him from the curved chair-backs,
photons bouncing off the wood in such fashion that the angle of
incidence equaled the angle of reflection.</p>
<p>At least <em>that</em> much of what he'd learned wasn't likely
to be a lie.</p>
<p>Harry had flinched as the light went on, halting for a moment,
then resumed his approach. "Hello, Draco," Harry said quietly,
drawing back his hood as he came to Draco's desk. "Thank you for
coming, I know it's not our usual time -"</p>
<p>"You're welcome," Draco said flatly.</p>
<p>Harry dragged one of the chairs to face Draco across his desk,
the legs making a slight screeching sound on the floor. He spun the
chair so that it was facing the wrong way, and sat down straddling
it, his arms folded across the back of the chair. The boy's face
was pensive, frowning, serious, looking very adult even for Harry
Potter.</p>
<p>"I have an important question to ask you," said Harry, "but
there's something else I want us to do before that."</p>
<p>Draco said nothing, feeling a certain weariness. Part of him
just wanted it all to be over with already.</p>
<p>"Tell me, Draco," said Harry. "Why don't Muggles ever leave
ghosts behind when they die?"</p>
<p>"Because Muggles don't have souls, obviously," Draco said. He
didn't even realize until after he'd said it that it might
contradict Harry's politics, and then he didn't care. Besides, it
<em>was</em> obvious.</p>
<p>Harry's face showed no surprise. "Before I ask my important
question, I want to see if you can learn the Patronus Charm."</p>
<p>For a moment the sheer nonsequitur stumped Draco. Good old
impossible-to-predict-or-understand Harry Potter. There were times
when Draco wondered whether Harry was deliberately this
disorienting as a tactic.</p>
<p>Then Draco understood, and shoved himself up and away from his
desk in a single angry motion. That was it. It was over. "Like
<em>Dumbledore's</em> servants," he spat.</p>
<p>"Like Salazar Slytherin," Harry said steadily.</p>
<p>Draco almost stumbled over his own feet in the middle of his
first stride toward the door.</p>
<p>Slowly, Draco turned back toward Harry.</p>
<p>"I don't know where you came up with that," said Draco, "but
it's wrong, everyone knows the Patronus Charm is a Gryffindor spell
-"</p>
<p>"Salazar Slytherin could cast a corporeal Patronus Charm," Harry
said. Harry's hand darted into his robes, brought out a book whose
title was written as white on green, and so almost impossible to
read in the green light; but it looked old. "I discovered that when
I was researching the Patronus Charm before. And I found the
original reference and checked the book out of the library just in
case you didn't believe me. The author of this book doesn't think
there's anything <em>unusual</em> about Salazar being able to cast
a Patronus, either; the belief that Slytherins can't do that must
be recent. And as a further historical note, though I don't have
the book with me, Godric Gryffindor never could."</p>
<p>After the first six times Draco had tried calling Harry's bluff,
on six successively more ridiculous occasions, he'd realized that
Harry just <em>didn't</em> lie about what was written in books.
Still, when Harry's hands opened the book and laid it out to the
place of a bookmark, Draco leaned over and studied the place where
Harry's finger pointed.</p>
<p><em>Then the fires of Ravenclaw fell upon the darkness that had
cloaked the left wing of Lord Foul's army, breaking it, and it was
revealed that the Lord Gryffindor had spoken true; the fear they
all had felt was not natural in its source, but coming from thrice
a dozen Dementors, who had been promised the souls of the defeated.
At once the Lady Hufflepuff and Lord Slytherin brought forth their
Patronuses, a vast angry badger and a bright silver serpent, and
the defenders lifted their heads as the shadow passed from their
hearts. And Lady Ravenclaw laughed, remarking that Lord Foul was a
great fool, for now his own army would be subject to the fear, but
not the defenders of Hogwarts. Yet the Lord Slytherin said, "No
fool he, that much I know." And the Lord Gryffindor beside him
studied the battlefield with a frown upon his face...</em></p>
<p>Draco looked back up. "So?"</p>
<p>Harry closed the book and put it into his pouch. "Chaos and
Sunshine both have soldiers that can cast corporeal Patronus
Charms. Corporeal Patronuses can be used to convey messages. If you
can't learn the spell, Dragon Army will be at a severe military
disadvantage -"</p>
<p>Draco didn't care about that right now, and told Harry so. His
voice was sharper than it probably should have been.</p>
<p>Harry didn't blink. "Then I'm calling in the favor you owe me
from that time I stopped a riot from breaking out, on our first day
of broomstick lessons. I'm going to try to teach you the Patronus
Charm, and for my favor, I want you to do your honest best to learn
and cast it. I trust to the honor of House Malfoy that you
will."</p>
<p>Draco felt that certain weariness again. If Harry had asked at
any other time, it would have been a fair return on favor owed,
given that it wasn't actually a Gryffindor spell. But...</p>
<p>"<em>Why?</em> " Draco said.</p>
<p>"To find out whether you can do this thing that Salazar
Slytherin could do," Harry said evenly. "This is an experimental
test, and I will not tell you what it means until after you have
done it. Will you?"</p>
<p>...It probably <em>was</em> a good idea to discharge that favor
on something innocuous, all the more so if it was time to break
with Harry Potter. "All right."</p>
<p>Harry drew a wand from his robes, and laid it against the globe.
"Not really the best color for learning the Patronus Charm," Harry
said. "Green light the exact shade of the Killing Curse, I mean.
But silver is a Slytherin color too, isn't it? <em>Dulak.</em>" The
light went out, and Harry whispered the first two phrases of the
Continual Light enchantment, recasting that part of it, though
neither of them could have cast the whole thing by themselves. Then
Harry tapped the globe again, and the room lit with a silver
radiance, brilliant but still soft and gentle. Color returned to
the desks and chairs, and to Harry's slightly sweaty face beneath
his shock of black hair.</p>
<p>It took that long for Draco to realize the implication. "You saw
a <em>Killing Curse</em> cast since the last time we met? When -
how -"</p>
<p>"Cast the Patronus Charm," Harry said, looking more serious than
ever, "and I'll tell you."</p>
<p>Draco pressed his hands to his eyes, shutting out the silver
light. "You know, I really should remember that you're too
<em>weird</em> for any <em>normal</em> plots!"</p>
<p>Within his self-imposed darkness, he heard the sound of Harry
snickering.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry watched closely as Draco finished his latest run-through
of the preliminary gestures, the part of the spell that was
difficult to learn; the final brandish and the pronunciation didn't
have to be precise. All three of the last runs had been perfect as
far as Harry could see. Harry had also felt an odd impulse to
adjust things that Mr. Lupin hadn't said anything about, like the
angle of Draco's elbow or the direction his foot was pointing; it
could have been entirely his own imagination, and probably was, but
Harry had decided to go with it just in case.</p>
<p>"All right," Harry said quietly. There was a tension in his
chest that made it a little hard to speak. "Now we don't have a
Dementor here, but that's all right. We won't need one. Draco, when
your father spoke to me at the train station, he said that you were
the one thing in the world that was most precious to him, and he
threatened to throw away all his other plans to take vengeance on
me, if ever you came to harm."</p>
<p>"He... what?" There was a catch in Draco's voice, and a strange
look on his face. "Why are you telling me <em>that?</em> "</p>
<p>"Why wouldn't I?" Harry didn't let his expression change, though
he could guess what Draco was thinking; that Harry had been
plotting to separate Draco from his father, and shouldn't be saying
anything that would bring them closer together. "There's always
been just one person who matters most to you, and I know exactly
what warm and happy thought will let you cast the Patronus Charm.
You told it to me at the train station before the first day of
school. Once you fell off a broomstick and broke your ribs. It hurt
more than anything you'd ever felt, and you thought you were going
to die. Pretend that fear is coming from a Dementor, standing in
front of you, wearing a tattered black cloak, looking like a dead
thing left in water. And then cast the Patronus Charm, and when you
brandish the wand to drive the Dementor away, think of how your
father held your hand, so that you wouldn't be afraid; and then
think of how much he loves you, and how much you love him, and put
it all into your voice when you say <em>Expecto Patronum.</em> For
the honor of House Malfoy, and not just because you promised me a
favor. Show me you didn't lie to me that day in the train station
when you told me Lucius was a good father. Show me you can do what
Salazar Slytherin could do."</p>
<p>And Harry stepped backward, behind Draco, out of Draco's field
of vision, so that Draco only faced the dusty old teacher's desk
and blackboard at the front of the unused classroom.</p>
<p>Draco cast one look behind him, that strange look still on his
face, and then turned away to face forward. Harry saw the
exhalation, the inhalation. The wand twitched once, twice, thrice,
and four times. Draco's fingers slid along the wand, exactly the
right distances -</p>
<p>Draco lowered his wand.</p>
<p>"This is too -" Draco said, "I can't <em>think</em> this right,
while you're watching -"</p>
<p>Harry turned around and started walking toward the door. "I'll
come back in a minute," Harry said. "Just hold to your happy
thought, and the Patronus will stay."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>From behind Draco came the sound of the door opening again.</p>
<p>Draco heard Harry's footsteps entering the classroom, but Draco
didn't turn to look.</p>
<p>Harry didn't say anything either. The silence stretched.</p>
<p>Finally -</p>
<p>"What does this <em>mean?</em> " Draco said. His voice wavered a
bit.</p>
<p>"It means you love your father," Harry's voice said. Which was
just what Draco had been thinking, and trying not to cry in front
of Harry. It was too right, just too right -</p>
<p>Before Draco, on the floor, was the shining form of a snake that
Draco recognized; a Blue Krait, a snake first brought to their
manor by Lord Abraxas Malfoy after a visit to some faraway land,
and Father had kept a Blue Krait in the ophidiarium ever since. The
thing about the Blue Krait was that the bite wouldn't hurt much.
Father had said that, and told Draco that he was <em>never</em>
allowed to pet the snake, no matter who was watching. The venom
killed your nerves so fast that you didn't have time to feel pain
as the poison spread. You could die of it even after using Healing
Charms. It ate other snakes. It was as Slytherin as any creature
could possibly be.</p>
<p>That was why a Blue Krait head had been forged into the handle
of Father's cane.</p>
<p>The bright snake darted out its tongue, which was also silver;
and seemed to <em>smile</em> somehow, in a warmer way than any
reptile should.</p>
<p>And then Draco realized -</p>
<p>"But," Draco said, still staring at the beautifully radiant
snake, "<em>you</em> can't cast the Patronus Charm." Now that Draco
had cast it himself, he understood why that was important. You
could be evil, like Dumbledore, and still cast the Patronus Charm,
so long as you had <em>something</em> bright left inside you. But
if Harry Potter didn't have a single thought inside him that shone
like that -</p>
<p>"The Patronus Charm is more complicated than you think, Draco,"
Harry said seriously. "Not everyone who fails at casting it is a
bad person, or even unhappy. But anyway, I <em>can</em> cast it. I
did it on my second try, after I realized what I'd done wrong
facing the Dementor my first time. But, well, my life gets a little
peculiar sometimes, and my Patronus came out strange, and I'm
keeping it a secret for now -"</p>
<p>"Am I supposed to just <em>believe</em> that?"</p>
<p>"You can ask Professor Quirrell if you don't believe me," said
Harry. "Ask him whether Harry Potter can cast a corporeal Patronus,
and tell him that I told you to ask. He'd know the request was from
me, no one else would know."</p>
<p>Oh, and now Draco was to trust <em>Professor Quirrell?</em>
Still, knowing Harry, it might be true; and Professor Quirrell
wouldn't lie for trivial reasons.</p>
<p>The glowing snake turned its head back and forth, as though
seeking a prey that wasn't there, and then coiled itself into a
circle, as though to rest.</p>
<p>"I wonder," Harry said softly, "when it was, which year, which
generation, that Slytherins stopped trying to learn the Patronus
Charm. When it was that people started to think, that Slytherins
themselves started to think, that being cunning and ambitious was
the same as being cold and unhappy. And if Salazar knew that his
students didn't even bother showing up to learn the Patronus Charm
any more, I wonder, would he wish that he'd never been born? I
wonder how it all went wrong, when Slytherin's House went
wrong."</p>
<p>The shining creature winked out, the turmoil rising in Draco
making it impossible to sustain the Charm. Draco spun on Harry, he
had to control himself not to raise his wand. "What do <em>you</em>
know about Slytherin House <em>or</em> Salazar Slytherin?
<em>You</em> were never Sorted into my House, what gives you the
right to -"</p>
<p>And <em>that</em> was when Draco <em>finally</em> realized.</p>
<p>"<em>You did get Sorted into Slytherin!</em> " Draco said. "You
<em>did,</em> and afterwards you, you somehow, you <em>snapped your
fingers -</em>" Draco had once asked Father if it would be cleverer
to get Sorted into some other House so that everyone would trust
him, and Father had smiled and said that he'd thought of that too
at Draco's age, but there was no way to fool the Sorting Hat...</p>
<p>...not until <em>Harry Potter</em> came along.</p>
<p>How had he ever bought for <em>one minute</em> that
<em>Harry</em> was a <em>Ravenclaw?</em></p>
<p>"An interesting hypothesis," Harry said equably. "Do you know,
you're the second person in Hogwarts to come up with a theory along
those lines? At least you're the second that's actually said so to
my face -"</p>
<p>"Snape," Draco said with certainty. His Head of House was no
fool.</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell, <em>of course,</em>" said Harry. "Though
come to think, Severus did ask me how I managed to stay out of his
House, and whether I had something the Sorting Hat wanted. I
suppose you could say you're number three. Oh, but Professor
Quirrell's theory was a little different than yours, though. May I
have your word not to repeat it?"</p>
<p>Draco nodded without even really thinking about it. What was he
supposed to do, say no?</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell thought that Dumbledore wasn't happy with
the Hat's choice for the Boy-Who-Lived."</p>
<p>And the instant Harry said it, Draco knew, he <em>knew</em> that
it was true, it was just <em>obvious</em>. Who did Dumbledore even
think he was fooling?</p>
<p>...well, besides every single other person in Hogwarts except
Snape and Quirrell, Harry might even believe it
<em>himself</em>...</p>
<p>Draco stumbled back over to his desk in something of a daze, and
sat down hard enough to hurt slightly. This sort of thing happened
around once a month with Harry, and it hadn't happened yet in
January, so it was time.</p>
<p>His fellow Slytherin, who might or might not think himself a
Ravenclaw, sat back down in the chair he'd used earlier, now
sitting on it crosswise, and looking up intently at Draco.</p>
<p>Draco didn't know <em>what</em> he should be doing now, whether
he should be trying to persuade the lost Slytherin boy that, no, he
<em>wasn't</em> actually a Ravenclaw... or trying to figure out
whether Harry was in league with Dumbledore, though that suddenly
seemed less likely... but then <em>why</em> had Harry set up the
whole thing with him and Granger...</p>
<p>He really <em>should</em> have remembered that Harry was too
weird for any normal plots.</p>
<p>"Harry," Draco said. "Did you deliberately antagonize me and
General Sunshine just so we'd work together against you?"</p>
<p>Harry nodded without hesitation, as though it was the most
normal thing in the world, and nothing to be ashamed of.</p>
<p>"The whole thing with the gloves and making us climb up the
walls of Hogwarts, the <em>only point</em> was to make me and
Granger more friendly toward each other. And even before then.
You've been plotting it for a really long time. Since the
<em>beginning</em>."</p>
<p>Again the nod.</p>
<p>"<em>WHYYYYY?</em> "</p>
<p>Harry's eyebrows lifted for a moment, the only reaction he
showed to Draco shrieking so loudly in the closed classroom that it
hurt his own ears. WHY, WHY, WHY did Harry Potter <em>DO</em> this
sort of thing...</p>
<p>Then Harry said, "So that Slytherins will be able to cast the
Patronus Charm again."</p>
<p>"<em>That... doesn't... make... SENSE!</em> " Draco was aware
that he was losing control of his voice, but he didn't seem able to
stop himself. "<em>What does that have to do with
Granger?</em> "</p>
<p>"Patterns," Harry said. His face was very serious now, and very
grave. "Like a quarter of children born to Squib couples being
wizards. A simple, unmistakable pattern you would recognize
instantly, if you knew what you were looking at; even though, if
you didn't know, you wouldn't even realize it was a clue. The
poison in Slytherin House is something that's been seen before in
the Muggle world. This is an <em>advance</em> prediction, Draco, I
could have written it down for you before our first day of school,
just from hearing you talk in King's Cross Station. Let me describe
some really pathetic sorts of people that hang around at your
father's political rallies, pureblood families that would never be
invited to dinner at Malfoy Manor. Bearing in mind that
<em>I've</em> never met them, I'm just predicting it from
recognizing the pattern of what's happening to Slytherin House
-"</p>
<p>And Harry Potter proceeded to describe the Parkinsons and
Montagues and Boles with a calmly cutting accuracy that Draco
wouldn't have dared <em>think</em> to himself in case there was a
Legilimens around, it was <em>beyond</em> insult, they would
<em>kill</em> Harry if they ever heard...</p>
<p>"To sum up," Harry finished, "they don't have any power
themselves. They don't have any wealth themselves. If they didn't
have Muggleborns to hate, if all the Muggleborns vanished the way
they say they <em>want</em>, they'd wake up one morning and find
they had <em>nothing.</em> But so long as they can say purebloods
are superior, they can feel superior themselves, they can feel like
part of the master class. Even though your father would never dream
of inviting them to dinner, even though there's not one Galleon in
their vaults, even if they did worse on their OWLs than the worst
Muggleborn in Hogwarts. Even if they can't cast the Patronus Charm
any more. Everything is the Muggleborns' fault to them, they have
someone besides themselves to blame for their own failures, and
that makes them even weaker. That's what Slytherin House is
becoming, <em>pathetic,</em> and the root of the problem is hating
Muggleborns."</p>
<p>"Salazar Slytherin himself said that mudbloods needed to be cast
out! That they were weakening our blood -" Draco's voice had risen
to a shout.</p>
<p>"<em>Salazar was wrong as a question of simple fact!</em> You
<em>know</em> that, Draco! And that <em>hatred</em> is poisoning
your whole House, you couldn't cast the Patronus Charm using a
thought like that!"</p>
<p>"Then why could <em>Salazar Slytherin</em> cast the Patronus
Charm?"</p>
<p>Harry was wiping sweat from his forehead. "Because things have
<em>changed</em> between then and now! Listen, Draco, three hundred
years ago you could find great scientists, as great as Salazar in
their own way, who would have told you that some other Muggles were
inferior because of their skin color -"</p>
<p>"<em>Skin color?</em> " said Draco.</p>
<p>"I know, skin color instead of anything important like blood
purity, isn't it ridiculous? But then something in the world
changed, and <em>now</em> you can't find any great scientists who
still think skin color should matter, only loser people like the
ones I described to you. Salazar Slytherin made the mistake when
everyone else was making it, because he grew up believing it, not
because he was <em>desperate for someone to hate.</em> There were a
few people who did better than everyone else around them, and
<em>they</em> were exceptionally good. But the ones who just
accepted what everyone else thought weren't <em>exceptionally</em>
evil. The sad fact is that most people just don't notice a moral
issue at all unless someone else is pointing it out to them; and
once they're as old as Salazar was when he met Godric, they've lost
the ability to change their minds. Only <em>then</em> Hogwarts was
built, and Hogwarts started sending acceptance letters to
Muggleborns like Godric insisted, and more and more people began to
notice that Muggleborns <em>weren't</em> any different. Now it's a
big political issue instead of something that everyone just
believes without thinking about it. And the <em>correct</em> answer
is that Muggleborns <em>aren't</em> any weaker than purebloods. So
<em>now</em> the people who end up siding with what Salazar once
believed, are either people who grew up in very closed pureblood
environments like you, <em>or</em> people who are so pathetic
themselves that they're desperate for someone to feel superior to,
people who love to hate."</p>
<p>"That doesn't... that doesn't sound right..." Draco's voice
said. His ears listened, and wondered that he couldn't come up with
anything better to say.</p>
<p>"It doesn't? Draco, you <em>know</em> now there's nothing wrong
with Hermione Granger. You had trouble dropping her off a roof, I
hear. Even though you knew she'd taken a Feather-Falling Potion,
even though you knew she was safe. What sort of person do you think
wants to <em>kill</em> her, not for any wrong she did to them, just
because she's a Muggleborn? Even though she's, she's just a young
girl who would help them with their homework in a second, if they
ever asked her," Harry's voice broke, "what sort of person wants
her to <em>die?</em> "</p>
<p><em>Father -</em></p>
<p>Draco felt split in two, he seemed to be having a problem with
dual vision, <em>Granger is a mudblood, she should die</em> and a
girl hanging from his hand on the rooftop, like seeing double,
seeing double -</p>
<p>"And anyone who <em>doesn't</em> want Hermione Granger to die,
won't want to hang around the sort of people who <em>do!</em>
That's all people think Slytherin <em>is</em> now, not clever
planning, not trying to achieve greatness, just hating Muggleborns!
I paid Morag a Sickle to ask Padma why she hadn't gone to
Slytherin, we both know she got the option. And Morag told me that
Padma just gave her a <em>look</em> and said that she wasn't Pansy
Parkinson. You see? The <em>best</em> students with the virtues of
more than one House, the students with <em>choices,</em> they go
under the Hat thinking <em>anywhere but Slytherin,</em> and someone
like Padma ends up in Ravenclaw. And... I think the Sorting Hat
tries to maintain a balance in the Sorting, so it fills out the
ranks of Slytherin with anyone who <em>isn't</em> repelled by all
the hatred. So instead of Padma Patil, Slytherin gets Pansy
Parkinson. She's not very cunning, and she's not very ambitious,
but she's the sort of person who doesn't mind what Slytherin is
turning into. And the more Padmas go to Ravenclaw and the more
Pansies go to Slytherin, the more the process accelerates. <em>It's
destroying Slytherin House, Draco!</em> "</p>
<p>It had a ring of awful truth, Padma <em>had</em> belonged in
Slytherin... and instead Slytherin got Pansy... Father rallied
lesser families like the Parkinsons because they were convenient
sources of support, but Father hadn't realized the
<em>consequences</em> of associating Slytherin's name with
them...</p>
<p>"I can't -" Draco said, but he wasn't even sure what he couldn't
do - "What do you <em>want</em> from me?"</p>
<p>"I'm not sure how to heal Slytherin House," Harry said slowly.
"But I know it's something you and I will end up having to do. It
took centuries for science to dawn over the Muggle world, it only
happened slowly, but the stronger science got, the further that
sort of hatred retreated." Harry's voice was quiet, now. "I don't
know exactly why it worked that way, but that's how it happened
historically. As though there's something in science like the shine
of the Patronus Charm, driving back all sorts of darkness and
madness, not right away, but it seems to follow wherever science
goes. The Enlightenment, that was what it was called in the Muggle
world. It has something to do with seeking the truth, I think...
with being able to change your mind from what you grew up
believing... with thinking <em>logically,</em> realizing that
there's no <em>reason</em> to hate someone because their skin is a
different color, just like there's no reason to hate Hermione
Granger... or maybe there's something to it that even I don't
understand. But the Enlightenment is something that you and I
belong to now, both of us. Fixing Slytherin House is just one of
the things we have to do."</p>
<p>"Let me think," Draco said, his voice coming out in something of
a croak, "please," and he rested his head in his hands, and
thought.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Draco thought for a while, with his palms over his eyes to shut
out the world, no sound but his and Harry's breathing. All the
persuasive reasonableness of what Harry said, the evident grains of
truth that it contained; and against that, the obvious, the
perfectly and entirely obvious hypothesis about what was
<em>really</em> going on...</p>
<p>After a time, Draco finally raised his head.</p>
<p>"It sounds right," Draco said quietly.</p>
<p>A huge smile broke out on Harry's face.</p>
<p>"So," Draco continued, "is this where you bring me to
Dumbledore, to make it official?"</p>
<p>He kept his voice very casual as he said it.</p>
<p>"Oh, yeah," Harry said. "That was the thing I was going to ask
you about, actually -"</p>
<p>Draco's blood froze in his veins, froze solid and shattered
-</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell said something to me that got me thinking,
and, well, no matter how you answer this question, I'm already
stupid for having not asked you a lot earlier. Everyone in
Gryffindor thinks Dumbledore is a saint, the Hufflepuffs think he's
crazy, the Ravenclaws are all proud of themselves for having worked
out that he's only pretending to be crazy, but I never asked anyone
in Slytherin. I'm supposed to know better than to make that sort of
mistake. But if even <em>you</em> think Dumbledore's okay to
conspire with on fixing Slytherin House, I guess I didn't miss
anything important."</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>"You know," Draco said, his voice remarkably calm, all things
considered, "every time I wonder if you do things like this just to
annoy me, I tell myself that it <em>has</em> to be accidental,
<em>no one</em> could possibly do this sort of thing on purpose
even if they tried until blood trickled out of their ears. That's
the only reason I'm not going to strangle you now."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>And then strangle <em>himself,</em> because Harry <em>had</em>
grown up with Muggles, and then Dumbledore had smoothly diverted
him from Slytherin to Ravenclaw, so it was perfectly plausible that
Harry might <em>not</em> know anything, and Draco had never thought
to <em>tell him.</em></p>
<p>Or else Harry had guessed that Draco wouldn't join up with
Dumbledore so readily, and this itself was just the next step of
Dumbledore's plan...</p>
<p>But if Harry <em>really</em> didn't know about Dumbledore, then
warning him had to take precedence over <em>everything.</em></p>
<p>"All right," Draco said, after he'd had a chance to organize his
thoughts. "I don't know where to start, so I'll just start
somewhere." Draco drew a deep breath. This was going to take a
while. "Dumbledore murdered his little sister, and got away with it
because his brother wouldn't testify against him -"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry listened with increasing worry and dismay. Harry had been
prepared, he'd thought, to take the blood purist side of the story
with a grain of salt. The trouble was that even after you added an
enormous amount of salt, it <em>still</em> didn't sound good.</p>
<p>Dumbledore's father had been convicted of using Unforgivable
Curses on children, and died in Azkaban. That was no sin of
Dumbledore's, but it would be a matter of public record. Harry
could check that part, and see whether all of this had been made up
out of thin air by the blood purists.</p>
<p>Dumbledore's mother had died mysteriously, shortly before his
younger sister died in what the Aurors had ruled to be murder.
Supposedly that sister had been brutalized by Muggles and never
spoken again after that; which, Draco pointed out, sounded
remarkably like a botched Obliviation.</p>
<p>After Harry's first few interruptions, Draco had seemed to pick
up on the general principle, and was now presenting the
observations first and the inferences afterward.</p>
<p>"- so you don't have to take my word for it," said Draco, "you
can <em>see</em> it, right? Anyone in Slytherin can. Dumbledore
waited to fight his duel with Grindelwald until the exact moment
when it would look best for Dumbledore, <em>after</em> Grindelwald
had ruined most of Europe and built up a reputation as the most
terrible Dark Wizard in history, and just when Grindelwald had lost
the gold and blood sacrifices he was getting from his Muggle pawns
and was about to start heading downhill. If Dumbledore was really
the noble wizard he pretended to be, he'd have fought Grindelwald
long before that. Dumbledore probably <em>wanted</em> Europe
ruined, it was probably part of their plan together, he only
attacked Grindelwald after his puppet <em>failed</em> him. And that
big flashy duel wasn't real, there's no way two wizards would be so
exactly matched that they'd fight for twenty whole hours until one
of them fell over from exhaustion, that was just Dumbledore making
it look more spectacular." Here Draco's voice became more
indignant. "And that got Dumbledore made <em>Chief Warlock of the
Wizengamot!</em> The Line of Merlin Unbroken, corrupted after
fifteen hundred years! And <em>then</em> he became Supreme Mugwump
on top of that, and he <em>already</em> had Hogwarts to use as an
invincible fortress - Headmaster <em>and</em> Chief Warlock
<em>and</em> Supreme Mugwump, no normal person would try to do all
that at once, <em>how can anyone not see that Dumbledore's trying
to take over the world?</em> "</p>
<p>"Pause," Harry said, and closed his eyes to think.</p>
<p>It wasn't any worse than what you would have heard about the
West in Stalin's Russia, and none of that would have been true.
Though the blood purists wouldn't be able to get away with making
stuff up entirely... or would they? The <em>Daily Prophet</em> had
shown a pronounced tendency to make stuff up... but then again,
when they stuck out their neck too far on the Weasley betrothal,
they <em>had</em> been called on it and they <em>had</em> been
embarrassed...</p>
<p>Harry opened his eyes, and saw that Draco was watching him with
a steady, waiting gaze.</p>
<p>"So when you asked me if it was time to join up with Dumbledore,
that was just a test."</p>
<p>Draco nodded.</p>
<p>"And before that, when you said it sounded right -"</p>
<p>"It <em>sounds</em> right," said Draco. "But I don't know if I
can trust you. Are you going to complain about my <em>testing</em>
you, Mr. Potter? Are you going to say that I <em>fooled</em> you?
That I <em>led you on?</em> "</p>
<p>Harry knew he should smile like a good sport, but he couldn't
really, it was too much of a disappointment.</p>
<p>"You're right, it's fair, I can't complain," Harry said instead.
"So what about He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named? Not as bad as he was made
out to be?"</p>
<p>Draco looked bitter, at that. "So you think it's all just making
Father's side look good and Dumbledore's side look bad, and that I
believe it all myself just because Father told me."</p>
<p>"It's a possibility I'm considering," Harry said evenly.</p>
<p>Draco's voice was low and intense. "They <em>knew</em>. My
father knew, his friends knew. They <em>knew</em> the Dark Lord was
evil. <em>But he was the only chance anyone had against
Dumbledore!</em> The only wizard anywhere who was powerful enough
to fight him! Some of the other Death Eaters were truly evil too,
like Bellatrix Black - Father isn't like that - but Father and his
friends <em>had</em> to do it, Harry, they <em>had</em> to,
Dumbledore was taking over everything, the Dark Lord was the only
hope anyone had left!"</p>
<p>Draco was staring hard at Harry. Harry met the gaze, trying to
think. Nobody ever thought of themselves as the villain of their
own story - maybe Lord Voldemort did, maybe Bellatrix did, but
Draco certainly didn't. That the Death Eaters were bad guys was not
in question. The question was whether they were <em>the</em> bad
guys; whether there was <em>one</em> villain in the story, or
<em>two...</em></p>
<p>"You're not convinced," Draco said. He looked worried, and a
little angry. Which didn't surprise Harry. He was pretty sure Draco
himself believed all this.</p>
<p>"<em>Should</em> I be convinced?" Harry said. He didn't look
away. "Just because you believe it? Are you a strong enough
rationalist now that your belief is strong evidence to me, because
you'd be very unlikely to believe it if it weren't true? When I met
you, you weren't that strong. Everything you told me, did you
rethink it after you awakened as a scientist, or is it just
something you grew up believing? Can you look me in the eyes and
swear to me upon the honor of House Malfoy that if there's one
untruth buried in what you said, one thing that got added on just
to make Dumbledore look a little worse, you would have
noticed?"</p>
<p>Draco started to open his mouth, and Harry said, "Don't. Don't
stain the honor of House Malfoy. You're <em>not</em> that strong
yet, and you should know it. Listen, Draco, I've started to notice
some worrying things myself. But there's nothing <em>definite,</em>
nothing <em>certain,</em> it's all just deductions and hypotheses
and untrustworthy witnesses... And there's nothing certain in your
story, either. Dumbledore might've had some other good reason not
to fight Grindelwald years earlier - though it <em>would</em> have
to be a pretty good excuse, especially considering what was
happening on the Muggle side of things... but still. Is there one
clearly evil thing that Dumbledore's done for <em>certain,</em> so
I don't have to wonder?"</p>
<p>Draco's breathing was harsh. "All right," Draco said in an
uneven voice, "I'll tell you what Dumbledore did." From Draco's
robes came a wand, and Draco said "Quietus", then "Quietus" again,
but he got the pronunciation wrong a second time, and finally Harry
took out his own wand and did it.</p>
<p>"There," said Draco hoarsely, "once upon a time there, there was
a girl, and her name was Narcissa, and she was the prettiest, the
smartest, the most cunning girl that was ever Sorted into
Slytherin, and my father loved her, and they married, and she
wasn't a Death Eater, she wasn't a fighter, <em>all she ever did
was love Father -</em>" Draco stopped there, because he was
crying.</p>
<p>Harry felt sick to his stomach. Draco had never talked about his
<em>mother</em>, not once, he should have noticed that earlier.
"She... got in the way of a curse?"</p>
<p>Draco's voice came out in a scream. "<em>Dumbledore burned her
to death in her own bedroom!</em> "</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>In a classroom filled with soft silver light, one boy is staring
at another boy, who is sobbing, wiping frantically at his eyes with
the sleeves of his robes.</p>
<p>It was hard for Harry to stay balanced, to keep withholding
judgment, it was too emotional, there was something that either
wanted to start tears from his own eyes in sympathy with Draco, or
<em>know</em> that it wasn't true...</p>
<p><em>Dumbledore burned her to death in her own bedroom!</em></p>
<p>That...</p>
<p>...didn't sound like Dumbledore's style...</p>
<p>...but you could only think that thought so many times, before
you started to wonder about the trustworthiness of that whole
'style' concept.</p>
<p>"It, it must have hurt horribly," Draco said, his voice shaking,
"Father never talks about it at all, you don't ever talk about it
in front of him, but Mr. Macnair told me, there were scorch marks
all over the bedroom, from how Mother must have struggled while
Dumbledore <em>burned her alive</em>. That is the debt Dumbledore
owes to House Malfoy and <em>we will have his life for
it!</em> "</p>
<p>"Draco," Harry said, he let all of the hoarseness into his own
voice, it would be <em>wrong</em> to sound calm, "I'm sorry, I'm so
sorry for asking, but I <em>have</em> to know, <em>how</em> do you
know it was Dumble-"</p>
<p>"Dumbledore <em>said</em> he did it, he told Father it was a
<em>warning!</em> And Father couldn't testify under Veritaserum
because he was an Occlumens, he couldn't even get Dumbledore put on
trial, Father's own allies didn't believe him after Dumbledore just
denied everything in public, but we know, the Death Eaters know,
Father wouldn't have any reason to lie about that, Father would
want us to take revenge on the <em>right person,</em> can't you see
that Harry?" Draco's voice was wild.</p>
<p><em>Unless Lucius did it himself, of course, and found it more
convenient to blame Dumbledore.</em></p>
<p>Although... it also didn't seem like <em>Lucius's</em> style.
And if he <em>had</em> murdered Narcissa, it would have been
smarter to pin the blame on an easier victim instead of losing
political capital and credibility by going after Dumbledore...</p>
<p>In time, Draco stopped crying, and looked at Harry.
"<em>Well?</em> " said Draco, sounding like he wanted to spit the
words. "Is that <em>evil</em> enough for you, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>Harry looked down at where his arms rested on the back of his
chair. He couldn't meet Draco's eyes any more, the pain in them was
too raw. "I wasn't expecting to hear that," Harry said softly. "I
don't know what to think any more."</p>
<p>"You <em>don't know?</em> " Draco's voice rose to a shriek, and
he stood up abruptly from his desk -</p>
<p>"I remembered the Dark Lord killing my parents," Harry said.
"When I went in front of the Dementor the first time, that was what
I remembered, the worst memory. Even though it was so long ago. I
heard them dying. My mother begged the Dark Lord not to kill me,
<em>not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead!</em> That's
what she said. And the Dark Lord mocked her, and laughed. Then, I
remember, the flash of green light -"</p>
<p>Harry looked up at Draco.</p>
<p>"So we could fight," Harry said, "we could just keep on with the
same fight. You could tell me that it was right for my mother to
die, because she was the wife of James, who killed a Death Eater.
But bad for <em>your</em> mother to die, because <em>she</em> was
innocent. And I could tell you that it was right for your mother to
die, that Dumbledore must have had some <em>reason</em> that made
it <em>okay</em> to burn her alive in her own bedroom; but bad for
<em>my</em> mother to die. But you know, Draco, either way,
wouldn't it be <em>obvious</em> that we were just being biased?
Because the rule that says that it's wrong to kill innocent people,
that rule can't switch on for my mother and off for yours, and it
can't switch on for your mother and off for mine. If you tell me
that Lily was an enemy of the Death Eaters and it's right to kill
your enemies, then the same rule says that Dumbledore was right to
kill Narcissa, since she was <em>his</em> enemy." Harry's voice
went hoarse. "So if the two of us are going to agree on anything,
it's going to be that <em>neither</em> of their deaths were right
and that <em>no one's</em> mother should die any more."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The fury boiling inside Draco was so great that he could barely
stop himself from storming out of the room; all that halted him was
the recognition of a critical moment; and a small remnant of
friendship, a tiny flash of sympathy, for he had forgotten, he'd
<em>forgotten,</em> that Harry's mother <em>and</em> father were
dead by the Dark Lord's hand.</p>
<p>The silence stretched.</p>
<p>"You can talk," Harry said, "Draco, talk to me, I won't get
angry - are you thinking, I don't know, that Narcissa dying was
much worse than Lily dying? That it's wrong for me even to make the
comparison?"</p>
<p>"I guess I was stupid too," Draco said. "All this time, all this
time I forgot that you must hate the Death Eaters for killing your
parents, hate Death Eaters the way I hate Dumbledore." And Harry
had never said anything, never reacted when Draco talked about
Death Eaters, kept it <em>hidden</em> - Draco was a fool.</p>
<p>"No," Harry said. "It's not - it's not like that, Draco, I, I
don't even know how to explain to you, except to say that a thought
like that, wouldn't," Harry's voice choked, "you wouldn't ever be
able to use it, to cast the Patronus Charm..."</p>
<p>Draco felt a sudden wrench in his heart, unwanted but he felt
it. "Are you pretending you're just going to <em>forget</em> about
your own parents? Are you saying I should just <em>forget</em>
about Mother?"</p>
<p>"So you and I <em>have</em> to be enemies then?" Now Harry's
voice was growing equally wild. "What have <em>we</em> ever done to
<em>each other</em> that means we have to be enemies? I refuse to
be trapped like that! Justice can't mean that <em>both</em> of us
should attack <em>each other,</em> it doesn't make sense!" Harry
stopped, took a deep breath, ran his fingers back through the
deliberate mess of his hair - the fingers came away sweaty, Draco
could see it. "Draco, listen, we can't expect to meet on everything
right away, you and I. So I won't ask you to say that the Dark Lord
was <em>wrong</em> to kill my mother, just say that it was...
<em>sad</em>. We won't talk about whether or not it was
<em>necessary</em>, whether it was <em>justified</em>. I'll just
ask you to say that it was sad that it happened, that my mother's
life was valuable too, you'll just say that for now. And I'll say
it was sad that Narcissa died, because her life was also worth
something. We can't expect to agree on everything right away, but
if we start out by saying that every life is precious, that it's
sad when <em>anyone</em> dies, then I know we'll meet someday.
That's what I want you to say. Not who was right. Not who was
wrong. Just that it was sad when your mother died, and sad when my
mother died, and it would be sad if Hermione Granger died, every
life is precious, can we agree on that and let the rest go by for
now, is it enough if we just agree on that? Can we, Draco? That
seems... more like a thought someone could use to cast the Patronus
Charm."</p>
<p>There were tears in Harry's eyes.</p>
<p>And Draco was getting angry again. "Dumbledore <em>killed</em>
Mother, it's not enough to just say it's <em>sad!</em> I don't
understand what you think <em>you</em> have to do, but the Malfoys
<em>have</em> to take revenge!" Not avenging the deaths of family
went <em>beyond</em> weakness, beyond dishonor, you might as well
not <em>exist.</em></p>
<p>"I'm not arguing with that," Harry said quietly. "But will you
say that Lily Potter's death was sad? Just say that one thing?"</p>
<p>"That's..." Draco was having difficulty finding words again. "I
know, I know how you feel, but don't you see Harry, even if I just
say that Lily Potter's death was <em>sad,</em> that's
<em>already</em> going against the Death Eaters!"</p>
<p>"Draco, you've <em>got</em> to be able to say the Death Eaters
were wrong about some things! You <em>have</em> to, you can't
progress as a scientist otherwise, there'll be a roadblock in your
way, an authority you can't contradict. Not every change is an
improvement, but every improvement is a change, you can't do
anything <em>better</em> unless you can manage to do it
<em>differently</em>, <em>you've got to let yourself do better than
other people!</em> Even your father, Draco, even him. You've got to
be able to point to something your father did and say it was
mistaken, because he wasn't <em>perfect</em>, and if you can't say
that, you can't do better."</p>
<p>Father had warned him, every night before he went to sleep for a
month before he went to Hogwarts, that there would be people with
this goal.</p>
<p>"You're trying to break me loose of Father."</p>
<p>"Trying to break a <em>part</em> of you loose," said Harry.
"Trying to let you fix some things your father got mistaken. Trying
to let you <em>do better</em>. But not... trying to break your
<em>Patronus!</em> " Harry's voice got softer. "I wouldn't want to
break something bright like that. Who knows, fixing Slytherin House
might need <em>that</em>, too..."</p>
<p>It was getting to Draco, that was the thing, despite everything
it was getting to him, you had to be really careful around Harry
because his arguments sounded so convincing <em>even when he was
wrong.</em> "And what you're <em>not</em> admitting is that
Dumbledore told you that you could avenge your parents' deaths by
taking Lord Malfoy's son from him -"</p>
<p>"<em>No.</em> No. That part's just wrong." Harry took a deep
breath. "I did not know who Dumbledore was, or who the Dark Lord
was, or who the Death Eaters were, or how my parents died, until
three days before I came to Hogwarts. The day you and I first met
in the clothes shop, that was the day I learned. And Dumbledore
doesn't even <em>like</em> Muggle science, or he says he doesn't, I
got a chance to probe him on it once. The thought of taking revenge
on the Death Eaters through you has <em>never</em> crossed my mind,
not even <em>once</em> until now. I didn't know who the Malfoys
were when I met you in the clothes shop, and then I <em>liked</em>
you."</p>
<p>There was a long silence.</p>
<p>"I wish I could trust you," Draco said. His voice was shaking.
"If I could just <em>know</em> you were telling the truth,
everything would be so much simpler -"</p>
<p>And then suddenly it came to Draco.</p>
<p>The way to know whether Harry Potter really meant everything he
said, about wanting to fix Slytherin House, about being sad that
Mother had died.</p>
<p>It would be illegal, and since he'd have to do it without
Father's help, it would be <em>dangerous</em>, he couldn't even
trust Harry Potter to <em>help,</em> but...</p>
<p>"All right," Draco said. "I've thought of a definitive
experiment."</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"I want to give you a drop of Veritaserum," Draco said. "Just
one drop, so you can't lie, but not enough to <em>make</em> you
answer anything. I don't know where I'll get it, but I'll make
<em>certain</em> it's safe -"</p>
<p>"Um," Harry said. There was a helpless look on his face. "Draco,
um -"</p>
<p>"Don't say it," Draco said. His voice was firm and calm. "If you
say no, that's my experimental result right there."</p>
<p>"Draco, I'm an Occlumens -"</p>
<p>"<em>OH THAT IS SUCH A LIE -</em>"</p>
<p>"I was trained by Mr. Bester. Professor Quirrell set it up.
Look, Draco, I'll <em>take</em> one drop of Veritaserum if you can
get it, I'm just <em>warning</em> you that I'm an Occlumens. Not a
perfect Occlumens, but Mr. Bester said I was putting up a complete
block, and I could probably beat Veritaserum."</p>
<p>"<em>You're in your first year at Hogwarts! That's just
crazy!</em> "</p>
<p>"Know a Legilimens you can trust? I'll be happy to demonstrate -
look, Draco, I'm sorry, but doesn't the fact that I <em>told</em>
you count for something? I <em>could</em> have just let you do it,
you know."</p>
<p>"<em>WHY? Why are you always like this, Harry? Why do you have
to mess everything up even when it's IMPOSSIBLE? And stop smiling,
this isn't funny!</em> "</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I <em>know</em> it's not funny, I -"</p>
<p>It took a while for Draco to get himself under control.</p>
<p>But Harry was right. Harry <em>could</em> have just let Draco
administer the Veritaserum. <em>If</em> he really was an
Occlumens... Draco didn't know who he could ask to try Legilimency,
but he could at least ask Professor Quirrell if it was true...
Could Draco trust <em>Professor Quirrell?</em> Maybe Professor
Quirrell would just say anything Harry asked him to.</p>
<p>Then Draco remembered the other thing Harry had told him to ask
Professor Quirrell, and thought of a different test.</p>
<p>"You <em>know</em>," said Draco. "You <em>know</em> what it
costs me, if I agree that the poison in Slytherin's House is hating
Muggleborns, and say that Lily Potter's death was sad. And that's
<em>part of your plan,</em> don't tell me it's not."</p>
<p>Harry said nothing, which was wise of him.</p>
<p>"There's something I want from you in return," said Draco. "And
before then, an experimental test I want to try -"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Draco pushed open the door to which the portraits had directed
them, and this time it was the right door. Before them was a small
empty place of stone set against the night sky. Not a roof like the
one he'd dropped Harry from, but a tiny and proper courtyard, far
above the ground. With proper railings, elaborate traceries of
stone that flushed seamlessly into the stone floor... How so much
<em>artistry</em> had been infused into the creation of Hogwarts
was something that still awed Draco every time he thought about it.
There must have been some way to do it all at once, no one could
have detailed so much piece by piece, the castle <em>changed</em>
and every new piece was like that. It was so far beyond the
wizardry of these fading days that no one would have believed it if
they hadn't seen the proof in Hogwarts itself.</p>
<p>Cloudless and cold, the winter night sky; it got dark long
before students' curfew, in the final days of January.</p>
<p>The stars shining brightly, in the clear air.</p>
<p>Harry had said that being under the stars would help him.</p>
<p>Draco touched his chest with his wand, slid his fingers in a
practiced motion, and said, "<em>Thermos.</em>" A warmth spread
through him, starting from his heart; the wind went on blowing on
his face, but he was no longer cold.</p>
<p>"<em>Thermos,</em>" Harry's voice said behind him.</p>
<p>They went together to the railing, to look down at the ground a
long way below. Draco tried to figure if they were in one of the
towers that could be seen from outside, and found that right now he
couldn't quite seem to picture how Hogwarts looked from outside.
But the ground below was always the same; he could see the
Forbidden Forest as a vague outline, and moonlight glittering from
the Hogwarts Lake.</p>
<p>"You know," Harry's voice said quietly from beside him where his
arms leaned on the railing next to Draco's, "one of the things that
Muggles get really wrong, is that they don't turn all their lights
out at night. Not even for one hour every month, not even for
fifteen minutes once a year. The photons scatter in the atmosphere
and wash out all but the brightest stars, and the night sky doesn't
look the same at all, not unless you go far away from any cities.
Once you've looked up at the sky over Hogwarts, it's hard to
imagine living in a Muggle city, where you wouldn't be able to see
the stars. You certainly wouldn't want to spend your whole life in
Muggle cities, once you'd seen the night sky over Hogwarts."</p>
<p>Draco glanced at Harry, and found that Harry was craning his
neck to stare up at where the Milky Way arched across the
darkness.</p>
<p>"Of course," Harry went on, his voice still quiet, "you can't
ever see the stars properly from <em>Earth,</em> either, the air
always gets in the way. You have to look from somewhere else, if
you want to see the real thing, the stars burning hard and bright,
like their true selves. Have you ever wished that you could just
whisk yourself up into the night sky, Draco, and go look at what
there is to see around other Suns than ours? If there were no limit
to the power of your magic, is that one of the things you would do,
if you could do anything?"</p>
<p>There was a silence, and then Draco realized that he was
expected to answer. "I didn't think of it before," Draco said.
Without any conscious decision, his voice came out as soft and
hushed as Harry's. "Do you really think anyone would ever be able
to do that?"</p>
<p>"I don't think it'll be that easy," said Harry. "But I know I
don't mean to spend my whole life on Earth."</p>
<p>It would have been something to laugh at, if Draco hadn't known
that some Muggles had already left, without even using magic.</p>
<p>"To pass your test," Harry said, "I'm going to have to say what
it means to <em>me,</em> that thought, the whole thing, not the
shorter version I tried to explain to you before. But you should be
able to see it's the same idea, only more general. So <em>my</em>
version of the thought, Draco, is that when we go out into the
stars, we might find other people there. And if so, they certainly
won't look like we do. There might be things out there that are
grown from crystal, or big pulsating blobs... or they might be made
of magic, now that I think about it. So with all that strangeness,
how do you recognize a <em>person?</em> Not by the shape, not by
how many arms or legs it has. Not by the sort of substance it's
made out of, whether that's flesh or crystal or stuff I can't
imagine. You would have to recognize them as people from their
<em>minds</em>. And even their minds wouldn't work just like ours
do. But anything that lives and thinks and knows itself and doesn't
want to die, it's sad, Draco, it's sad if that person has to die,
because it doesn't want to. Compared to what might be out there,
every human being who ever lived, we're all like brothers and
sisters, you could hardly even tell us apart. The ones out there
who met <em>us,</em> they wouldn't see British or French, they
wouldn't be able to tell the difference, they'd just see a human
being. Humans who can love, and hate, and laugh, and cry; and to
<em>them</em>, the ones out there, that would make us all as alike
as peas in the same pod. <em>They</em> would be different, though.
<em>Really</em> different. But that wouldn't stop us, and it
wouldn't stop them, if we both wanted to be friends together."</p>
<p>Harry raised his wand then, and Draco turned, and looked away,
as he had promised; looked toward the stone floor and stone wall in
which the door was set. For Draco had promised not to look, and not
to tell anyone of what Harry had said, or anything at all of what
happened here this night, though he didn't know why it was to be so
secret.</p>
<p>"I have a dream," said Harry's voice, "that one day sentient
beings will be judged by the patterns of their minds, and not their
color or their shape or the stuff they're made of, or who their
parents were. Because if we can get along with crystal things
someday, how silly would it be not to get along with Muggleborns,
who are shaped like us, and think like us, as alike to us as peas
in a pod? The crystal things wouldn't even be able to tell the
difference. How impossible is it to imagine that the hatred
poisoning Slytherin House would be worth taking with us to the
stars? Every life is precious, everything that thinks and knows
itself and doesn't want to die. Lily Potter's life was precious,
and Narcissa Malfoy's life was precious, even though it's too late
for them now, it was sad when they died. But there are other lives
that are still alive to be fought for. Your life, and my life, and
Hermione Granger's life, all the lives of Earth, and all the lives
beyond, to be defended and protected, <em>EXPECTO
PATRONUM!</em> "</p>
<p>And there was light.</p>
<p>Everything turned to silver in that light, the stone floor, the
stone wall, the door, the railings, so dazzling just in the
reflection that you could hardly even see them, even the air seemed
to shine, and the light grew brighter, and brighter, and brighter
-</p>
<p>When the light ended it was like a shock, Draco's hand went
automatically to his robe to bring out a handkerchief, and it was
only then that he realized he was crying.</p>
<p>"There is your experimental result," Harry's voice said quietly.
"I really did mean it, that thought."</p>
<p>Draco slowly turned toward Harry, who had lowered his wand
now.</p>
<p>"That, that's got to be a trick, right?" Draco said. He couldn't
take many more of these shocks. "Your Patronus - can't
<em>really</em> be that bright -" And yet it <em>had</em> been
Patronus light, once you knew what you were looking at, you
couldn't mistake it for anything else.</p>
<p>"That was the <em>true</em> form of the Patronus Charm," Harry
said. "Something that lets you put all your strength into the
Patronus, without hindrance from within yourself. And before you
ask, I did not learn it from Dumbledore. He does not know the
secret, and could not cast the true form if he did. I solved the
puzzle for myself. And I knew, once I understood, that this spell
must not be spoken of. For your sake, I undertook your test; but
you must not speak of it, Draco."</p>
<p>Draco didn't know any more, he didn't know where the true
strength lay, or the right of things. Double vision, double vision.
Draco wanted to call Harry's ideals weakness, Hufflepuff
foolishness, the sort of lie that rulers told to placate the
populace and that Harry had been silly enough to believe for
himself, foolishness taken seriously and raised up to insane
heights, projected out onto the stars themselves -</p>
<p>Something beautiful and hidden, mysterious and bright -</p>
<p>"Will I," whispered Draco, "be able to cast a Patronus like
that, someday?"</p>
<p>"If you always keep seeking the truth," Harry said, "and if you
don't refuse the warm thoughts when you find them, then I'm sure
you will. I think a person could get anywhere if they just kept
going long enough, even to the stars."</p>
<p>Draco wiped his eyes with his handkerchief again.</p>
<p>"We should go back inside," Draco said in an unsteady voice,
"someone could've seen it, all that light -"</p>
<p>Harry nodded, and moved to and through the door; and Draco
looked up at the night sky one last time before he followed.</p>
<p>Who <em>was</em> the Boy-Who-Lived, that he was already an
Occlumens, and could cast the true form of the Patronus Charm, and
do other strange things? What was Harry's Patronus, why must it
stay unseen?</p>
<p>Draco didn't ask any of those questions, because Harry might
have <em>answered</em>, and Draco just couldn't take any more
shocks today. He just <em>couldn't</em>. One more shock and his
head was going to just fall right off his shoulders and go bounce,
bounce, bounce down the corridors of Hogwarts.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>They'd ducked into a small alcove, instead of going all the way
back to the classroom, at Draco's request; he was feeling too
nervous to put it off any longer.</p>
<p>Draco put up a Quieting barrier, and then looked at Harry in
silent question.</p>
<p>"I've been thinking about it," Harry said. "I'll do it, but
there are five conditions -"</p>
<p>"<em>Five?</em> "</p>
<p>"Yes, five. Look, Draco, a pledge like this is just
<em>begging</em> to go terribly wrong somehow, you <em>know</em> it
would go wrong if this were a play -"</p>
<p>"Well, it's not!" Draco said. "Dumbledore killed Mother. He's
evil. It's one of those things you talk about that <em>doesn't</em>
have to be complicated."</p>
<p>"Draco," Harry said, his voice careful, "all I <em>know</em> is
that <em>you</em> say that <em>Lucius</em> says that
<em>Dumbledore</em> says he killed Narcissa. To believe that
unquestioningly, I have to trust you <em>and</em> Lucius
<em>and</em> Dumbledore. So like I said, there are conditions. The
first one is that at any point <em>you</em> can release me from the
pledge, if it no longer seems like a good idea. It has to be a
deliberate and intended decision on your part, of course, not a
trick of wording or something."</p>
<p>"Okay," said Draco. That sounded safe enough.</p>
<p>"Condition two is that I'm pledging to take as an enemy whoever
actually did kill Narcissa, as determined to the honest best of my
ability as a rationalist. Whether that's Dumbledore, or someone
else. And you have my word that I'll exercise my best ability as a
rationalist to keep that judgment honest, as a question of simple
fact. Agreed?"</p>
<p>"I don't like it," said Draco. He didn't, the whole point was to
make sure Harry never went with Dumbledore. Still, if Harry
<em>was</em> honest, he'd catch on to Dumbledore soon enough; and
if dishonest, he'd already broken his word... "But I'll agree."</p>
<p>"Condition three is that Narcissa has to have been <em>burned
alive</em>. If that part of the story turns out to be something
exaggerated just to make it sound a little worse, then I get to
decide for myself whether or not to still go through with the
pledge. Good people sometimes have to kill. But they don't ever
torture people to death. It's because Narcissa was <em>burned
alive</em> that I know whoever did that was evil."</p>
<p>Draco kept his temper, barely.</p>
<p>"Condition four is that if Narcissa got her own hands dirty,
and, say, <em>Crucioed</em> someone's child into insanity, and that
person burned Narcissa for revenge, the deal might be off again.
Because then it was still wrong for them to burn her, they still
should've just killed her without pain; but it wasn't <em>evil</em>
the same way as if she was just Lucius's love who never did
anything herself, like you said. Condition five is that if whoever
killed Narcissa was tricked somehow into doing it, then my enemy is
whoever tricked them, not the person who was tricked."</p>
<p>"All this <em>really</em> sounds like you're planning to weasel
out of it -"</p>
<p>"Draco, I won't take a good person as an enemy, not for you or
anyone. I have to really believe they're in the wrong. But I've
thought about it, and it seems to me that if Narcissa didn't do any
evil with her own hands, just fell in love with Lucius and chose to
stay his wife, then whoever burned her alive in her own bedroom
isn't likely to be a good guy. And I'll pledge to take as my enemy
whoever made that happen, whether it's Dumbledore or anyone else,
unless you deliberately release me from that pledge. Hopefully
<em>that</em> won't go wrong the way it would if this were a
play."</p>
<p>"I'm not happy," said Draco. "But okay. You pledge to take my
mother's murderer as your enemy, and I'll -"</p>
<p>Harry waited, with a patient look on his face, while Draco tried
to make his voice work again.</p>
<p>"I'll help you fix the problem with Slytherin House hating
Muggleborns," Draco finished in a whisper. "And I'll say it was sad
that Lily Potter died."</p>
<p>"So be it," said Harry.</p>
<p>And it was done.</p>
<p>The break, Draco knew, had just widened a little more. No, not a
little, a <em>lot.</em> There was a sensation of drifting away, of
being lost, further and further from shore, further and further
from home...</p>
<p>"Excuse me," Draco said. He turned away from Harry, and then
tried to calm himself, he had to do this test, and he didn't want
to fail it from being nervous or ashamed.</p>
<p>Draco raised his wand into the starting position for the
Patronus Charm.</p>
<p>Remembered falling from his broomstick, the pain, the fear,
imagined it coming from a tall figure in a cloak, looking like a
dead thing left in water.</p>
<p>And then Draco closed his eyes, the better to remember Father
holding his small, cold hands in his own warm strength.</p>
<p><em>Don't be frightened, my son, I'm here...</em></p>
<p>The wand swung up in a broad brandish, to drive the fear away,
and Draco was surprised at the strength of it; and he remembered in
that moment that <em>Father</em> wasn't lost, would never be lost,
would always be there and strong in his own person, no matter what
happened to Draco, and his voice cried, <em>"Expecto
Patronum!"</em></p>
<p>Draco opened his eyes.</p>
<p>A shining snake looked back at him, no less bright than
before.</p>
<p>Behind him, he heard <em>Harry</em> exhale a breath, as though
in relief.</p>
<p>Draco gazed into the white light. It seemed he wasn't lost
completely, after all.</p>
<p>"That reminds me," said Harry after a while. "Can we test my
hypothesis about how to use a Patronus to send messages?"</p>
<p>"Is it going to surprise me?" said Draco. "I don't want any more
surprises today."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry had claimed that the idea wasn't all that strange and he
didn't see how it could possibly shock Draco in any way, which made
Draco feel even more nervous, somehow; but Draco could see how
important it was to have a way of sending messages in
emergencies.</p>
<p>The trick - or so Harry hypothesized - was wanting to spread the
good news, wanting the recipient to know the truth of whatever
happy thought you'd used to cast the Patronus Charm. Only instead
of telling the recipient in words, the Patronus itself was the
message. By wanting them to see that, the Patronus would go to
them.</p>
<p>"Tell Harry," said Draco to the luminous snake, even though
Harry was standing only a few paces away on the other side of the
room, "to, um, beware the green monkey," this being a sign from a
play Draco had once seen.</p>
<p>And then, just like at King's Cross station, Draco wanted Harry
to know that Father had always cared for him; only this time he
didn't try to say it in words, but wanted to say it with the happy
thought itself.</p>
<p>The bright snake slithered across the room, looking more like it
was slithering through the air rather than the stone itself; it got
to Harry after traveling that short distance -</p>
<p>- and said to Harry, in a strange voice that Draco recognized as
how he himself probably sounded to other people, "Beware the green
monkey."</p>
<p>"<em>Hsssss ssss sshsshssss,</em>" said Harry.</p>
<p>The snake slithered back across the floor to Draco.</p>
<p>"Harry says the message is received and acknowledged," said the
shining Blue Krait in Draco's voice.</p>
<p>"Huh," Harry said. "Talking to Patronuses feels odd."</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>"Why are you looking at me like that?" said the Heir of
Slytherin.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Aftermath:</em></p>
<p>Harry stared at Draco.</p>
<p>"You mean just <em>magical</em> snakes, right?"</p>
<p>"N-no," said Draco. He was looking rather pale, and was still
stammering, but had at least stopped the incoherent noises he'd
been making earlier. "You're a Parselmouth, you can speak
Parseltongue, it's the language of all snakes everywhere. You can
understand any snake when it talks, and they can understand when
you talk to them... Harry, you can't <em>possibly</em> believe you
were Sorted into Ravenclaw! <em>You're the Heir of
Slytherin!</em> "</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>"SNAKES ARE SENTIENT?"</p>

Pt 2<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>The adrenaline was already flowing in Harry's veins, his heart
already hammering in his chest, there in that darkened and bankrupt
store. Professor Quirrell had finished explaining, and in one hand,
Harry held a tiny wooden twig that would be the key. This was it,
this was the day and the moment when Harry started acting the part.
His first true adventure, a dungeon to be pierced, an evil
government to be defied, a maiden in distress to be rescued. Harry
should have been more frightened, more reluctant, but instead he
felt only that it was time and past time to start becoming the
people he had read about in his books; to begin his journey toward
what he had always known he was meant to be, a hero. To take the
first step on the road that led to Kimball Kinnison and Captain
Picard and Liono of Thundera and definitely <em>not</em> Raistlin
Majere. So far as Harry's brain knew from watching early morning
cartoons, when you grew up you were supposed to gain amazing powers
and save the universe, that was what Harry's brain had seen adults
doing and adopted as its role model for the maturation process, and
Harry very much wanted to start growing up.</p>
<p>And if the pattern of the story called for the hero to lose some
part of his innocence, as the result of his first adventure; then
for now, at least, in this still-innocent moment, it seemed time
and past time for him to experience that pain. Like casting off
clothes too small for him; or like finally advancing to the next
stage of the game, after being stuck for eleven years on world 3,
level 2 of Super Mario Brothers.</p>
<p>Harry had read enough novels to suspect that he wouldn't feel
this enthusiastic afterward, so he was enjoying it while it
lasted.</p>
<p>There was a popping sound as something near Harry disappeared,
and then there was no more time for heroic brooding.</p>
<p>Harry's hand snapped the small wooden twig.</p>
<p>A hook yanked motionlessly at Harry's abdomen as the portkey
activated, feeling like a much harder pull this time than the
smaller transports between the Hogwarts grounds and Diagon Alley
-</p>
<p>- and dropped him into the middle of a huge roll of thunder
dying away, and a lash of cold rain whipping him across the face,
the water coating Harry's glasses and blinding him in an instant,
turning the world into a blur even as he began to fall toward the
raging ocean waves far below.</p>
<p>He had arrived high, high, high above the empty North Sea.</p>
<p>The shock of the blasting storm almost made Harry let go of the
broomstick that Professor Quirrell had given him, which would not
have been a good idea. It took nearly a full second for Harry to
get his wits together and bring his broomstick back up in an easy
swoop.</p>
<p>"I'm here," said an unfamiliar voice from a patch of empty air
above him; low and gravelly, the voice of the sallow lanky bearded
man Professor Quirrell had Polyjuiced into before Disillusioning
himself and his broomstick.</p>
<p>"I'm here," Harry said from beneath the Cloak of Invisibility.
He hadn't used Polyjuice himself. Wearing a different body hindered
your magic, and Harry might need all of his little magic about him;
thus the plan called for Harry to stay invisible at nearly all
times, instead of Polyjuicing.</p>
<p>(Neither of them had spoken the other's name. You simply didn't
use your names at any point during an illegal mission, even
invisibly hovering over an anonymous patch of water in the North
Sea. You simply didn't. It would be stupid.)</p>
<p>Carefully keeping a grip on the broomstick with one hand, while
the rain and wind howled around him, Harry raised his wand in an
equally careful grip and Imperviused his glasses.</p>
<p>Then, with the lenses clear, Harry looked around.</p>
<p>He was surrounded by wind and rain, it might have been five
degrees Celsius if he was lucky; he'd already had a Warming Charm
cast on himself just from being outside in February, but it wasn't
standing up to the driving cold droplets. Worse than snow, the rain
soaked into every exposed surface. The Cloak of Invisibility turned
all of you invisible, but it didn't <em>cover</em> all of you, and
that meant it didn't protect all of you from rain. Harry's face was
exposed to the full force of the driven water, and it was driving
straight into his neck and soaking down into his shirt, also the
sleeves of his robes and the cuffs of his pants and his shoes, the
water took every bit of cloth as an avenue to sneak in.</p>
<p>"This way," said the Polyjuiced voice, and a spark of green
light lit up in front of Harry's broomstick, and then darted away
in a direction that seemed to Harry like every other direction.</p>
<p>Through the blinding rain, Harry followed. He lost it sometimes,
that small green spark, and each time he did, Harry called out, and
the spark would reappear in front of him a few seconds later.</p>
<p>When Harry had caught the trick of following the spark, it
accelerated, and Harry kicked the broomstick into high gear and
followed. The rain whipped him harder, feeling like Harry imagined
it must feel to get a faceful of shotgun pellets, but his glasses
stayed clear and protected his eyes.</p>
<p>It was only a few minutes later, at the broomstick's full speed,
that Harry caught a glimpse of a huge shadow through the rain,
towering far across the waters.</p>
<p>And felt a distant, hollow echo of emptiness radiating from
where Death waited, washing over Harry's mind and parting around
it, like a wave breaking on stone. Harry knew his enemy this time,
and his will was steel and all of the light.</p>
<p>"I can already feel the Dementors," said the gravelly voice of
the Polyjuiced Quirrell. "I did not expect that, not this
soon."</p>
<p>"Think of the stars," Harry said, over a distant rumble of
thunder. "Don't allow any anger in you, nothing negative, just
think of the stars, what it feels like to forget yourself and fall
bodilessly through space. Hold to that thought like an Occlumency
barrier across your entire mind. The Dementors will have some
trouble reaching past that."</p>
<p>There was silence for a moment, then, "Interesting."</p>
<p>The green spark lifted, and Harry inclined his broomstick
slightly upward to follow, even as it steered them into a fogbank,
a cloud hovering low on the waters.</p>
<p>Soon they were hovering above and slightly oblique of the huge
three-sided metal building, as it loomed far below. The triangle of
steel was hollow, not solid, it was a building of three thick solid
walls and no center. The Aurors on guard roomed in the top level
and southern side of the building, Professor Quirrell had said,
protected by their Patronus Charms. The legal entrance into Azkaban
was on the roof of the southwest corner of the building. Which the
two of them wouldn't use, of course. Instead they would use a
corridor that ran directly beneath the northern corner of the
building. Professor Quirrell would go down first, and puncture a
hole in the roof and its wards right at the northern tip, leaving
behind an illusion to cover the gap.</p>
<p>The prisoners were kept in the side of the building, in levels
corresponding to their crimes. And at the bottom, in the uttermost
center and depth of Azkaban, lay a nest of more than a hundred
Dementors. Loads of dirt were occasionally dropped in to keep up
the level, as the matter directly exposed to the Dementors broke
down into mud and nothingness...</p>
<p>"Wait one minute," said the rough voice, "follow me at speed,
and pass through with care."</p>
<p>"Got it," Harry said lowly.</p>
<p>The spark winked out, and Harry began to count, <em>one one
thousand, two one thousand, three one thousand...</em></p>
<p><em>...sixty one thousand,</em> and Harry dived, the wind
shrieking around him as he dived, down toward the vast metal
structure, down toward where he could feel the shadows of Death
waiting for him, draining light and radiating emptiness, as the
metal structure grew larger and larger. Plain and featureless
loomed the vast grey shape, but for a single raised boxlike
structure in the southwest corner. The north corner was simply
blank, Professor Quirrell's hole undetectable.</p>
<p>Harry pulled up sharply as he approached the north corner,
giving himself more safety margin than he would have bothered with
in flying classes, but not too much. As soon as he'd come to a
halt, he began to slowly lower his broomstick again, toward what
looked like the solid roof of the tip of the north corner.</p>
<p>Descending through the illusory roof while invisible was a
strange experience, and then Harry found himself in a metal
corridor lighted with a dim orange light - which, Harry realized
after a startled glance, was coming from an old-fashioned mantled
gas lamp...</p>
<p>...for magic would fail, be drained away after a time, in the
presence of Dementors.</p>
<p>Harry dismounted his broom.</p>
<p>The pull of the emptiness was stronger now, as it parted and
flowed around Harry without touching him. They were distant but
they were many, the wounds in the world; Harry could have pointed
to them with his eyes closed.</p>
<p>"<em>Casst your Patronuss,</em>" hissed a snake from the floor,
looking more discolored than green in the dim orange light.</p>
<p>The note of stress came through even in Parseltongue. Harry was
surprised; Professor Quirrell had said that Animagi in their
Animagus forms were much less vulnerable to Dementors. (For the
same reason the Patronuses were animals, Harry assumed.) If
Professor Quirrell was in this much trouble in his snake form, what
had been happening to him while he was in the human form that let
him use his magic...?</p>
<p>Harry's wand was already rising in his hand.</p>
<p>This would be the beginning.</p>
<p>Even if it was only one person, just one person that he could
save from the darkness, even if he wasn't powerful enough yet to
teleport <em>all</em> of Azkaban's prisoners to safety and burn the
triangular hell down to bedrock...</p>
<p>Even so it was a start, it was a beginning, it was a down
payment on everything that Harry meant to accomplish with his life.
No more waiting, no more hoping, no more mere promising, it would
all begin here. Here and <em>now.</em></p>
<p>Harry's wand slashed down to point at where the Dementors waited
far below.</p>
<p>"<em>Expecto Patronum!</em> "</p>
<p>The glowing humanoid figure blazed up into existence. It wasn't
the sun-bright thing that it had been before... probably because
Harry hadn't quite been able to stop himself from thinking about
all the <em>other</em> prisoners in their cells, the ones that he
<em>wasn't</em> here to save.</p>
<p>It might be for the best, though. Harry would need to keep this
Patronus going for a while, and it might be better if it wasn't
quite so bright.</p>
<p>The Patronus dimmed a little further, at that thought; and then
further again, as Harry tried to put a little less of his strength
into it, until finally the brilliant humanoid figure was glowing
only slightly brighter than the brightest animal Patronus, and
Harry felt that he could dim it no further without risking losing
it entirely.</p>
<p>And then, "<em>It iss sstable,</em>" Harry hissed, and began
feeding his broomstick into his pouch. His wand stayed in his hand,
and a slight, sustainable flow from him replaced the slight losses
from his Patronus.</p>
<p>The snake blurred into the form of a lanky, sallow man, holding
Professor Quirrell's wand in one hand and a broomstick in the
other. The lanky man staggered as he came back into existence, and
went to lean against the wall for a moment.</p>
<p>"Well done, if perhaps a trifle slow," murmured the gravelly
voice. Professor Quirrell's dryness was in it, even though it
didn't fit the voice, nor did the grave look on the thickly bearded
face. "I cannot feel them at all, now."</p>
<p>A moment later, the broomstick went into the man's robes and
vanished. Then the man's wand rose and tapped on his head, and with
a sound like a cracking eggshell he disappeared once more.</p>
<p>Within the air blossomed a faint green spark, and Harry, still
enshrouded in the Cloak of Invisibility, followed after.</p>
<p>If you had been watching from outside, you would have seen
nothing but a small green spark drifting through the air, and a
brilliantly silver humanoid walking after it.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>They went down, and down, and down, passing gas lamp after gas
lamp, and the occasional huge metal door, descending into Azkaban
within what seemed like utter silence. Professor Quirrell had set
up some type of barrier by which <em>he</em> could hear what went
on nearby, but no sounds could pass outward, and no sounds could
reach Harry.</p>
<p>Harry hadn't quite been able to stop his mind from wondering
<em>why</em> the silence, or stop his mind from giving the answer.
The answer he'd already known on some wordless level of
anticipation that had prompted him to futilely try not to think
about it.</p>
<p>Somewhere behind those huge metal doors, people were
screaming.</p>
<p>The silver humanoid figure wavered, brightening and dimming,
every time Harry thought about it.</p>
<p>Harry had been told to cast a Bubble-Head Charm on himself. To
prevent himself from smelling anything.</p>
<p>All the enthusiasm and heroism had worn off already, as Harry
had known it would, it hadn't taken long even by his standards, the
process had completed itself the very first time they passed one of
those metal doors. Every metal door was locked with a huge lock, a
lock of simple unmagical metal that wouldn't have stopped a
first-year Hogwarts student - if you still had a wand, if you still
had your magic, which the prisoners didn't. Those metal doors were
not the doors of individual cells, Professor Quirrell had said,
each one opened into a corridor in which there would be a group of
cells. Somehow that helped a little, not thinking that each door
corresponded directly to a prisoner who was waiting right behind
it. Instead there might be <em>more</em> than one prisoner, which
diminished the emotional impact; just like the study showing that
people contributed more when they were told that a given amount of
money was required to save one child's life, than when told the
same total amount was needed to save eight children...</p>
<p>Harry was finding it increasingly hard not to think about it,
and every time he did, the light of his Patronus fluctuated.</p>
<p>They came to the place where the passageway turned left, at the
corner of the triangular building. Once again there were descending
metal steps, another flight of stairs; once again they went
down.</p>
<p>Mere murderers were not put into the lowest of cells. There was
always a lower place you could go, an even worse punishment to
fear. No matter how low you had already sunk, the government of
magical Britain had some threat remaining against you if you did
even worse.</p>
<p>But Bellatrix Black had been the Death Eater who inspired more
fear than anyone save Lord Voldemort himself, a beautiful and
deadly sorceress absolutely loyal to her master; she had been, if
such a thing were possible, more sadistic and evil even than
You-Know-Who, as though she were trying to outdo her master...</p>
<p>...that was what the world knew of her, what the world believed
of her.</p>
<p>But before then, Professor Quirrell had told Harry, before the
debut of the Dark Lord's most terrible servant, there had been a
girl in Slytherin who had been quiet, keeping mostly to herself,
harming no one. Afterward there had been made-up stories told about
her, memories changing in retrospect (Harry knew well the research
on that). But at the time, while she still attended school, the
most talented witch in Hogwarts had been known as a gentle girl
(Professor Quirrell had said). Her few friends had been surprised
when she'd joined the Death Eaters, and more surprised that she'd
been hiding so much darkness behind that sad, wistful smile.</p>
<p>That was who Bellatrix had once been, the most promising witch
of her own generation, before the Dark Lord stole her and broke
her, shattered her and reshaped her, binding her to him on a deeper
level and with darker arts than any Imperius.</p>
<p>Ten years Bellatrix had served the Dark Lord, killing who he
bade her kill, torturing who he bade her torture.</p>
<p>And then the Dark Lord had finally been defeated.</p>
<p>And Bellatrix's nightmare had continued.</p>
<p>Somewhere inside Bellatrix there might be something that was
still screaming, that had been screaming the whole time, something
a psychiatric Healer could bring back; or there might not be,
Professor Quirrell had no way of knowing. But either way, they
could...</p>
<p>...they could at least get her out of Azkaban...</p>
<p>Bellatrix Black had been put into the lowest level of
Azkaban.</p>
<p>Harry was having trouble not imagining what he would see when
they got to her cell. Bellatrix must have had almost no fear of
death, in the beginning, if she was still alive at all.</p>
<p>They descended another flight of stairs, coming that much closer
to Death and Bellatrix, the clacking of their invisible shoes the
only sound that Harry could hear. Dim orange light coming from the
gas lights, the faint green spark drifting through the air, the
shining figure following with its silver light fluctuating from
time to time.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>After descending many times, they came in time to a corridor
that did not end in stairs, and a final metal door, and the green
spark halted before it.</p>
<p>Harry's heart had calmed a little, as they descended far into
the depths of Azkaban without anything happening. But now it was
hammering his chest once more. They were at the bottom, and the
shadows of Death were very close at hand.</p>
<p>A soft metal click came from the lock, as Professor Quirrell
opened the way.</p>
<p>Harry took a deep breath and remembered everything that
Professor Quirrell had told him. The hard part wouldn't just be
getting the pretended personality right enough to fool Bellatrix
Black herself, the hard part would be keeping his Patronus going at
the same time...</p>
<p>The green spark winked out, and a moment later a meter-high
snake shimmered into existence, no longer invisible.</p>
<p>The metal door moved with a slow creaking sound as Harry pushed
on it with his invisible hand, opened it just a crack, and peered
through.</p>
<p>He saw a straight corridor that terminated in solid stone. There
was no light there but what crept in from Harry's Patronus. That
was bright enough for him to see the outer bars of the eight cells
set into the corridor, but he couldn't see the insides; more
importantly, though, he didn't see anyone in the corridor
itself.</p>
<p>"<em>I ssee nothing,</em>" hissed Harry.</p>
<p>The snake darted on ahead, swiftly twisting across the
floor.</p>
<p>A moment later -</p>
<p>"<em>Sshe iss alone,</em>" hissed the snake.</p>
<p><em>Stay,</em> Harry thought to his Patronus, which took up a
position just to one side of the door, as though guarding it; and
then Harry pushed the door open further, and followed within.</p>
<p>The first cell Harry looked at contained a dessicated corpse,
skin gone grey and mottled, flesh worn through in places to expose
the bone beneath, no eyes -</p>
<p>Harry shut his eyes. He could still do that, he was still
invisible, he wasn't betraying anything by shutting his eyes.</p>
<p>He'd known it already, he'd read it on page six of his
Transfiguration book, that you stayed in Azkaban until your prison
term was done. If you died before it was up they kept you there
until they released your corpse. If your term was for life, they
just left the body in the cell until the cell was needed, at which
point they threw your body into the Dementors' pit. But it was
still a shock to see, that corpse had been a <em>person</em> who'd
just been <em>left</em> there -</p>
<p>The light in the room wavered.</p>
<p><em>Steady,</em> thought Harry in his core. It wouldn't be good
for Professor Quirrell if that Patronus went out from his thinking
sad thoughts. This near to the Dementors the Defense Professor
might just fall dead where he stood. <em>Steady, Harry James
Potter-Evans-Verres, steady!</em></p>
<p>With that thought, Harry opened his eyes again, there wasn't
time to waste.</p>
<p>The second cell he looked at contained only a skeleton.</p>
<p>And behind the bars of the third cell he saw Bellatrix
Black.</p>
<p>Something precious and irreplaceable inside Harry withered like
dry grass.</p>
<p>You could tell the woman wasn't a skeleton, that her head wasn't
a skull, because the texture of skin was still different from the
texture of bone, no matter how white and pale she'd become, waiting
in the dark alone. Either they weren't feeding her much, or what
she ate, the shadows of Death drained from her; for her eyes seemed
shrunken below their lids, her lips looked too shriveled to close
over her teeth. The color seemed leached out of the black clothing
she had worn into prison, like the Dementors had drained that too.
They'd been meant to be daring, those clothes, and now they lay
loosely over a skeleton, exposing shriveled skin.</p>
<p><em>I'm here to save her, I'm here to save her, I'm here to save
her,</em> Harry thought to himself, desperately, over and over with
an effort like Occlumency, willing his Patronus not to go out, to
stay and <em>protect Bellatrix from the Dementors</em> -</p>
<p>In his heart, in his core, Harry held to all his pity and his
compassion, his will to save her from the darkness; the silver
radiance coming in through the open door brightened, even as he
thought it.</p>
<p>And in another part of him, like he was just letting another
part of his mind carry out a habit without paying much attention to
it...</p>
<p>A cold expression came over Harry's face, invisibly beneath the
hood.</p>
<p>"Hello, my dear Bella," said a chill whisper. "Did you miss
me?"</p>
</div>
<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 53: The Stanford Prison Experiment,
Pt 3<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>The corpse of a woman opened her eyes, and the dull sunken orbs
gazed out at nothing.</p>
<p>"Mad," Bellatrix muttered in a cracked voice, "It seems that
little Bella is going mad..."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell had instructed Harry, calmly and precisely,
how he was to act in Bellatrix's presence; how to form the pretense
he would maintain in his mind.</p>
<p><em>You found it expedient, or perhaps just amusing, to make
Bellatrix fall in love with you, to bind her to your
service.</em></p>
<p>That love would have persisted through Azkaban, Professor
Quirrell had said, because to Bellatrix it would not be a happy
thought.</p>
<p><em>She loves you utterly, completely, with her whole being. You
do not return her love, but consider her useful. She knows
this.</em></p>
<p><em>She was the deadliest weapon you possessed, and you called
her your dear Bella.</em></p>
<p>Harry remembered it from the night the Dark Lord killed his
parents: the cold amusement, the contemptuous laughter, that
high-pitched voice of deathly hate. It didn't seem at all difficult
to guess what the Dark Lord would say.</p>
<p>"I hope you are <em>not</em> mad, Bella dear," said the chill
whisper. "Mad is not useful."</p>
<p>Bellatrix's eyes flickered, tried to focus on empty air.</p>
<p>"My... Lord... I waited for you but you did not come... I looked
for you but I could not find you... you are alive..." All her words
came out in a low mutter, if there was emotion in it, Harry could
not tell.</p>
<p>"<em>Sshow her your face,</em>" hissed the snake at Harry's
feet.</p>
<p>Harry cast back the hood of the Cloak of Invisibility.</p>
<p>The part of him that Harry had placed in control of his facial
expressions looked at Bella without the slightest trace of pity,
only cool, calm interest. (While in his core, Harry thought, <em>I
will save you, I will save you no matter what...</em>)</p>
<p>"The scar..." muttered Bellatrix. "That child..."</p>
<p>"So they all still think," said Harry's voice, and gave a thin
little chuckle. "You looked for me in the wrong place, Bella
dear."</p>
<p>(Harry had asked why Professor Quirrell couldn't be the one to
play the part of the Dark Lord, and Professor Quirrell had pointed
out that there was no plausible reason for <em>him</em> to be
possessed by the shade of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.)</p>
<p>Bellatrix's eyes remained fixed on Harry, she said no word.</p>
<p><em>"Ssay ssomething in Parsseltongue,"</em> hissed the
snake.</p>
<p>Harry's face turned to the snake, to make it clear that he was
addressing it, and hissed, "<em>One two three four five ssix sseven
eight nine ten.</em>"</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>"Those who do not fear the darkness..." murmured Bellatrix.</p>
<p>The snake hissed, "<em>Will be conssumed by it.</em>"</p>
<p>"Will be consumed by it," whispered the chill voice. Harry
didn't particularly want to think about how Professor Quirrell had
gotten that password. His brain, which thought about it anyway,
suggested that it had probably involved a Death Eater, a quiet
isolated place, and some lead-pipe Legilimency.</p>
<p>"Your wand," murmured Bellatrix, "I took it from the Potters'
house and hid it, my lord... under the tombstone to the right of
your father's grave... will you kill me, now, if that was all you
wished of me... I think I must have always wanted you to be the one
to kill me... but I can't remember now, it must have been a happy
thought..."</p>
<p>Harry's heart wrenched inside him, it was unbearable, and - and
he couldn't cry, couldn't let his Patronus fade -</p>
<p>Harry's face showed a flicker of annoyance, and his voice was
sharp as it said, "Enough foolishness. You're to come with me,
Bella dear, unless you prefer the company of the Dementors."</p>
<p>Bellatrix's face twitched in brief puzzlement, the shrunken
limbs did not stir.</p>
<p>"<em>You'll need to float her out,</em>" Harry hissed to the
snake. "<em>Sshe can no longer think of
esscaping.</em>"<em><br></em></p>
<p>"<em>Yess,</em>" hissed the snake, "<em>but do not
underesstimate her, sshe wass the deadliesst of warriorss.</em>"
The green head dipped in warning. "<em>One would be wisse to fear
me, boy, even were I sstarved and nine-tenthss dead; be wary of
her, allow no ssingle flaw in your pretensse.</em>"</p>
<p>The green snake smoothly glided out of the door.</p>
<p>And shortly after, a man with sallow skin and a fearful
expression on his bearded face cringed into the room with his wand
in hand.</p>
<p>"My Lord?" the servant said falteringly.</p>
<p>"Do as you were instructed," the Dark Lord whispered in that
chill voice, sounding even more terrible coming from a child's
body. "And do not let your Patronus falter. Remember, if I do not
return there will be no reward for you, and it will be long before
your family is allowed to die."</p>
<p>Having spoken those dreadful words, the Dark Lord pulled his
invisibility cloak over his head, and disappeared.</p>
<p>The cringing servant opened the door to Bellatrix's cage, and
pulled a tiny needle from his robes with which he poked the human
skeleton. The single drop of red blood produced was soon absorbed
into a small doll, which was laid upon the floor, and the servant
began to chant in a whisper.</p>
<p>Soon another living skeleton lay upon the floor, motionless.
Afterward the servant seemed to hesitate for a moment, until from
the empty air hissed an impatient command. Then the servant pointed
his wand at Bellatrix and spoke a word, and the living skeleton
lying on the bed was naked, and the skeleton lying on the floor was
clothed in her faded dress.</p>
<p>The servant tore a small strip of cloth from the dress, as it
lay upon the seeming corpse; and from his own robes, the fearful
man then produced an empty glass flask with small traces of golden
fluid clinging to its inside. This flask was concealed in a corner,
the strip of skirt laid over it, the leached cloth nearly blending
with the gray metal wall.</p>
<p>Another wave of the servant's wand floated the human skeleton
lying on the bed into the air, and in almost the same motion
clothed her in new black robes. An ordinary-looking bottle of
chocolate milk was put into her hand, and a chill whisper ordered
Bellatrix to grasp the bottle and begin drinking it, which she did,
her face still looking only puzzled.</p>
<p>Then the servant turned Bellatrix invisible, and turned himself
invisible, and they left. The door closed behind them all and
clicked as it locked, plunging the corridor into darkness once
more, unchanged but for a small flask concealed in the corner of
one cell, and a fresh corpse lying upon its floor.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Earlier, in the deserted shop, Professor Quirrell had told Harry
that they were going to commit the perfect crime.</p>
<p>Harry had unthinkingly started to repeat back the standard
proverb that there was no such thing as a perfect crime, before he
actually thought about it for two-thirds of a second, remembered a
wiser proverb, and shut his mouth in midsentence.</p>
<p><em>What do you think you know, and how do you think you know
it?</em></p>
<p>If you <em>did</em> commit the perfect crime, nobody would ever
find out - so how could anyone possibly <em>know</em> that there
weren't perfect crimes?</p>
<p>And as soon as you looked at it that way, you realized that
perfect crimes probably got committed <em>all the time</em>, and
the coroner marked it down as death by natural causes, or the
newspaper reported that the shop had never been very profitable and
had finally gone out of business...</p>
<p>When Bellatrix Black's corpse was found dead in her cell the
next morning, there within the prison of Azkaban from which
(everyone knew) no one had ever escaped, nobody bothered doing an
autopsy. Nobody thought twice about it. They just locked up the
corridor and left, and the <em>Daily Prophet</em> reported it in
the obituary column the next day...</p>
<p>...that was the perfect crime which Professor Quirrell had
planned.</p>
<p>And it wasn't Professor Quirrell who screwed it up.</p>
</div>
<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 54: The Stanford Prison Experiment,
Pt 4<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>A faint green spark moved forward to set the pace, and behind it
followed a brilliant silver figure, all other entities invisible.
They had traversed five legs of corridor, turned right five times
and gone up five flights of stairs; and when Bellatrix had finished
her second bottle of chocolate milk, she had been given solid bars
of chocolate to eat.</p>
<p>It was after her third bar of chocolate that strange noises
began to come from Bellatrix's throat.</p>
<p>It took a moment for Harry to understand, to process the sounds,
it didn't sound like anything he'd ever heard before; the rhythm of
it was shattered, almost unrecognizable, it took him that long to
realize that Bellatrix was crying.</p>
<p>Bellatrix Black was crying, the Dark Lord's most terrible weapon
was crying, she was invisible but you could hear it, tiny pathetic
sounds she was trying to suppress, even now.</p>
<p>"It's real?" said Bellatrix. Tonality had returned into her
voice, no longer a dead mutter, it rose up at the end to form the
question. "It's real?"</p>
<p><em>Yes,</em> thought the part of Harry simulating the Dark
Lord, <em>now be silent</em> -</p>
<p>He couldn't make those words pass his lips, he just
couldn't.</p>
<p>"I knew - you would - come to me - someday," Bellatrix's voice
quavered and fractured as she drew breath for quiet sobs, "I knew -
you were alive - that you would come - to me - my Lord..." there
was a long inhalation like a huge gasp, "and that even - when you
came - you still wouldn't love me - never - you would never love me
back - that was why - they couldn't take - my love from me - even
though I can't remember - can't remember so many other things -
though I don't know what I forgot - but I remember how much I love
you, Lord -"</p>
<p>There was a knife stabbing through Harry's heart, he'd never
heard anything so terrible, he wanted to hunt down the Dark Lord
and kill him just for this...</p>
<p>"Do you still - have use for me - my Lord?"</p>
<p>"No," hissed Harry's voice, without him even thinking, it just
seemed to be operating on automatic, "I entered Azkaban on a whim.
Of course I have use for you! Don't ask foolish questions."</p>
<p>"But - I'm weak," said Bellatrix's voice, and a full sob escaped
her, it sounded much too loud in the corridors of Azkaban, "I can't
kill for you, my Lord, I'm sorry, they ate it all, ate me all up,
I'm too weak to fight, what good am I to you now -"</p>
<p>Harry's brain cast about desperately for some way to reassure
her, from the lips of a Dark Lord who would never speak a single
word of caring.</p>
<p>"Ugly," said Bellatrix. Her voice said that word like it was the
final nail in her coffin, the last despair. "I'm ugly, they ate
that too, I'm, I'm not pretty any more, you won't even, be able, to
use me, as a reward, for your servants - even the Lestranges, won't
want, to hurt me, any more -"</p>
<p>The brilliant silver figure stopped walking.</p>
<p>Because Harry had stopped walking.</p>
<p><em>The Dark Lord, he...</em> The part of Harry's self that was
soft and vulnerable was screaming in disbelieving horror, trying to
reject reality, refuse the understanding, even as a colder and
harder part completed the pattern: <em>She obeyed him in that as
she obeyed him in all things.</em></p>
<p>The green spark bobbed urgently, darted forward.</p>
<p>The silver humanoid stayed in place.</p>
<p>Bellatrix was sobbing harder.</p>
<p>"I'm, I'm not, I can't be, useful, any more..."</p>
<p>Giant hands were squeezing Harry's chest, wringing him like a
washcloth, trying to crush his heart.</p>
<p>"Please," whispered Bellatrix, "just kill me..." Her voice
seemed to calm, once she said that. "Please Lord, kill me, I've no
reason to live if I'm no use to you... I only want it to stop...
please hurt me one last time, my Lord, hurt me until I stop... I
love you..."</p>
<p>It was the saddest thing Harry had ever heard.</p>
<p>The bright silver shape of Harry's Patronus flickered -</p>
<p>Wavered -</p>
<p>Brightened -</p>
<p>The fury that was rising in Harry, his rage against the Dark
Lord who had done this, the rage against the Dementors, against
Azkaban, against the world that allowed such horror, it all seemed
to be pouring straight through his arm and into his wand without
there being any way of blocking it, he tried willing it to stop and
nothing happened.</p>
<p>"My Lord!" whispered the disguised voice of Professor Quirrell.
"My spell is going out of control! Help me, my Lord!"</p>
<p>Brighter the Patronus, brighter and brighter, it was waxing
faster than on the day that Harry had destroyed a Dementor.</p>
<p>"My Lord!" the silhouette said in a terrified whisper. "Help me!
Everyone will feel it, my Lord!"</p>
<p><em>Everyone will feel it,</em> thought Harry. His imagination
could picture it clearly, the prisoners in their cells stirring as
the cold and darkness fell away, replaced by healing light.</p>
<p>Every exposed surface now burned like a white sun in the
reflections, the silhouette of Bellatrix's skeleton and the sallow
man now clearly visible in the blaze, the Disillusionment spells
unable to keep pace with the unearthly brilliance; only the Cloak
of Invisibility out of the Deathly Hallows withstood it.</p>
<p>"My Lord! <em>You must stop it!</em> "</p>
<p>But Harry could no longer will it to stop, he no longer wanted
it to stop. He could sense it, more and more of the sparks of life
in Azkaban being sheltered by his Patronus, <em>as it unfolded like
spreading wings of sunlight, the air turned to absolute silver as
he thought it, Harry knew what he had to do.</em></p>
<p>"<em>Please, my Lord!</em> "</p>
<p>The words went unheard.</p>
<p><em>They were far from him, the Dementors in their pit, but
Harry knew that they could be destroyed even at this distance if
the light blazed bright enough, he knew that Death itself could not
face him if he stopped holding back, so he unsealed all the gates
inside him and sank the wells of his spell into all the deepest
parts of his spirit, all his mind and all his will, and gave over
absolutely everything to the spell -</em></p>
<p>And in the interior of the Sun, an only slightly dimmer shadow
moved forward, reaching out an entreating hand.</p>
<p><em>WRONG<br>
DON'T</em></p>
<p>The sudden sense of doom clashed with Harry's steel
determination, dread and uncertainty striving against the bright
purpose, nothing else might have reached him but that. The
silhouette took another step forward and another, the sense of doom
rising to a point of terrible catastrophe; and in the drench of
cold water, Harry saw it, he realized the consequences of what he
was doing, the danger and the trap.</p>
<p>If you had been watching from outside you would have seen the
interior of the Sun brightening and dimming...</p>
<p>Brightening and dimming...</p>
<p>...and finally fading, fading, fading into ordinary moonlight
that seemed like pitch darkness by contrast.</p>
<p>Within the darkness of that moonlight stood a sallow man with
his hand outstretched in entreaty, and the skeleton of a woman,
lying upon the floor, a puzzled look upon her face.</p>
<p>And Harry, still invisible, fallen to his knees. The greater
danger had passed, and now Harry was just trying not to collapse,
to keep the spell going at the lower level. He'd drained something,
hopefully not lost something <em>-</em> he should have known,
should have remembered, that it wasn't mere magic that fueled the
Patronus Charm -</p>
<p>"Thank you, my Lord," whispered the sallow man.</p>
<p>"Fool," said the hard voice of a boy pretending to be a Dark
Lord. "Did I not warn you that the spell could prove fatal if you
failed to control your emotions?"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's eyes did not widen, of course.</p>
<p>"Yes, my Lord, I understand," said the Dark Lord's servant in a
faltering voice, and turned to Bellatrix -</p>
<p>She was already pushing herself off the floor, slowly, like an
old, old Muggle woman. "How funny," Bellatrix whispered, "you were
almost killed by a Patronus Charm..." A giggle that sounded like it
was blowing dust out of her giggle pipes. "I could punish you,
maybe, if my Lord froze you in place and I had knives... maybe I
can be useful after all? Oh, I feel a little better now, how
strange..."</p>
<p>"Be silent, dear Bella," Harry said in a chill voice, "until I
give you leave to speak."</p>
<p>There was no reply, which was obedience.</p>
<p>The servant levitated the human skeleton, and made her invisible
once more, followed shortly by his own disappearance with the sound
of another cracking egg.</p>
<p>They passed on through the corridors of Azkaban.</p>
<p>And Harry knew that as they passed, the prisoners were stirring
in their cells as the fear lifted for one precious moment, maybe
even feeling a small touch of healing as his light passed them by,
and then collapsing down again as the cold and darkness pressed
back in.</p>
<p>Harry was trying very hard not to think about it.</p>
<p>Otherwise his Patronus would wax until it burned away every
Dementor in Azkaban, blazing bright enough to destroy them even at
this distance...</p>
<p>Otherwise his Patronus would wax until it burned away every
Dementor in Azkaban, taking all of Harry's life as fuel.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>In the Auror's quarters at the top of Azkaban, one Auror trio
was snoring in the barracks, one Auror trio was resting in the
breakroom, and one Auror trio was on duty in the command room,
keeping their watch. The command room was simple but large, with
three chairs at back where three Aurors sat, their wands always in
hand to sustain their three Patronuses, as the bright white forms
paced in front of the open window, sheltering them all from the
Dementors' fear.</p>
<p>The three of them usually stuck to the back, and played poker,
and didn't look out the window. You could have seen some sky there,
sure, and there was even an hour or two every day where you
could've seen some sun, but that window also looked down on the
central pit of hell.</p>
<p>Just in case a Dementor wanted to float up and talk to you.</p>
<p>There was no way that Auror Li would have agreed to serve duty
here, triple pay or no triple pay, if he hadn't had a family to
support. (His real name was Xiaoguang, and everyone called him Mike
instead; he'd named his children Su and Kao, which hopefully would
serve them better.) His only consolation, besides the money, was
that at least his mates played an excellent game of Dragon Poker.
Though it would be hard <em>not</em> to, at this point.</p>
<p>It was their 5,366th game and Li had what would probably be his
best hand of the 5300s. It was a Saturday in February and there
were three players, which let him shift the suit of any one hole
card except a two, three, or seven; and that was enough to let him
build a Corps-a-Corps with Unicorns, Dragons, and sevens...</p>
<p>Across the table from him, Gerard McCusker looked up from the
table cards toward the direction of the window, staring.</p>
<p>The sinking feeling came over Li's stomach with surprising
speed.</p>
<p>If his seven of hearts got hit by a Dementor Modifier and turned
into a six, he was going straight down to two pair and McCusker
might beat that -</p>
<p>"Mike," said McCusker, "what's with your Patronus?"</p>
<p>Li turned his head and looked.</p>
<p>His soft silver badger had turned away from its watch over the
pit and was staring downward at something only it could see.</p>
<p>A moment later, Bahry's moonlit duck and McCusker's bright
anteater followed suit, staring in the same downward direction.</p>
<p>They all exchanged glances, and then sighed.</p>
<p>"I'll tell them," said Bahry. Protocol called for sending the
three Aurors who were off-duty but not sleeping to investigate
anything anomalous. "Maybe relieve one of them and take the C
spiral, if you two don't mind."</p>
<p>Li exchanged a glance with McCusker, and they both nodded. It
wasn't too hard to break into Azkaban, if you were wealthy enough
to hire a powerful wizard, and well-intentioned enough to recruit
someone who could cast the Patronus Charm. People with friends in
Azkaban would do that, break in just to give someone a half-day's
worth of Patronus time, a chance at some real dreams instead of
nightmares. Leave them a supply of chocolate to conceal in their
cell, to increase the chance they lived through their sentence. And
the Aurors on guard... well, even if you got caught, you could
probably convince the Aurors to overlook it, in exchange for the
right bribe.</p>
<p>For Li, the right bribe tended to be in the range of two Knuts
and a silver Sickle. He hated this place.</p>
<p>But Bahry One-Hand had a wife and the wife had healer's bills,
and if you could afford to hire someone who could break into
Azkaban, then you could afford to grease Bahry's remaining palm
pretty hard, if he was the one who caught you.</p>
<p>By unspoken agreement, none of them giving anything away by
being the first to propose it, the three of them finished out their
poker hand first. Li won, since no Dementors had actually shown up.
And by then the Patronuses had stopped staring and gone back to
their normal patrol, so it was probably nothing, but procedure was
procedure.</p>
<p>After Li raked in the pot, Bahry gave them all formal nods, and
stood up from the table. The older man's long white locks brushed
against his fancy red robes, his robes brushed the metal floor of
the command room, as Bahry went through the separating door that
led to the formerly off-duty Aurors.</p>
<p>Li had been Sorted into Hufflepuff, and he sometimes felt a
little queasy about this kind of business. But Bahry had shown them
all the pictures, and you had to let a man do what he could for his
poor sick wife, especially when he only had seven months left
before his retirement.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The faint green spark floated through the metal corridors, and
the silver humanoid, seeming a little dimmer now, followed after
it. Sometimes the bright figure would flare, especially when they
passed one of the huge metal doors, but it always died back down
again.</p>
<p>Mere eyes could not have seen the invisible others: the
eleven-year-old Boy-Who-Lived, and the living skeleton that was
Bellatrix Black, and the Polyjuiced Defense Professor of Hogwarts,
all traveling together through Azkaban. If that was the beginning
of a joke, Harry didn't know the punchline.</p>
<p>They'd gone up another four flights of stairs before the rough
voice of the Defense Professor said, simply and without emphasis,
"Auror coming."</p>
<p>It took too long, a whole second maybe, for Harry to understand,
for the jolt of adrenaline to pump into his blood, and for him to
remember what Professor Quirrell had already discussed with him and
told him to do in this case, and then Harry spun on his heel and
flew back the way they'd come.</p>
<p>Harry reached the flight of stairs, and frantically laid himself
down on the third step from the top, the cold metal feeling hard
even through his cloak and robes. Trying to move his head up, to
peer over the lip of the stairs, showed that he couldn't see
Professor Quirrell; and that meant that Harry was out of the line
of any stray fire.</p>
<p>His shining Patronus followed after him, and lay down beside him
on the step just beneath him; for it too must not be seen.</p>
<p>There was a faint sound as of wind or whooshing, and then the
sound of Bellatrix's invisible body coming to rest on a stair
further below, she had no place in this except -</p>
<p>"Stay still," said the cold high whisper, "stay silent."</p>
<p>There was stillness, and silence.</p>
<p>Harry pressed his wand against the side of the metal step just
above him. If he was anyone else he would have needed to take a
Knut out of his pocket... or rip off a bit of cloth from his
robe... or bite off one of his nails... or find a speck of rock
large enough that he could see it and solid enough to stay in one
place and orientation while it touched his wand. But with Harry's
almighty power of partial Transfiguration, this was not necessary;
he could skip that particular step of the operation and use any
material near to hand.</p>
<p>Thirty seconds later Harry was the proud new owner of a curved
mirror, and...</p>
<p>"<em>Wingardium Leviosa,</em>" Harry whispered as quietly as he
could.</p>
<p>...was levitating it just above the steps, and watching, in that
curved surface, almost the whole corridor where Professor Quirrell
invisibly waited.</p>
<p>Harry heard it in the distance, then, the sound of
footsteps.</p>
<p>And saw the form (a little hard to see in the mirror) of a
person in red robes, coming down the stairs, entering the seemingly
empty corridor; accompanied by a small Patronus animal that Harry
couldn't quite make out.</p>
<p>The Auror was protected by a blue shimmer, it was hard to see
the details but Harry could see that much, the Auror had shields
already raised and strengthened.</p>
<p><em>Crap,</em> thought Harry. According to the Defense
Professor, the essential art of dueling consisted of trying to put
up defenses that would block whatever someone was likely to throw
at you, while trying in turn to attack in ways that were likely to
go past their current set of defenses. And by far the easiest way
to win any sort of real fight - Professor Quirrell had said this
over and over - was to shoot the enemy before they raised a shield
in the first place, either from behind or from close enough range
that they couldn't dodge or counter in time.</p>
<p>Though Professor Quirrell might still be able to get in a shot
from behind, if -</p>
<p>But the Auror halted after taking three steps into the
corridor.</p>
<p>"Nice Disillusionment," said a hard male voice that Harry didn't
recognize. "Now show yourself, or you'll be in <em>real</em>
trouble."</p>
<p>The form of the sallow, bearded man became visible then.</p>
<p>"And you with the Patronus," said the hard voice. "Come out too.
<em>Now.</em>"</p>
<p>"Wouldn't be smart," said the gravelly voice of the sallow man.
It was no longer the terrified voice of the Dark Lord's servant; it
had suddenly become the professional intimidation of a competent
criminal. "You don't want to see who's behind me. Trust me, you
don't. Five hundred Galleons, cold cash up front, if you turn
around and walk away. Big trouble for your career if you
don't."</p>
<p>There was a long pause.</p>
<p>"Look, whoever you are," said the hard voice. "You seem confused
about how this works. I don't care if that's Lucius Malfoy behind
you or Albus bloody Dumbledore. You <em>all</em> come out, I scan
the whole lot of you, and <em>then</em> we talk about how much this
is going to cost you -"</p>
<p>"Two thousand Galleons, final offer," said the gravelly voice,
taking on a warning undertone. "That's ten times the going rate and
more than you make in a year. And believe me, if you see something
you shouldn't, you're going to regret not taking that -"</p>
<p>"Shut it!" said the hard voice. "You've got exactly five seconds
to drop that wand before I drop you. Five, four -"</p>
<p><em>What are you doing, Professor Quirrell?</em> Harry thought
frantically. <em>Attack first! Cast a shield at least!</em></p>
<p>"- three, two, one! <em>Stupefy!</em> "</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Bahry stared, a chill running down his spine.</p>
<p>The man's wand had moved so fast that it was like it had
Apparated into place, and Bahry's stunner was currently sparkling
tamely at the end of it, not blocked, not countered, not deflected,
<em>caught</em> like a fly in honey.</p>
<p>"My offer has gone back down to five hundred Galleons," said the
man in a colder, more formal voice. He smiled dryly, and the smile
looked wrong on that bearded face. "And you shall need to accept a
Memory Charm."</p>
<p>Bahry had already swapped the harmonics on his shields so that
his own stunner couldn't pass back through, already tilted his wand
back into a defensive position, already raised his hardened
artificial hand into position to block anything blockable, and was
already thinking wordless spells to put more layers on his shields
-</p>
<p>The man wasn't looking at Bahry. Instead he was poking curiously
at Bahry's stunner where it still wavered on the end of his wand,
drawing out red sparks and flicking them away with his fingers,
slowly disassembling the hex like a child's rod puzzle.</p>
<p>The man hadn't raised any shields of his own.</p>
<p>"Tell me," the man said in a disinterested voice that didn't
seem to quite fit the rough throat - Polyjuice, Bahry would have
called it, if he'd thought that anyone could possibly do magic that
delicate from inside someone else's body - "what did you do in the
last war? Put yourself in harm's way, or stay out of trouble?"</p>
<p>"Harm's way," said Bahry. His voice kept the iron calm of an
Auror with nearly a hundred full years on the force, seven months
short of mandatory retirement, Mad-Eye Moody couldn't have said it
with any more hardness.</p>
<p>"Fight any Death Eaters?"</p>
<p>Now a grim smile graced Bahry's own face. "Two at once." Two of
You-Know-Who's own warrior-assassins, personally trained by their
dark master. Two Death Eaters at once against Bahry alone. It had
been the toughest fight of Bahry's life, but he'd stood his ground,
and walked away with only the loss of his left hand.</p>
<p>"Did you kill them?" The man sounded idly curious, and he
continued to draw threads of fire out of the much-diminished
stunbolt still captive on the end of his wand, his fingers now
weaving small patterns of Bahry's own magic before flicking to
disperse them.</p>
<p>Sweat broke out on Bahry's skin beneath his robes. His metal
hand flashed downward, ripped the mirror from his belt - "Bahry to
Mike, I need backup!"</p>
<p>There was a pause, and silence.</p>
<p>"Bahry to Mike!"</p>
<p>The mirror lay dull and lifeless in his hand. Slowly, Bahry put
it back on his belt.</p>
<p>"It's been quite a while since I had a serious fight with a
serious opponent," the man said, still not looking up at Bahry.
"Try not to disappoint me too much. You can attack whenever you're
ready. Or you can walk away with five hundred Galleons."</p>
<p>There was a long silence.</p>
<p>Then the air screamed like metal cutting glass as Bahry slashed
his wand downward.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry could hardly see it, could hardly make out anything amid
the lights and flashes, his mirror's curve was perfect (they'd
practiced that tactic before in the Chaos Legion) but the scene was
still too small, and Harry had the feeling he wouldn't be able to
understand even if he was watching from a meter away, it was all
happening too <em>fast,</em> red blasts deflecting from blue
shields, green bars of light clashing together, shadowy forms
appearing and vanishing, he couldn't even tell who was casting
what, except that the Auror was shouting incantation after
incantation and frantically dodging while Professor Quirrell's
Polyjuiced form stood in one place and flicked his wand, mostly
silently, but now and then pronouncing words in unrecognizable
languages that would white out the whole mirror and show half the
Auror's shielding torn away as he staggered back.</p>
<p>Harry had seen exhibition duels between the strongest
seventh-year students, and this was so far above it that Harry's
mind felt numbed, looking at how far he had left to go. There
wasn't a single seventh-year student who could have lasted half a
minute against the Auror, all three seventh-year armies put
together might not be able to scratch the Defense Professor...</p>
<p>The Auror had fallen to the ground, one knee and one hand
supporting himself as the other hand gestured frantically and his
mouth shouted desperate words, the few incantations that Harry
recognized were all shield spells, as a flock of shadows spun
around the Auror like a whirlwind of razors.</p>
<p>And Harry saw Professor Quirrell's Polyjuiced form deliberately
point his wand at where the Auror kneeled and fought the last
moments of his battle.</p>
<p>"Surrender," said the gravelly voice.</p>
<p>The Auror spat something unspeakable.</p>
<p>"In that case," said the voice, "<em>Avada</em> -"</p>
<p>Time seemed to move very slowly, like there was time to hear the
individual syllables, <em>Ke,</em> and <em>Da,</em> and
<em>Vra,</em> time to watch the Auror starting to throw himself
desperately aside; and even though it was all happening so slowly,
somehow there wasn't time to <em>do</em> anything, no time for
Harry to open his lips and scream <em>NO</em>, no time to move,
maybe even not any time to think.</p>
<p>Only time for one desperate wish that an innocent man should not
die <em>-</em></p>
<p>And a blazing silver figure stood before the Auror.</p>
<p>Stood there just a fraction of a second before the green light
struck home.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Bahry was twisting frantically aside, not knowing if he was
going to make it -</p>
<p>His eyes were focused on his opponent and his onrushing death,
so Bahry only briefly saw the outline of the brilliant silhouette,
the Patronus brighter than any he'd ever seen, saw it just barely
long enough to recognize the impossible shape, before the green and
the silver light collided and both lights vanished, <em>both</em>
lights vanished, <em>the Killing Curse had been blocked</em>, and
then Bahry's ears were pierced as he saw his terrible opponent
screaming, screaming, screaming, clutching at his head and
screaming, starting to fall as Bahry was already falling -</p>
<p>Bahry hit the ground, falling from his own frantic lunge, and
his dislocated left shoulder and broken rib screamed in protest.
Bahry ignored the pain, managed to scramble back to his knees,
brought up his wand to stun his opponent, he didn't understand what
was happening but he knew that this was his only chance.</p>
<p>"<em>Stupefy!</em> "</p>
<p>The red bolt struck out toward the man's falling body, and was
torn apart in midair and dissipated - and not by any shield. Bahry
could <em>see</em> it, the wavering in the air that surrounded his
fallen and screaming opponent.</p>
<p>Bahry could feel it like a deadly pressure on his skin, the flux
of magic building and building and building toward some terrible
breaking point. His instincts screamed at him to run before the
explosion came, this was no Charm, no Curse, this was wizardry run
wild, but before Bahry could even finish getting to his feet -</p>
<p>The man threw his wand away from himself (he threw away his
wand!) and a second later, his form blurred and vanished
entirely.</p>
<p>A green snake lay motionless on the ground, unmoving even before
Bahry's next stunner spell, fired in sheer reflex, hit it without
resistance.</p>
<p>As the dreadful flux and pressure began to dissipate, as the
wild wizardry died back down, Bahry's dazed mind noticed that the
scream was continuing. Only it sounded different, like the scream
of a young boy, coming from the stairs leading down to the next
lower level.</p>
<p>That scream choked off too, and then there was silence except
for Bahry's frantic panting.</p>
<p>His thoughts were slow, confused, disarrayed. His opponent had
been <em>insanely</em> powerful, that hadn't been a duel, it had
been like his first year as a trainee Auror trying to fight Madam
Tarma. The Death-Eaters hadn't been a tenth that good, Mad-Eye
Moody wasn't that good... and who, what, how in the name of
Merlin's balls had anyone blocked a <em>Killing Curse?</em></p>
<p>Bahry managed to summon the energy to press his wand against his
rib, mutter the healing spell, and then press it again to his
shoulder. It took more out of him than it should have, took far too
much out of him, his magic was within a bare breath of utter
exhaustion; he didn't have anything left for his minor cuts and
bruises or even to reinforce the scraps left of his shielding. It
was all he could do not to let his Patronus go out.</p>
<p>Bahry breathed deeply, heavily, steadied his breath as much as
he could before he spoke.</p>
<p>"You," Bahry said. "Whoever you are. Come out."</p>
<p>There was silence, and it occurred to Bahry that whoever it was
might be unconscious. He didn't understand what had just happened,
but he'd heard the scream...</p>
<p>Well, there was one way to test that.</p>
<p>"Come out," said Bahry, making his voice harder, "or I start
using area-effect curses." He probably couldn't have managed one if
he'd tried.</p>
<p>"Wait," said a boy's voice, a <em>young</em> boy's voice, high
and thin and wavering, like someone was holding back exhaustion or
tears. The voice now seemed to be coming from closer to hand.
"Please wait. I'm - coming out -"</p>
<p>"Drop the invisibility," growled Bahry. He was too tired to
bother with anti-Disillusionment Charms.</p>
<p>A moment later, a young boy's face emerged from within an
unfolding invisibility cloak, and Bahry saw the black hair, the
green eyes, the glasses, and the angry red lightning-bolt scar.</p>
<p>If he'd had twenty fewer years of experience under his belt he
might have blinked. Instead he just spat something that he probably
shouldn't ought to say in front of the Boy-Who-Lived.</p>
<p>"He, he," the boy's wavering voice said, his young face looked
frightened and exhausted and tears were still trickling down his
cheeks, "he kidnapped me, to make me cast my Patronus... he said
he'd kill me if I didn't... only I couldn't let him just kill
you..."</p>
<p>Bahry's mind was still dazed, but things were slowly starting to
click into place.</p>
<p>Harry Potter, the only wizard ever to survive a Killing Curse.
Bahry might have been able to dodge the green death, he'd certainly
been trying, but if the matter came up before the Wizengamot,
they'd rule it was a life debt to a Noble House.</p>
<p>"I see," Bahry said in a much gentler growl. He started to walk
toward the boy. "Son, I'm sorry for what you've been through, but I
need you to drop the cloak and drop your wand."</p>
<p>The rest of Harry Potter emerged from invisibility, showing the
sweat-soaked blue-trimmed Hogwarts robes, and his right hand
clutching an eleven-inch holly wand so hard his knuckles were
white.</p>
<p>"Your wand," Bahry repeated.</p>
<p>"Sorry," whispered the eleven-year-old boy, "here," and he held
out the wand toward Bahry.</p>
<p>Bahry barely stopped himself from snarling at the traumatized
boy who'd just saved his life. Instead he overrode the impulse with
a sigh, and just stretched out a hand to take the wand. "Look, son,
you're <em>really</em> not supposed to point a wand at -"</p>
<p>The wand's end twisted lightly beneath Bahry's hand just as the
boy whispered, "<em>Somnium</em>."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry stared at the Auror's crumpled body, there was no sense of
triumph, just a crushing sense of despair.</p>
<p>(Even then it might not have been too late.)</p>
<p>Harry turned to look at where the green snake lay
motionless.</p>
<p>"<em>Teacher?</em> " hissed Harry. "<em>Friend? Pleasse, are you
alive?</em> " An awful fear was taking hold in Harry's heart; in
that moment he had entirely forgotten that he'd just seen the
Defense Professor try to kill a police officer.</p>
<p>Harry pointed his wand at the snake, and his lips even began to
shape the word <em>Innervate</em>, before his brain caught up with
him and screamed at him.</p>
<p>He didn't dare use magic on Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>Harry had felt it, the burning, tearing pain in his head, like
his brain was about to split in half. He'd felt it, his magic and
Professor Quirrell's magic, matched and anti-harmonized in a
fulfillment of doom. That was the mysterious terrible thing that
would happen if Harry and Professor Quirrell ever got too close to
each other, or if they ever cast magic on each other, or if
<em>their spells ever touched,</em> their magic would resonate out
of control -</p>
<p>Harry stared at the snake, he couldn't tell if it was
breathing.</p>
<p>(The last seconds ticked away.)</p>
<p>He turned to stare at the Auror, who had seen the Boy-Who-Lived,
who knew.</p>
<p>The full magnitude of the disaster crushed in on Harry like a
thousand hundred-ton weights, he'd managed to stun the Auror but
now there was nothing left to do, no way to recover, the mission
had failed, everything had failed, <em>he</em> had failed.</p>
<p>Shocked, dismayed, despairing, he <em>didn't think of it</em>,
didn't see the obvious, didn't remember where the hopeless feelings
were coming from, didn't realize that he still needed to recast the
True Patronus Charm.</p>
<p>(And then it was already too late.)</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Auror Li and Auror McCusker had rearranged their chairs around
the table, and so they both saw it at the same time, the naked,
skeletally thin horror rising up to hover outside the window, the
headache already hitting them from seeing it.</p>
<p>They both heard the voice, like a long-dead corpse had spoken
words and those words themselves had aged and died.</p>
<p>The Dementor's speech hurt their ears as it said, "Bellatrix
Black is out of her cell."</p>
<p>There was a split second of horrified silence, and then Li tore
out of his chair, heading for the communicator to call in
reinforcements from the Ministry, even as McCusker grabbed his
mirror and started frantically trying to raise the three Aurors
who'd gone on patrol.</p>

<p>Saturday.</p>
<p>Harry had run into trouble falling asleep Friday night, which he
had anticipated might happen, and so he had decided to take the
obvious advance precaution of buying a sleeping potion; and to
prevent it from constituting a visible sign that he was nervous, he
had decided to buy it off Fred and George a couple of months
earlier. <em>(Be prepared, that's the Boy Scout's marching
song...)</em></p>
<p>Thus Harry was fully rested, and his pouch contained almost
everything which he owned and might conceivably need. Harry had, in
fact, run into the volume limitation on the pouch; and keeping in
mind that he would need to store a large snake, and might need to
store who-knew-what-else, he had removed some of the bulkier items,
like the car battery. He was up to the point now where he could
Transfigure something the size of a car battery in four minutes
flat, so it wasn't much of a loss.</p>
<p>Harry <em>had</em> kept the emergency flares and the
oxyacetylene welding torch and fuel tank, since you couldn't just
Transfigure things that were to be burned.</p>
<p><em>(Be prepared, as through life you march along...)</em></p>
<p>Mary's Place.</p>
<p>After the waitress had taken their order and bowed to them and
left the room, Professor Quirrell had performed only four Charms,
and then they'd talked about nothing of any vast consequence, just
Professor Quirrell's complex thesis about how the Dark Lord's curse
on the Defense position had led to the decline of dueling and how
this had changed social customs in magical Britain. Harry listened
and nodded and said intelligent things, while he tried to control
the pounding of his heart.</p>
<p>Then the waitress came in again bearing their food, and this
time, a minute after the waitress had departed, Professor Quirrell
gestured for the door to close and lock, and began to speak
twenty-nine security Charms, one of the ones in Mr. Bester's
sequence being left out this time, which somewhat puzzled
Harry.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell finished his Charms -</p>
<p>- stood up from his chair -</p>
<p>- blurred into a green snake, banded in blue and white -</p>
<p>- hissed, "<em>Hungry, boy? Eat your fill sswiftly, we sshall
need both sstrength and time.</em>"</p>
<p>Harry's eyes were a bit wide, but he hissed, "<em>I ate well at
breakfasst,</em>" and then rapidly began forking noodles into his
mouth.</p>
<p>The snake watched him for a moment, with those flat eyes, and
then hissed, "<em>Do not wissh to explain here. Prefer to be
elssewhere firsst. Need to leave unobsserved, without ssign we have
ever departed room.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Sso no one can track uss,</em>" hissed Harry.</p>
<p>"<em>Yess. Do you trusst me that much, boy? Think before
ansswer. I will have important requesst of you, which requiress
trusst; if ssay no regardlesss, then ssay no now.</em>"</p>
<p>Harry dropped his gaze from the snake's flat eyes, and looked
back down at his sauce-coated noodles, and ate another bite, then
another, while he thought.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor... was an ambiguous figure, to put it
mildly; Harry thought he had unraveled some of his goals, but
others remained mysterious.</p>
<p>But Professor Quirrell had knocked down two hundred girls to
stop the ones summoning Harry. Professor Quirrell had deduced that
the Dementor was draining Harry through his wand. The Defense
Professor had saved Harry's life, twice, in a two-week period.</p>
<p>Which could mean that the Defense Professor was just saving
Harry <em>for later,</em> that there were ulterior motives. Indeed,
it was <em>certain</em> that there were ulterior motives. Professor
Quirrell wasn't doing this on a whim. But then Professor Quirrell
had also seen Harry taught Occlumency, he had taught Harry how to
lose... if the Defense Professor wanted to make some use of Harry
Potter, it was a use that required a strengthened Harry Potter, not
a weakened one. That was what it meant to be used by a friend, that
they would want the use to make you stronger instead of weaker.</p>
<p>And if there was sometimes a cold atmosphere about the Defense
Professor, bitterness in his voice or emptiness in his gaze, then
Harry was the only one who Professor Quirrell allowed to see
it.</p>
<p>Harry didn't quite know how to describe in words the sense of
kinship he felt with Professor Quirrell, except to say that the
Defense Professor was the only <em>clear-thinking</em> person Harry
had met in the wizarding world. Sooner or later everyone else
started playing Quidditch, or not putting protective shells on
their time machines, or thinking that Death was their friend. It
didn't matter how good their intentions were. Sooner or later, and
usually sooner, they demonstrated that something deep inside their
brain was confused. Everyone except Professor Quirrell. It was a
bond that went beyond anything of debts owed, or even anything of
personal liking, that the two of them were alone in the wizarding
world. And if the Defense Professor occasionally seemed a little
scary or a little Dark, well, that was just the same thing some
people said about Harry.</p>
<p>"<em>I trusst you,</em>" hissed Harry.</p>
<p>And the snake explained the first stage of the plan.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry took a final forkful of noodles, chewed. Beside him,
Professor Quirrell, now in human form again, was eating his soup
placidly, as though nothing of special interest were occurring.</p>
<p>Then Harry swallowed, and in the same moment stood up from his
chair, already feeling his heart start to hammer hard in his chest.
The security precautions they were taking were literally the most
stringent possible...</p>
<p>"Are you ready to test it, Mr. Potter?" Professor Quirrell said
calmly.</p>
<p>It <em>wasn't</em> a test, but Professor Quirrell wouldn't say
that, not out loud in human speech, even in this room screened to
the limit that Professor Quirrell had secured with further
Charms.</p>
<p>"Yep," Harry said as casually as he could.</p>
<p><em>Step one.</em></p>
<p>Harry said "Cloak" to his pouch, drew forth the Cloak of
Invisibility, and then unstuck the pouch from his belt and threw it
toward the other side of the table.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor stood up from his own seat, drew his wand,
bent down, and touched his wand to the pouch, murmuring a quiet
incantation. The new enchantments would ensure that Professor
Quirrell could enter the pouch on his own in snakeform, and leave
it on his own, and hear what went on outside while he was in the
pouch.</p>
<p><em>Step two.</em></p>
<p>As Professor Quirrell stood up from where he'd bent over by the
pouch, and put away his wand, his wand happened to point in Harry's
direction, and there was a brief crawling sensation on Harry's
chest near where the Time-Turner lay, like something creepy had
passed very close by without touching him.</p>
<p><em>Step three.</em></p>
<p>The Defense Professor turned into a snake again, and the sense
of doom diminished; the snake crawled to the pouch and into it, the
pouch's mouth opening to admit the green shape, and as the mouth
closed again behind the tail, the sense of doom diminished
further.</p>
<p><em>Step four.</em></p>
<p>Harry drew his wand, being careful to stand still as he did it,
so that the Time-Turner would not move from where Professor
Quirrell had anchored the hourglass within the shell in its current
orientation. "<em>Wingardium Leviosa</em>," murmured Harry, and the
pouch began to float toward him.</p>
<p>Slowly, slowly, as Professor Quirrell had instructed, the pouch
began to float toward Harry, who waited alert for any sign the
pouch was opening, in which case Harry was to use the Hover Charm
to propel it away from him as fast as possible.</p>
<p>As the pouch came within a meter of Harry, the sense of doom
returned.</p>
<p>As Harry reattached the pouch to his belt, the sense of doom was
stronger than it had ever been, but still not overwhelming; it was
tolerable.</p>
<p>Even with Professor Quirrell's Animagus form lying within the
extended space of the pouch resting on Harry's very hip.</p>
<p><em>Step five.</em></p>
<p>Harry sheathed his wand. His other hand still held the Cloak of
Invisibility, and Harry drew that cloak over himself.</p>
<p><em>Step six.</em></p>
<p>And so in that room shielded from every possible scrying, which
Professor Quirrell had personally and further secured, it was not
until <em>after</em> Harry was wearing the true Cloak of
Invisibility that he reached beneath his shirt and twisted the
outer shell of the Time-Turner just once.</p>
<p>The Time-Turner's inner hourglass stayed anchored and
motionless, the setting twisted around it -</p>
<p>The food vanished from the table, the chairs leaped back into
place, the door sprang open.</p>
<p>Mary's Room was deserted, as it should have been, because
Professor Quirrell had earlier contacted Mary's Place under a false
name to inquire whether the room would be available at this hour -
not to reserve it, not to place a canceled reservation that might
be noted, but only to inquire.</p>
<p><em>Step seven.</em></p>
<p>Staying under the Cloak of Invisibility, Harry left through the
open door. He navigated the tiled hallways of Mary's Place to the
well-stocked bar that greeted new entrants, tended by the owner,
Jake. There were only a few people at the bar, in the morning
before proper lunchtime, and Harry had to wait invisibly by the
door for several minutes, listening to the murmur of conversation
and the gurgle of alcohol, before the door opened to admit a huge
genial Irishman, and Harry slipped out silently in his wake.</p>
<p><em>Step eight.</em></p>
<p>Harry walked for a while. He was well away from Mary's Place
when he turned off Diagon Alley into a smaller alley, at the end of
which lay a shop that was dark, the windows enchanted to
blackness.</p>
<p><em>Step nine.</em></p>
<p>"Sword fish melon friend," Harry spoke the passphrase to the
lock, and it clicked open.</p>
<p>Within the shop was also darkness, the light from the open door
briefly illuminating it to show a wide, empty room. The furniture
shop which had once operated here had gone bankrupt a few months
ago, according to the Defense Professor, and the shop had been
repossessed, but not yet resold. The walls were painted a simple
white, the wooden floor scratched and unpolished, a single closed
door set in the back wall; this had been a showroom, once, but now
it showed nothing.</p>
<p>The door clicked shut behind Harry, and then the darkness was
pitch and complete.</p>
<p><em>Step ten.</em></p>
<p>Harry took out his wand and said "<em>Lumos</em>", lighting the
room with white glow; he took his pouch from his belt (the sense of
doom growing a little sharper as he grasped it with his fingers)
and lightly tossed it to the opposite side of the room (the sense
of doom fading almost completely). And then he began to take off
the Cloak of Invisibility, even as his voice hissed, <em>"It iss
done.</em>"</p>
<p><em>Step eleven.</em></p>
<p>From the pouch poked a green head, followed shortly by a
meter-long green body as the snake slithered out. A moment later,
the snake blurred into Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p><em>Step twelve.</em></p>
<p>Harry waited in silence while the Defense Professor recited
thirty Charms.</p>
<p>"All right," Professor Quirrell said calmly, when he had
finished. "If anyone is still watching us now, we are in any case
doomed, so I will speak plainly and in human form. Parseltongue
does not quite suit me, I fear, as I am neither a descendant of
Salazar nor a true snake."</p>
<p>Harry nodded.</p>
<p>"So, Mr. Potter," said Professor Quirrell. His gaze intent, his
pale blue eyes dark and shadowed in the white light coming from
Harry's wand. "We are alone and unobserved, and I have an important
question to ask you."</p>
<p>"Go ahead," said Harry, his heart starting to beat faster.</p>
<p>"What is your opinion of the government of magical Britain?"</p>
<p>That wasn't quite what Harry had been expecting, but it was
close enough, so Harry said, "Based on my limited knowledge, I
would say that both the Ministry and the Wizengamot appear to be
stupid, corrupt, and evil."</p>
<p>"Correct," Professor Quirrell said. "Do you understand why I
ask?"</p>
<p>Harry took a deep breath, and looked Professor Quirrell straight
in the eyes, unflinching. Harry had finally worked out that the way
to make amazing deductions from scanty evidence was to know the
answer in advance, and he had guessed this answer fully a week ago.
It needed only a slight adjustment...</p>
<p>"You are about to invite me to join a secret organization full
of interesting people like yourself," said Harry, "one of whose
goals is to reform or overthrow the government of magical Britain,
and yes, I'm in."</p>
<p>There was a slight pause.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid that is not quite where I intended to direct this
conversation," said Professor Quirrell. The corners of his lips
were twitching slightly. "I merely planned to ask for your help in
doing something extremely treasonous and illegal."</p>
<p><em>Darn,</em> thought Harry. Still, Professor Quirrell hadn't
<em>denied</em> it... "Go on."</p>
<p>"Before I do," said Professor Quirrell. There was no levity in
his voice, now. "<em>Are</em> you open to such requests, Mr.
Potter? I say again that if you are likely to say no regardless,
you must say no now. If your curiosity impels you otherwise, squash
it."</p>
<p>"Treasonous and illegal doesn't bother me," said Harry. "Risks
bother me and the stakes would need to be commensurate, but I can't
imagine <em>you</em> taking risks frivolously."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell nodded. "I would not. It is a terrible abuse
of my friendship with you, and of such trust as is placed in my
teaching position at Hogwarts -"</p>
<p>"You can skip this part," Harry said.</p>
<p>The lips twitched again, and then went flat. "Then I shall skip
it. Mr. Potter, you sometimes make a game of lying with truths,
playing with words to conceal your meanings in plain sight. I, too,
have been known to find that amusing. But if I so much as
<em>tell</em> you what I hope we shall do this day, Mr. Potter, you
will <em>lie</em> about it. You will lie straight out, without
hesitation, without wordplay or hints, to anyone who asks about it,
be they foe or closest friend. You will lie to Malfoy, to Granger,
and to McGonagall. You will speak, always and without hesitation,
in <em>exactly</em> the fashion you would speak if you knew
nothing, with no concern for your honor. That also is how it must
be."</p>
<p>There was silence, then, for a time.</p>
<p>That was a price measured in a fraction of Harry's soul.</p>
<p>"Without telling me yet..." said Harry. "Can you say if the need
is desperate?"</p>
<p>"There is someone in the most terrible want of your help,"
Professor Quirrell said simply, "and there is no one who can help
them but you."</p>
<p>There was another silence, but not a long one.</p>
<p>"All right," Harry said quietly. "Tell me of the mission."</p>
<p>The dark robes of the Defense Professor seemed to blur against
the shadow on the wall, cast by his silhouette blocking the white
light of Harry's wand. "The ordinary Patronus Charm, Mr. Potter,
wards off a Dementor's fear. But the Dementors still see you
through it, they know that you are there. Only not your Patronus
Charm. It blinds them, or more than blinds them. What I saw beneath
the cloak wasn't even looking in our direction as you killed it; as
though it had forgotten our existence, even as it died."</p>
<p>Harry nodded. That wasn't surprising, not when you confronted a
Dementor on the level of its true existence, beyond
anthropomorphism. Death might be the last enemy, but it wasn't a
sentient enemy. When humanity had wiped out smallpox, smallpox
hadn't fought back.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter, the central branch of Gringotts is guarded by every
spell high and low that the goblins know. Even so those vaults have
been successfully robbed; for what wizardry can do, wizardry can
undo. And yet no one has ever escaped from Azkaban. No one. For
every Charm there is a counter-Charm, for every ward there is a
bypass. How can it be that no one has ever been rescued from
Azkaban?"</p>
<p>"Because Azkaban has something invincible," Harry said.
"Something so terrible that no one can defeat it."</p>
<p>That was the keystone of their perfect security, it had to be,
nothing human. It was Death that guarded Azkaban.</p>
<p>"The Dementors don't like their meals being taken away from
them," Professor Quirrell said. Coldness had entered that voice,
now. "They know if anyone tries. There are more than a hundred
Dementors there, and they speak to the guards as well. It's that
simple, Mr. Potter. If you're a powerful wizard then Azkaban isn't
hard to enter, and it isn't hard to leave. So long as you don't try
to take anything out of it that belongs to the Dementors."</p>
<p>"But the Dementors are <em>not</em> invincible," said Harry. He
could have cast the Patronus Charm with that thought, in that very
moment. "Never believe that they are."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's voice was very quiet. "Do you remember what
it was like when you went before the Dementor, the first time, when
you failed?"</p>
<p>"I remember."</p>
<p>And then with a sudden sickening lurch in his stomach, Harry
knew where this was going; he should have seen it before.</p>
<p>"There is an innocent person in Azkaban," Professor Quirrell
said.</p>
<p>Harry nodded, there was a burning sensation in his throat, but
he didn't cry.</p>
<p>"The one of whom I speak was not under the Imperius Curse," said
the Defense Professor, dark robes silhouetted against a greater
shadow. "There are surer ways to break wills than the Imperius, if
you have the time for torture, and Legilimency, and rituals of
which I will not speak. I cannot tell you how I know this, how I
know any of this, cannot hint at it even to you, you will have to
trust me. But there is a person in Azkaban who never once chose to
serve the Dark Lord, who has spent years suffering alone in the
most terrible cold and darkness imaginable, and never deserved a
single minute of it."</p>
<p>Harry saw it in a single leap of intuition, his mouth racing
almost ahead of his thoughts.</p>
<p><em>There was no hint, no warning, we all thought -</em></p>
<p>"A person by the name of Black," Harry said.</p>
<p>There was silence. Silence, while the pale blue eyes stared at
him.</p>
<p>"Well," said Professor Quirrell after a while. "So much for not
telling you the name until after you had accepted the mission. I
would ask whether you're reading <em>my</em> mind, but that's
flatly impossible."</p>
<p>Harry said nothing, but it was simple enough if you
<em>believed</em> in the processes of modern democracy. The most
obvious person in Azkaban to be innocent was the one who hadn't
gotten a trial -</p>
<p>"I am <em>certainly</em> impressed, Mr. Potter," said Professor
Quirrell. His face was grave. "But this is a serious matter, and if
there is some way others could make the same deduction, I
<em>must</em> know. So tell me, Mr. Potter. How in the name of
Merlin, of Atlantis, and the void between the stars, did you guess
that I was talking about Bellatrix?"</p>

<p>Silent, it was thankfully silent, the metal door on the next
level down. Either there wasn't someone behind there, or they were
hurting quietly, maybe they were screaming but their voice had
given out already, or they were just muttering quietly to
themselves in the dark...</p>
<p><em>I'm not sure I can do this,</em> Harry thought, and he
couldn't blame the despairing thought on the Dementors either. It
would be better to be lower, safer to be lower, his plan would take
time to implement and the Aurors were probably already working
their way down. But if Harry had to pass any more of those metal
doors while staying silent and keeping his breathing perfectly
regular, he might go mad; if he had to leave a piece of himself
behind at each one, soon there wouldn't be anything left of him
-</p>
<p>A luminous moonlit cat leaped into existence and landed in front
of Harry's Patronus. Harry almost screamed, which wouldn't have
helped his image with Bellatrix.</p>
<p>"Harry!" said the voice of Professor McGonagall, sounding as
alarmed as Harry had ever heard from her. "Where are you? Are you
all right? This is my Patronus, answer me!"</p>
<p>With a convulsive effort, Harry cleared his mind, repurposed his
throat, forced calm, swapped in a different personality like an
Occlumency barrier. It took a few seconds and he hoped like hell
that Professor McGonagall didn't notice a problem with that thanks
to the communications delay, just as he hoped like hell that
Patronuses didn't report on their surroundings.</p>
<p>A young boy's innocent voice said, "I'm in Mary's Place,
Professor, in Diagon Alley. Going to the restroom actually. What's
wrong?"</p>
<p>The cat leaped away, and Bellatrix began to chuckle softly,
dusty appreciative laughter, but she cut herself off abruptly at a
hiss from Harry.</p>
<p>A moment later the cat returned, and said in Professor
McGonagall's voice, "I'm coming to pick you up right now. Don't go
<em>anywhere</em>, if you're not around the Defense Professor don't
go back to him, don't say anything to anyone, I'll be there as
quickly as I can!"</p>
<p>And the bright cat blurred forward and vanished.</p>
<p>Harry glanced down at his watch, noting down the time, so that
after he got everyone out of here, and Professor Quirrell anchored
the Time-Turner again, he could go back and be in the restroom of
Mary's Place at the appropriate time...</p>
<p><em>You know,</em> said the problem-solving part of his brain,
<em>there's a limit to how many constraints you can add to a
problem before it</em> really is <em>impossible, you know
that?</em></p>
<p>It shouldn't have mattered, and it didn't really, it didn't
compare to the suffering of a single prisoner in Azkaban, and yet
Harry still found himself feeling very aware that if his plan
didn't end with him being picked up from Mary's Place just like
he'd never left, and the Defense Professor looking completely
innocent of any and all wrongdoing, Professor McGonagall was going
to <em>kill him.</em></p>

<p>As their team prepared to eat another bite of territory out of C
spiral, shielding and scanning before dispelling the previous
shield to their rear, Amelia was tapping her fingers on her hip and
wondering if she ought to consult the obvious expert. If only he
wasn't so -</p>
<p>Amelia heard the familiar crack of fire and knew what she would
see as she turned.</p>
<p>A third of her Aurors were spinning around and leveling their
wands on the old wizard in half-moon glasses and a long silver
beard who had appeared directly within their midst, a bright
red-golden phoenix on his shoulder.</p>
<p>"Hold your fire!" Polyjuice made it easy to forge the face, but
faking the phoenix travel would have been rather more difficult -
the wards permitted it as one of the fast ways into Azkaban, though
there were no fast ways out.</p>
<p>The old witch and the old wizard stared at each other for a long
moment.</p>
<p>(Amelia wondered, in the back of her mind, which of her Aurors
had sent the word, there were several former members of the Order
of the Phoenix with her; she tried to remember, in the back of her
mind, if she'd seen Emmeline's sparrow or Andy's cat missing from
the flock of bright creatures; but she knew that it was futile. It
might not even be any of her people, for the old meddler often knew
things he had no way at all of knowing.)</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore inclined his head to Amelia in a courteous
gesture. "I hope I am not unwelcome here," the wizard said calmly.
"We are all on the same side, are we not?"</p>
<p>"That depends," Amelia said in a hard voice. "Are you here to
help us catch criminals, or to protect them from the consequences
of their actions?" <em>Are you going to try to stop the killer of
my brother from getting her well-deserved Kiss, old meddler?</em>
From what Amelia heard, Dumbledore had gotten smarter toward the
end of the war, mostly due to Mad-Eye's nonstop nagging; but had
relapsed into his foolish mercies the instant Voldemort's body was
found.</p>
<p>A dozen small points of white and silver, reflections of the
shining animals, gleamed off the old wizard's half-moon glasses as
he spoke. "Even less than you would I see Bellatrix Black freed,"
the old wizard said. "She <em>must</em> not leave this prison
alive, Amelia."</p>
<p>Before Amelia could speak again, even to express her surprised
gratification, the old wizard gestured with his long black wand and
a blazing silver phoenix sprang into existence, brighter perhaps
than all their other Patronuses put together. It was the first time
she'd seen that spell cast wordlessly. "Order all your Aurors to
cancel their Patronus Charms for ten seconds," said the old wizard.
"What darkness cannot find, the light may."</p>
<p>Amelia snapped off the order to the communications officer, who
would notify all Aurors through their mirrors, commanding
Dumbledore's will to be done.</p>
<p>That took a few moments, and it became a period of awful
silence, none of the Aurors daring to speak, while Amelia tried to
weigh her own thoughts. <em>She must not leave this prison
alive...</em> Albus Dumbledore wouldn't turn into Bartemius Crouch
without a strong reason. If he'd meant to tell her <em>why</em>, he
already would have; but it certainly wasn't a positive sign.</p>
<p>Still, it was good to know they'd be able to work together on
this one.</p>
<p>"Now," said a chorus of mirrors, and all the Patronus Charms
winked out except that blazing silver phoenix.</p>
<p>"Is there another Patronus still present?" the old wizard said
clearly to the bright creature.</p>
<p>The bright creature dipped its head in a nod.</p>
<p>"Can you find it?"</p>
<p>The silver head nodded again.</p>
<p>"Will you remember it, should it depart and come again?"</p>
<p>A final nod from the blazing phoenix.</p>
<p>"It is done," Dumbledore said.</p>
<p>"Over," said all the mirrors a moment later, and Amelia raised
her wand and began recasting her own Patronus. (Though it took some
extra concentration, with that wolfish smile already on her face,
to think of the first time Susan had kissed her cheek, instead of
dwelling on the looming fate of Bellatrix Black. That other Kiss
was a happy thought indeed, but not quite the right kind for the
Patronus Charm.)</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>They hadn't even gotten to the end of that corridor before
Harry's Patronus raised its hand, politely, as though in a
classroom.</p>
<p>Harry thought quickly. The question was how to - no, that was
also obvious.</p>
<p>"It seems," Harry said in a coldly amused voice, "that someone
has instructed this Patronus to speak its message only to me." He
chuckled. "Well then. Pardon me, dear Bella. <em>Quietus.</em>"</p>
<p>At once the silver humanoid said in Harry's own voice, "There is
another Patronus which seeks this Patronus."</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " said Harry. And then, without pausing to think
about what was happening, "Can you block it? Stop it from finding
you?"</p>
<p>The silver humanoid shook its head.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>No sooner did Amelia and the other Aurors finish recasting their
Patronus Charms, when -</p>
<p>The blazing silver phoenix flew off, and the true red-golden
phoenix followed it, and the old wizard calmly strode after both of
them with his long wand gripped low.</p>
<p>The shields around their territory parted around the old wizard
like water, and closed behind him with hardly a ripple.</p>
<p>"<em>Albus!</em> " shouted Amelia. "What do you think you're
doing?"</p>
<p>But she already knew.</p>
<p>"Do not follow me," the old wizard's voice said sternly. "I can
protect myself, I cannot protect others."</p>
<p>The curse Amelia shouted after him made even her own Aurors
flinch.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>This isn't fair, isn't fair, isn't fair! There's a limit to
how many constraints you can add to a problem before it really is
impossible!</em></p>
<p>Harry blocked off the useless thoughts, ignored the fatigue he
was feeling, and forced his mind to confront the new requirements,
he had to think <em>fast,</em> use the adrenaline on following the
chains of logic quickly and without hesitation, instead of wasting
it on despair.</p>
<p>For the mission to succeed,</p>
<p>(1) Harry would have to dispel his Patronus.</p>
<p>(2) Bellatrix needed to be hidden from the Dementors after the
Patronus was dispelled.</p>
<p>(3) Harry needed to resist the Dementors' drain after his
Patronus was dispelled.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p><em>If I solve this one,</em> said Harry's brain, <em>I want a
cookie afterward, and if you make the problem any more difficult
than this, I mean the slightest bit more difficult, I am climbing
out of your skull and heading for Tahiti.</em></p>
<p>Harry and his brain considered the problem.</p>
<p>Azkaban had stood invincible for centuries, relying upon the
impossibility of evading the Dementors' gaze. So if Harry found
<em>another</em> way to hide Bellatrix from the Dementors, it would
rely on either his scientific knowledge or his realization that the
Dementors were Death.</p>
<p>Harry's brain suggested that an obvious way to stop the
Dementors from seeing Bellatrix was to make her stop existing,
i.e., kill her.</p>
<p>Harry congratulated his brain on thinking outside the box and
told it to continue searching.</p>
<p><em>Kill her and then bring her back,</em> came the next
suggestion. <em>Use Frigideiro to cool Bellatrix down to the point
where her brain activity stops, then warm her up afterward using
Thermos, just like people who fall into very cold water can be
successfully revived half-an-hour later without noticeable brain
damage.</em></p>
<p>Harry considered this. Bellatrix might not survive in her
debilitated state. <em>And</em> it might not stop Death from seeing
her. <em>And</em> he'd have trouble carrying a cold unconscious
Bellatrix very far. <em>And</em> Harry couldn't remember the
research on which exact body temperature was supposed to be
nonfatal but temporarily-brain-halting.</p>
<p>It was another good outside-the-box idea, but Harry told his
brain to keep thinking of...</p>
<p><em>...ways to hide from Death...</em></p>
<p>A frown moved over Harry's face. He'd heard something about
that, somewhere.</p>
<p><em>One of the requisites for becoming a powerful wizard is an
excellent memory,</em> Professor Quirrell had said. <em>The key to
a puzzle is often something you read twenty years ago in an old
scroll, or a peculiar ring you saw on the finger of a man you met
only once...</em></p>
<p>Harry focused as hard as he could, but he couldn't remember, it
was on the tip of his tongue but he couldn't remember; so he told
his subconscious to go on trying to recollect it, and refocused his
attention on the other half of the problem.</p>
<p><em>How can I protect myself from the Dementors without a
Patronus Charm?</em></p>
<p>The Headmaster had been repeatedly exposed to a Dementor from a
few steps away, over and over throughout a whole day, and had come
out of it looking merely tired. How had the Headmaster done that?
Could Harry do it too?</p>
<p>It could just be some random genetic thing, in which case Harry
was screwed. But assuming the problem <em>was</em> solvable...</p>
<p>Then the obvious answer was that Dumbledore wasn't afraid of
death.</p>
<p>Dumbledore <em>really</em> wasn't afraid of death. Dumbledore
honestly, truly believed that death was the next great adventure.
Believed it in his core, not just as convenient words used to
suppress cognitive dissonance, not just pretending to be wise.
Dumbledore had decided that death was the natural and normative
order, and whatever tiny lingering fear was still in him, it had
taken a long time and repeated exposures for the Dementor to drain
him through that small flaw.</p>
<p>That avenue was closed to Harry.</p>
<p>And then Harry thought of the flip side, the obvious inverse
question:</p>
<p><em>Why am I so much more vulnerable than average? Other
students didn't fall over when they faced the Dementor.</em></p>
<p>Harry meant to destroy Death, to end it if he could. He meant to
live forever, if he could; he had hope of it, the thought of Death
brought him no sense of despair or inevitability. He was not
blindly attached to his own life; indeed it had taken an effort
<em>not</em> to burn away all his life on the need to protect
others from Death. Why did the shadows of Death have such power
over Harry? He would not have thought himself so afraid.</p>
<p>Was it Harry, all along, who'd been rationalizing? Who was
secretly so afraid of death that it was twisting his own thoughts,
as Harry had accused Dumbledore?</p>
<p>Harry considered this, preventing himself from flinching away.
It felt uncomfortable, but...</p>
<p>But...</p>
<p>But uncomfortable thoughts weren't always <em>true</em>, and
this one didn't sound exactly right. Like there was a grain of
truth, but it wasn't hiding <em>where</em> the hypothesis said it
was -</p>
<p>And that was when Harry realized.</p>
<p><em>Oh.</em></p>
<p><em>Oh, I understand now.</em></p>
<p><em>The one who is afraid, is...</em></p>
<p>Harry asked his dark side what it thought of death.</p>
<p>And Harry's Patronus wavered, dimmed, almost went out upon the
instant, for that desperate, sobbing, screaming terror, an
unutterable fear that would do anything not to die, throw
everything aside not to die, that couldn't think straight or feel
straight in the presence of that absolute horror, that couldn't
look into the abyss of nonexistence any more than it could have
stared straight into the Sun, a blind terrified thing that only
wanted to find a dark corner and hide and not have to think about
it any more -</p>
<p>The silver figure had darkened to moonlight, was flickering like
a failing candle -</p>
<p><em>It's all right,</em> thought Harry, <em>it's all
right.</em></p>
<p>Visualizing himself cradling his dark side like a frightened
child in his arms.</p>
<p><em>It's right and proper to be horrified, because death is
horrible. You don't have to hide your horror, you don't have to
feel ashamed of it, you can wear it as a badge of honor, openly in
the Sun.</em></p>
<p>It was strange, to feel himself split in two like this, the
track of his thoughts that gave the comfort, the track of his
thoughts that followed his dark side's incomprehension at the
alienness of the ordinary Harry's thoughts; of all the things that
his dark side associated with its own fear of death, the one thing
it had never expected or imagined that it might find, was
acceptance and praise and help...</p>
<p><em>You don't have to fight alone,</em> Harry said silently to
his dark side. <em>The rest of me will back you up on this. I won't
let myself die, and I won't let my friends die either. Not you/I,
not Hermione, not Mum or Dad, not Neville or Draco or anyone, this
is the will to protect...</em> Visualizing wings of sunlight, like
the wings of the Patronus he had spread, to give shelter to that
frightened child.</p>
<p>The Patronus brightened again, the world spun around Harry or it
was his own mind that was spinning?</p>
<p><em>Take my hand,</em> Harry thought and visualized, <em>come
with me, and we will do this thing together...<br></em></p>
<p>There was a lurch in Harry's mind, like his brain had taken one
step to the left, or the universe had taken one step to the
right.</p>
<p>And in a brightly lit corridor in Azkaban, the dim gas lights
far outshone by the steady and unwavering light of a human-shaped
Patronus, an invisible boy stood with a strange small smile on his
face, shaking only slightly.</p>
<p>Harry knew, somehow, that he'd just done something significant,
something that went beyond just strengthening his resistance to
Dementors.</p>
<p>And more than that, he'd <em>remembered</em>. Thinking of Death
as an anthropomorphic figure had done the trick, ironically enough.
Now Harry could remember it, what was reputed to hide someone from
the gaze of Death himself...</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>In a corridor of Azkaban, a wizard's striding legs came to an
abrupt halt; for the bright silver thing that was his guide, had
halted in midair, fluttering its wings in distress. The brilliant
white phoenix craned its head, looking backward and forward as
though confused; and then it turned to its master and shook its
head in apology.</p>
<p>Without another word, the old wizard turned and strode back the
way he came.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry stood straight and upright, feeling the fear wash over him
and around him. Some tiny part of him might have been eroded a
little by the waves of emptiness that broke continually upon his
unmoving stone, but his limbs were not cold, and his magic was with
him. In time those waves might corrode him and consume him,
sneaking through whatever tiny part of him still cowered before
Death instead of using its fear to energize itself for battle. But
that doom would take time, with the shadows of Death far away and
uncaring of him. The flaw, the crack, the fault-line that was in
him had been repaired, and the stars blazed brightly in his mind,
vast and unafraid, and brilliant in the midst of cold and
darkness.</p>
<p>To anyone else's eyes, it would have seemed that the boy stood
alone in the dimly lit metal corridor, wearing that strange
smile.</p>
<p>For Bellatrix Black and the snake draped around her shoulders
were concealed by the Cloak of Invisibility, one of the three
Deathly Hallows and reputed to hide its wearer from the gaze of
Death himself. The riddle whose answer had been lost, and which
Harry had found anew.</p>
<p>And Harry knew, now, that the concealment of the Cloak was more
than the mere transparency of Disillusionment, that the Cloak kept
you <em>hidden</em> and not just invisible, as unseeable as were
Thestrals to the unknowing. And Harry also knew that it was
Thestral blood which painted the symbol of the Deathly Hallows on
the inside of the Cloak, binding into the Cloak that portion of
Death's power, enabling the Cloak to confront the Dementors on
their own level and block them. It had felt like guessing, and yet
a certain guess, the knowledge coming to him in the instant of
solving the riddle.</p>
<p>Bellatrix was still transparent within the Cloak, but to Harry
she was no longer hidden, he knew that she was there, as obvious to
him as a Thestral. For Harry had only loaned his Cloak, not given
it; and he had comprehended and mastered the Deathly Hallow that
had been passed down through the Potter line.</p>
<p>Harry gazed directly at the invisible woman, and said, "Can the
Dementors reach you, Bella?"</p>
<p>"No," said the woman in a soft, wondering voice. Then, "But my
Lord... <em>you</em>..."</p>
<p>"If you say anything foolish, it will annoy me," Harry said
coldly. "Or are you under the impression that I would sacrifice
myself for you?"</p>
<p>"No, my Lord," the Dark Lord's servant replied, sounding
puzzled, and perhaps awed.</p>
<p>"Follow," spoke Harry's cold whisper.</p>
<p>And they continued their journey downward, as the Dark Lord
reached into his pouch, and took a cookie, and ate it. If Bellatrix
had asked, Harry would have claimed it was for the chocolate, but
she didn't ask.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The old wizard strode back into the midst of the Aurors, the
silver and the red-golden phoenixes now following behind.</p>
<p>"<em>You -</em>" Amelia began to bellow.</p>
<p>"They have dismissed their Patronus," said Dumbledore. The old
wizard didn't seem to raise his voice but his calm words somehow
overrode her own. "I cannot find them now."</p>
<p>Amelia gritted her teeth, and put a number of scathing remarks
on hold, and turned to the communications officer. "Tell the duty
room to ask the Dementors <em>again</em> if they can sense
Bellatrix Black."</p>
<p>The communications specialist spoke to her mirror for a moment,
and a few seconds later, looked up, surprised. "No -"</p>
<p>Amelia was already cursing violently in her mind.</p>
<p>"- but they can see someone else on the lower levels who isn't a
prisoner."</p>
<p>"Fine!" snapped Amelia. "Tell the Dementor that a dozen of its
kind are authorized to enter Azkaban and seize whoever that is and
anyone in their company! And if they see Bellatrix Black, they're
to Kiss her immediately!"</p>
<p>Amelia turned and glared toward Dumbledore, then, daring him to
argue; but the old wizard only looked at her a bit sadly, and held
his peace.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Auror McCusker finished speaking to the corpse that drifted
outside the window, conveying the Director's orders.</p>
<p>The corpse gave him a deathly smile that almost unstrung his
limbs, and then floated downward.</p>
<p>Soon after, a dozen Dementors arose from where they had drifted
in the central pit of Azkaban, and headed outward, toward the walls
of the vast metal structure that towered above them.</p>
<p>Entering through holes set into the base of Azkaban, the darkest
of all creatures began their march of horror.</p>
</div>
<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 57: TSPE, Constrained Cognition, Pt
7<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>Harry had <em>hoped</em> that he'd just achieved fusion with his
mysterious dark side and would be enabled to draw on all of its
benefits with none of its drawbacks, call up the crystal clarity
and indomitable will on demand, without needing to go cold or
angry.</p>
<p>Once again, he'd overestimated how much progress he'd made.
<em>Something</em> had happened, but Harry still had a mysterious
dark side, it was still separate from him, and his ordinary self
was still domitable. And despite the repair work he'd done on his
dark side's fear of death, he didn't dare go dark while unshielded
in Azkaban, that was tempting fate way too much.</p>
<p>Which was unfortunate, because a bit of nondomitability would
have <em>sure come in handy about now.</em></p>
<p>What made it harder was that he couldn't slump against a wall,
couldn't break into tears, couldn't even heave a sigh. His dear
Bella was watching him and that wasn't the sort of thing her Dark
Lord would do.</p>
<p>"My Lord -" Bellatrix said. Her low voice was strained. "The
Dementors - they are coming - I can feel them, my Lord -"</p>
<p>"Thank you, Bella," said a dry voice, "I already know that."</p>
<p>Harry couldn't sense the holes in the world the same way as when
he'd been wearing the Deathly Hallow, but he could feel the empty
pull increasing in intensity. At first he'd mistaken it for the
result of descending a stairwell, until he and Bellatrix had
finished descending and the pull had gone on increasing. Then
decreased, as the Dementors moved away along the spiral, then
increased as they went up another flight of stairs... There were
Dementors within Azkaban itself now, and they were coming for him.
Of course they were. Harry might be resistant now, but he was not
<em>hidden.</em></p>
<p><em>New requirement,</em> Harry told his brain. <em>Find a way
of defeating Dementors that doesn't invoke my Patronus Charm.
Alternatively, find yet another way of hiding someone from
Dementors, besides the Cloak of Invisibility -</em></p>
<p><em>I quit,</em> said his brain. <em>Find yourself another piece
of computing substrate to solve your ridiculously overconstrained
problems.</em></p>
<p><em>I mean it,</em> thought Harry.</p>
<p><em>So do I,</em> said his brain. <em>Put up your Patronus Charm
and wait for the Aurors to find you. Be sensible. It's
over.</em></p>
<p><em>Give up...</em></p>
<p>The sucking emptiness seemed to pull harder, as he thought it;
and Harry realized what was happening, concentrated more intensely
on the stars, turned his mind away from the despair -</p>
<p><em>You know,</em> observed the logical side of him, <em>if
you're not allowed to think</em> any <em>negative thoughts because
that will open your mind to the Dementors,</em> that's <em>a
cognitive bias too, how would you know if it actually</em> was
<em>time to give up?</em></p>
<p>A desperate sobbing scream rose up from below, words mixed in
like "no" and "away". The prisoners knew, the prisoners could feel
it.</p>
<p>The Dementors were coming.</p>
<p>"My Lord, you - you should not risk yourself for me - take back
your Cloak -"</p>
<p>"Be silent, fool," hissed an angry voice. "When I decide to
sacrifice you I will tell you so."</p>
<p><em>She's got a valid point,</em> said Slytherin. <em>You</em>
shouldn't <em>risk yourself for her, there's no way her life is as
valuable as yours.</em></p>
<p>For an instant Harry considered sacrificing Bellatrix to save
himself -</p>
<p>And in that moment, some of the dim orange gas-light seemed to
flee the corridor, a touch of cold crept over Harry's fingertips.
And he knew, then, that to think of leaving Bellatrix to the
shadows of Death, would make him vulnerable once more. Even in the
moment of making the decision, he might become unable to cast the
Patronus Charm, for he would have given up the thought that had
saved him before.</p>
<p>It occurred to Harry that he could still take the Cloak from
Bellatrix afterward, even if he couldn't cast the Patronus Charm;
and then he had to wrench his thoughts away from that option, focus
firmly on his decision <em>not</em> to do it, or he might have just
fallen over where he stood. For the whirlpool of emptiness swirling
around him was now deadly strong; there were screams coming from
<em>above</em>, and the screams below had stopped.</p>
<p><em>This is ridiculous,</em> said his logical side. <em>Rational
agents shouldn't have to put up with this sort of censored
reasoning process, all the theorems assume that how you think
doesn't affect reality apart from your actual actions, which is why
you're free to choose an optimal algorithm without worrying about
how your thoughts interact with Dementors -</em></p>
<p>...</p>
<p><em>That is a really dumb idea,</em> said Gryffindor. <em>Even I
think it's a dumb idea and I'm your Gryffindor side. You're not
seriously going to just stand there and -</em></p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"We have a fix!" shouted Ora, holding up her magic mirror as
though in triumph. "The Dementor outside the inner wall pointed to
level seven, C spiral, that's where they are!"</p>
<p>Her Aurors were looking at her expectantly.</p>
<p>"No," Amelia said in a level voice. "That's where <em>one</em>
of them is. The Dementors still can't find Bellatrix Black. We are
not running down there and letting her through in the confusion,
and we are not dividing our forces to be ambushed. So long as we
move with caution, we can't lose. Tell Scrimgeour and Shacklebolt
to keep going down level by level, same as before -"</p>
<p>The old wizard was already striding forward. Amelia didn't even
bother cursing him, this time, as once again their carefully
constructed shields parted like water and rippled gently in his
wake.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry waited at the beginning of the corridor, just next to the
stairs leading upward. Bellatrix and the snake were behind him,
concealed by the Deathly Hallow that Harry had mastered; he knew,
though he could not see, that the emaciated sorceress was sitting
upon the stairs, slumped back, since Harry had withdrawn his Hover
Charm to free up his mind and magic.</p>
<p>Harry's eyes were fixed on the far end of the corridor, next to
the stairs that led downward. Not in his mind now, but in true
reality, the light in the corridor had dimmed, the temperature had
fallen. The fear thundered over him and around him like a sea
whipped by hurricane winds, and the sucking emptiness had become a
howling draw toward some approaching black hole.</p>
<p>Up the stairs at the far end, floating smoothly through the
dying air, came the voids, the absences, the wounds in the
world.</p>
<p>And Harry expected them to stop.</p>
<p>With all the will and focus he could muster, Harry <em>expected
them to stop.</em></p>
<p>Anticipated their stopping.</p>
<p>Believed they would stop.</p>
<p>...that was the idea, anyway...</p>
<p>Harry shut down the dangerous stray thought, and <em>expected
the Dementors to halt.</em> They had no intelligence of their own,
they were just wounds in the world, their form and structure was
borrowed from others' expectations. People had been able to
negotiate with them, offer them victims in exchange for
cooperation, only because they <em>believed Dementors would
bargain.</em> So if Harry believed hard enough that the voids would
turn and go, they would turn and go.</p>
<p>But the wounds in the world kept coming, the swirling fear
seemed like a solid thing now, the emptiness tearing at matter as
well as mind, substance as well as spirit, you could see the metal
beginning to tarnish as the holes in the world passed.</p>
<p>A small sound came from behind him, from Bellatrix, but she said
no word, for she had been instructed to remain silent.</p>
<p><em>Don't think of them as creatures, think of them as
psychosensitive objects, they can be controlled if I can control
myself -</em></p>
<p>The problem was that he <em>couldn't</em> control himself so
easily, couldn't make himself believe blue was green by an act of
will. Couldn't suppress all those thoughts about how irrational it
was to <em>make</em> yourself believe something. How
<em>impossible</em> it was to trick yourself into believing
something if you <em>knew</em> that was what you were doing. All
the training Harry had given himself against self-deception was
refusing to switch off <em>no matter how harmful it was in this
unique special case -</em></p>
<p>The shadows of Death crossed the halfway point of the corridor,
and Harry held up his hand, fingers spread, and said in a voice of
firm and confident command, "Stop."</p>
<p>The shadows of Death stopped.</p>
<p>Behind Harry, Bellatrix gave a strangled gasp, like it was being
torn out of her.</p>
<p>Harry gestured to her, the signal he had set up in advance which
meant, <em>repeat what you heard the Dementors say.</em></p>
<p>"They say," Bellatrix said, her voice was shaking, "they said,
'Bellatrix Black was promised us. Tell us where she hides, and you
will be spared.'"</p>
<p>"Bellatrix?" Harry said, making his voice sound amused. "She
escaped a while ago."</p>
<p>A moment later, Harry realized that he should have said that
Bellatrix was among the Aurors in the top level, that would have
caused more confusion -</p>
<p>No, it was wrong to think of the Dementors as trickable, they
were merely <em>things,</em> they were controlled only by
<em>expectations -</em></p>
<p>"They say," Bellatrix said in a cracked voice, "they say they
know you're lying."</p>
<p>The voids began to move forward again.</p>
<p><em>Her anticipations are more solidly believed than mine; she
is controlling them, unwittingly -</em></p>
<p>"Don't resist," Harry said, pointing his wand behind him.</p>
<p>"I, I love you, farewell, my Lord -"</p>
<p>"<em>Somnium.</em>"</p>
<p>It had helped, strangely enough, hearing those particular awful
words, understanding Bellatrix's mistake; it reminded Harry why he
was fighting.</p>
<p>"Stop," Harry said again. Bellatrix was asleep; now only his own
will, his own expectations rather, should control those spheres of
annihilation -</p>
<p>But they kept on gliding forward, and Harry couldn't stop
himself from worrying that the previous experience had damaged his
confidence, which meant that he <em>wouldn't</em> be able to stop
them, and as he noticed himself thinking that, he doubted even more
- he needed more time to prepare, really ought to practice
controlling just one Dementor in a cage first -</p>
<p>There was only a quarter of corridor now between Harry and the
shadows of death, the empty winds were so strong that Harry could
feel the erosion beginning in the cracks of himself.</p>
<p>And the thought came to Harry that maybe he was wrong, maybe
Dementors <em>did</em> have their own desires and planning
capability. Or maybe they were controlled by how <em>everyone</em>
thought they worked, not just whoever was closest to them. And in
either case -</p>
<p>Harry drew up his wand into the starting position for the
Patronus Charm, and spoke.</p>
<p>"One of your number went to Hogwarts and did not return. It no
longer exists; that Death is dead."</p>
<p>The Dementors halted, a dozen wounds in the world stood
motionless, while the emptiness screamed around them like a deadly
wind to nowhere.</p>
<p>"Turn and go and do not speak of this to anyone, little shadows,
or I will destroy you as well."</p>
<p>Harry's fingers slid into the starting position for the Patronus
Charm, and readied himself to cast it; in his mind, the Earth shone
among the stars, the day side bright and blue with reflected
sunlight, the night side glimmering with the light of human cities.
Harry wasn't bluffing, wasn't trying to do anything tricky with his
thoughts. The shadows of Death would move forward and be
annihilated, or they would depart, he was equally ready for
either...</p>
<p>And the voids retreated back as smoothly as they came, the winds
of nothingness lessening with each meter they traversed, as they
slid back down the stairs, and departed.</p>
<p>Whether they truly had their own pseudo-intelligence, or whether
Harry had finally succeeded in <em>expecting</em> them to go...
that, Harry didn't know.</p>
<p>But they were gone.</p>
<p>Harry took a moment to sit down beside the unconscious Bellatrix
on the stairs, and slumped down as she was slumped, closing his
eyes for a moment, only a moment, he sure as hell wasn't planning
to sleep in Azkaban, but he needed to take that moment. The Aurors
would still be going down the stairs slowly, Harry hoped, so it
wouldn't hurt to take just five minutes to rest. Harry was careful
to keep his thoughts positive, cheerful, <em>my, I'll just have
some nice regenerative rest here, and then I'll feel better,</em>
rather than, say, <em>my, I'll just collapse in emotional and
physical exhaustion,</em> because the Dementors hadn't yet
retreated very far.</p>
<p><em>And by the way,</em> Harry said to his brain, <em>you're
fired.</em></p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"I found him!" cried the old wizard's voice.</p>
<p><em>Who?</em> thought Amelia, as she turned to see Dumbledore's
return, carrying in his arms -</p>
<p>- the one sight, the one person, she would never have expected
to behold -</p>
<p>- a man in torn red robes, looking scorched like he'd fought a
small war, blood dried on many cuts. His eyes were open, and he was
chewing on a bar of chocolate, held in his one living hand.</p>
<p>Bahry One-Hand was <em>alive.</em></p>
<p>A glad cry went up, her Aurors lowering their wands, some of
them already starting to rush forward.</p>
<p>"<em>Stay on guard!</em> " bellowed Amelia. "Check them both for
Polyjuice - scan Bahry for small Animagi or traps -"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"<em>Innervate. Wingardium Leviosa.</em>"</p>
<p>There was a pause. Harry sensed, though he could not quite see,
that the invisible woman was pushing herself to her feet, and
turning her head to look around. "I'm... alive...?"</p>
<p>Harry was sorely tempted to say no, just to see what she made of
that. Instead he hissed, "Don't ask stupid questions."</p>
<p>"What happened?" whispered Bellatrix.</p>
<p>And the Dark Lord gave a wild, high-pitched laugh, and said, "I
scared the Dementors away, my dear Bella."</p>
<p>There was a pause. Harry wished he could see Bellatrix's face;
had he said the wrong thing?</p>
<p>After a time, in a quavering voice, "Could it be, my Lord, that
in your new form, you have begun to care for me -"</p>
<p>"No," Harry said coldly, and turned from her (though he kept his
wand on her), and began walking. "And take care that you do not
offend me again, or I will abandon you here, use or no use. Now
follow, or be left behind; I have work to do."</p>
<p>Harry strode forward, not listening to the gasping sounds that
came from behind him; he knew Bellatrix was following.</p>
<p>...because the last thing that woman needed, the very last thing
she needed to start thinking before the psychiatric healer began
trying to deprogram her, was to believe that her Dark Lord could
ever love her back.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The old wizard smoothed his silver beard contemplatively,
looking at where Auror Bahry was being carried out of the room by
two strong Aurors.</p>
<p>"Do you understand this, Amelia?"</p>
<p>"No," she said simply. She suspected some trap they hadn't yet
been able to fathom, which was why Auror Bahry was going to be kept
outside the main party and guarded.</p>
<p>"Perhaps," the old wizard said at length, "whichever of their
number can cast the Patronus Charm, is more than a simple hostage.
Someone who was tricked into this, mayhap? For whatever reason,
they left your Auror alive; let us not be the first to wield deadly
curses, when we find them -"</p>
<p>"I see," said the old witch in sudden realization,
"<em>that</em> was their plan. It costs them nothing to Oblivate
him and leave him alive, and makes <em>us</em> hesitate -" Amelia
nodded decisively, and said to her people, "We carry on as
before."</p>
<p>The old wizard sighed. "Any news from the Dementors?"</p>
<p>"If I tell you," Amelia snapped, "will you run off again?"</p>
<p>"It costs you nothing, Amelia," the old wizard said quietly,
"and may save one of your own people the fight."</p>
<p><em>Costs me nothing except my chance at vengeance -</em></p>
<p>But that was nothing compared to the other, the annoying old
wizard was often right in the end, it was part of what made him so
annoying.</p>
<p>"The Dementors have ceased to answer questions about the other
person they said they saw," Amelia told him, "and they will not say
why, nor where."</p>
<p>Dumbledore turned to the blazing silver phoenix on his shoulder,
whose light illuminated the whole corridor, and received a silent
headshake in reply. "I cannot detect them either," said Dumbledore.
Then he shrugged. "I suppose I shall just walk the whole spiral
from top to bottom and see if anything turns up, shall I?"</p>
<p>Amelia would have ordered him not to do it, if she thought that
would have made the tiniest difference.</p>
<p>"Albus," said Amelia as the old wizard turned to depart, "even
you can be ambushed."</p>
<p>"Nonsense, my dear," the old wizard said cheerfully as he strode
off yet again, waving as though in admonition his fifteen-inch wand
of unidentifiable dark-grey wood, "I'm invincible."</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>("He didn't just really say that -" whispered the newest Auror
present, a still-prim young lady by the name of Noelle Curry, to
the senior member of her trio, Auror Brooks. "Did he?")</p>
<p>("He can get away with it," Isabel whispered back to her, "he's
<em>Dumbledore,</em> not even Fate takes him seriously
anymore.")</p>
<p>"And that," Amelia said heavily, for the benefit of the younger
Aurors, "is why we never call him in on anything unless we
absolutely must."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry lay very still on the hard bench that served as the bed of
this cell, a blanket pulled over him, staying as absolutely
motionless as he could while he waited for the fear to return.
There was a Patronus approaching, and a powerful one. Bellatrix was
hidden by a Deathly Hallow, no easy Charm would penetrate that; but
Harry did not know what other arts the Aurors might employ to
detect his own self, and dared not reveal his ignorance by asking
her. So Harry lay on a hard bed, in a cell with a locked door, and
the mighty metal door locked behind him, in absolute darkness, with
a thin blanket pulled over him, hoping that whoever it was wouldn't
look in, or wouldn't look too closely if they did -</p>
<p>That wasn't a point Harry could affect, really, that part of his
fate lay entirely in the hands of the Hidden Variables. Most of his
mind was concentrating on the ongoing Transfiguration he was
performing.</p>
<p>Listening in the silence, Harry heard the quick footsteps
approach; they paused outside his door, and then -</p>
<p>- continued onward.</p>
<p>Soon the fear returned.</p>
<p>Harry didn't allow himself to notice his own relief, any more
than he allowed himself to notice the fear. He was holding in his
mind the form of a Muggle device rather larger than a car battery,
and slowly applying that Form to the substance of an ice cube
(which Harry had frozen using <em>Frigideiro</em> on water from a
bottle in his pouch). You weren't supposed to Transfigure things to
be burned, but between the original substance being water, and the
Bubble-Head Charm to protect their air supply, Harry hoped that
this wouldn't make him or anyone else sick.</p>
<p>Now it was just a question of whether there would be enough time
before the Aurors did a detailed check on this cell block, for
Harry to finish this Transfiguration, and the partial
Transfiguration he would do after that -</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>When the old wizard strode back empty-handed, even Amelia began
to feel a twinge of worry. She and the other two Auror teams had
worked a third of the way down the three spirals, in synchrony so
as not to allow any gap in their coverage that could be jumped by
cutting through a ceiling, and they'd yet to find any sign.</p>
<p>"Might I ask you to report?" Amelia said, keeping the edge out
of her voice.</p>
<p>"First a simple walk from top to bottom," said the old wizard.
He was frowning, wrinkling his face even more than usual. "I
examined Bellatrix's cell, and found a death doll left in her
place. This escape was meant to go unremarked, I think. There is
something hidden in the corner beneath a scrap of cloth; I left
that undisturbed for your Aurors to examine. On the return trip, I
opened each door and looked within the cells. I saw nothing
Disillusioned, only the prisoners -"</p>
<p>They were interrupted by a scream from the red-golden phoenix,
and all her Aurors flinched from it. Condemnation was in it, and an
urgent demand that almost started Amelia running from the corridor
on the spot.</p>
<p>"- in rather distressing condition," Dumbledore said quietly.
For a moment the blue eyes were very cold beneath the half-moon
glasses. "Will any of you speak to me of the consequences of their
actions?"</p>
<p>"<em>I</em> did not -" Amelia began.</p>
<p>"I know," said the old wizard. "My apologies, Amelia." He
sighed. "Some of the more recent prisoners had scraps of their
magic left, when I looked upon them, but I sensed no uneaten power;
the strongest had only as much magic left as a first-year child. I
heard Fawkes scream in distress many times, but never challenge. It
seems you shall have to continue your search; they can hide well
enough to escape my mere glance."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>When Harry finished his first Transfiguration, he sat up, pulled
back the blanket that had covered him, cast a quick <em>Lumos,</em>
glanced at his watch, and was shocked to see that nearly an hour
and thirty minutes had passed. How much of that time had gone by
since someone had opened the door and then closed it again - Harry
hadn't been looking in that direction, of course - that, Harry
couldn't guess.</p>
<p>"My Lord...?" whispered Bellatrix's voice, soft and very
tentative.</p>
<p>"You may speak now," Harry said. He'd told her to remain silent
while he worked.</p>
<p>"That was Dumbledore who looked upon us."</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>"Interesting," Harry said neutrally. He was glad he had not
noticed this at the time. That sounded like a <em>rather close
shave</em>.</p>
<p>Harry said a word to his pouch, and began drawing forth the
magical device that he would mate to the product of his hour's
labor. Then, when that was drawn forth, another word brought forth
a tube of industrial-strength glue; before using it, Harry cast the
Bubble-Head Charm on himself and Bellatrix, and had Bellatrix cast
the same Charm on the snake, so that the glue fumes in the enclosed
cell would not harm them.</p>
<p>When the glue had begun to set, binding technology to magic,
Harry laid it down upon the bed, and sat down on the floor, resting
his magic and will for a moment before essaying the next
Transfiguration.</p>
<p>"My Lord..." Bellatrix said hesitantly.</p>
<p>"Yes?" said the dry voice.</p>
<p>"What is that device you made?"</p>
<p>Harry thought rapidly. It seemed like a good chance to check his
plans with her, under the guise of leading questions.</p>
<p>"Consider, my dear Bella," said Harry smoothly. "How difficult
is it for a powerful wizard to cut the walls of Azkaban?"</p>
<p>There was a pause, and then Bellatrix's voice came, slow and
puzzled, "Not difficult at all, my Lord...?"</p>
<p>"Indeed," said the dry, high voice of Bella's master. "Suppose
one were to do this, and fly through the hole on a broomstick, and
soar up and away. Rescuing a prisoner from Azkaban would seem easy
then, would it not?"</p>
<p>"But my Lord..." said Bella. "The Aurors would - they have their
own broomsticks, my Lord, fast ones -"</p>
<p>Harry listened, it was as he had thought. The Dark Lord replied,
again in tones of smoothly Socratic inquiry, and Bellatrix asked a
further question, which Harry had not expected, but Harry's own
counterquestion showed that it should not matter in the end. And in
response to Bellatrix's last question, the Dark Lord only smiled,
and said that it was time for him to resume his work.</p>
<p>And then Harry got up from the floor of the cell, went to the
far end of the cells, and touched his wand to the hard surface of
the wall - the wall of Azkaban, the solid metal that separated them
from direct exposure to the Dementors' pit.</p>
<p>And Harry began a partial Transfiguration.</p>
<p>This spell would go faster, Harry hoped. He'd spent hours and
hours practicing the unique magic, which had made it routine, not
much more difficult for him than ordinary Transfiguration. The
shape he was changing had not all that much total volume, the
Transfigured shape might be tall and wide and long, but it was very
thin. Half a millimeter, Harry had thought, would be enough,
considering the perfect smoothness...</p>
<p>On the long bench that served as a prison bed, where Harry had
set down the Transfigured technological device and the mated magic
item for the glue to dry, tiny letters in golden script gleamed on
the Muggle artifact. Harry hadn't really <em>planned</em> for them
to be there, but they'd kept running through the back of his mind,
and so seemed to have become part of the Transfigured form.</p>
<p>There were many different things Harry could have said before
using this particular triumph of technological ingenuity. Any
number of things that would be, in one sense or another,
appropriate. Or at least things that Harry <em>could</em> have
said, <em>would</em> have said, if Bellatrix had not been
there.</p>
<p>But there was only one thing to say, that Harry would only get
the chance to say just this once, and probably never get a better
chance to say ever again. (Or <em>think,</em> anyway, if he
couldn't say it.) He hadn't seen the actual movie, but he'd seen a
preview, and for some reason the phrase had stuck in his mind.</p>
<p>The tiny golden letters upon the Muggle device said,</p>
<p><em>All right, you primitive screwheads! Listen up!</em></p>

<p>"All right you primitive screwheads! Listen up! You see this?
This... is my <em>boomstick!</em> "</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>In darkness absolute, a boy stood holding his wand to the solid
metal wall of Azkaban, essaying a magic that only three other
people in the world would have believed possible, and that none
save he alone could wield.</p>
<p>Of course a powerful wizard could've cut through the wall in
seconds, with a gesture and a word.</p>
<p>For an average adult it might have been a matter of a few
minutes' work, and afterward they would have been winded.</p>
<p>But to accomplish the same end as a first-year Hogwarts student,
you had to be <em>efficient.</em></p>
<p>Luckily - well, not <em>luckily</em>, luck had nothing to do
with it - <em>conscientiously</em>, Harry had practiced
Transfiguration for an extra hour every day, to the point where he
was ahead of even Hermione in that one class; he'd practiced
partial Transfiguration to the point where his thoughts had begun
taking the true universe for granted, so that it required only
slightly more effort to keep its timeless quantum nature in mind,
even as he kept a firm mental separation between the concept of
Form and the concept of substance.</p>
<p>And the <em>problem</em> with that art having become so
routine...</p>
<p>...was that Harry could think about other things while he was
doing it.</p>
<p>Somehow his thoughts had managed to not go there, to not
confront the obvious, until he was faced with the prospect of
<em>really actually doing it in just a few minutes</em>.</p>
<p>What Harry was about to do...</p>
<p>...was dangerous.</p>
<p>Really dangerous.</p>
<p>Someone-might-actually-genuinely-get-killed dangerous.</p>
<p>Facing down twelve Dementors without a Patronus Charm had been
<em>scary,</em> but merely scary. Harry could have cast the
Patronus Charm, <em>would</em> have cast it as soon as he thought
he was in danger of not being able to do so, as soon as he felt his
resistance beginning to fail. And even if that hadn't worked...
even so, unless the Dementors had been instructed to Kiss anyone
they found, failure shouldn't have been <em>fatal.</em></p>
<p>This was different.</p>
<p>The Transfigured Muggle device could explode and kill them.</p>
<p>The interface between the technology and the magic could fail in
any number of ways and kill them.</p>
<p>The Aurors could get in a lucky shot.</p>
<p>It was just, well...</p>
<p><em>Seriously</em> dangerous.</p>
<p>Harry had caught his mind trying to argue itself into believing
that it was safe.</p>
<p>And sure, the whole thing <em>could</em> work, but...</p>
<p>But even leaving out that rationalists weren't ever allowed to
argue themselves into things, Harry knew he couldn't possibly have
argued himself into estimating less than a 20% probability of
dying.</p>
<p><em>Lose,</em> said Hufflepuff.</p>
<p><em>Lose</em>, said the voice of Professor Quirrell in his
mind.</p>
<p><em>Lose,</em> said his mental model of Hermione and Professor
McGonagall and Professor Flitwick and Neville Longbottom and, well,
basically everyone Harry knew except for Fred and George, who would
have gone for it in a hot second.</p>
<p>He should just go find Dumbledore and turn himself in. He
should, he really really should, it was the only <em>sane</em>
thing to do at this point.</p>
<p>And if it'd been only Harry on the mission, only his own life
that'd been at stake, he would have; he surely would have.</p>
<p>The part that was almost causing him to lose his concentration
on the partial Transfiguration he was performing, the part that was
threatening to open him to the Dementors...</p>
<p>...was Professor Quirrell, still unconscious, still a snake.</p>
<p>If Professor Quirrell went to Azkaban for his part in the
escape, he would die. He probably wouldn't last even a week. He was
that sensitive.</p>
<p>It was that simple.</p>
<p>If Harry <em>lost</em> here...</p>
<p>He lost Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p><em>Even though he's probably evil,</em> said the Hufflepuff
part of him quietly. <em>Even so?</em></p>
<p>It wasn't a decision that Harry had made in any conscious way.
He just couldn't do it. Losing was for House points, not
<em>people.</em></p>
<p><em>If you think your own life is valuable enough that you're
not willing to take on an eighty percent probability of dying in
order to protect all the prisoners in Azkaban,</em> his Slytherin
side observed, <em>there's no way you can justify taking a twenty
percent risk to your life to save Bellatrix and Professor Quirrell.
The math doesn't add up, you can't be assigning consistent
utilities over outcomes here.</em></p>
<p>The logical side of him noted that Slytherin had just won the
argument.</p>
<p>Harry kept the Form in his mind, kept on casting the spell. He
could always just abort the mission when he was <em>done</em> with
the Transfiguration, he didn't want to lose the effort he'd already
invested.</p>
<p>And then Harry thought of something else that suddenly made it
very hard to keep the magic going, very hard to keep up his
resistance to the Dementors.</p>
<p><em>What if the portkey doesn't take us where Professor Quirrell
said it did?</em></p>
<p>It was obvious in retrospect the moment he thought about it.</p>
<p>Even if the planned escape went completely right, even if the
Muggle device worked and <em>didn't</em> explode and
<em>didn't</em> interact badly with the mated magic item, even if
the Aurors didn't get in a lucky shot, even if Harry made it far
enough away from Azkaban to use the portkey...</p>
<p>...there might not be a psychiatric healer at the end of it.</p>
<p>That was something Harry had believed when he'd trusted
Professor Quirrell, and he'd forgotten to re-evaluate it after
Professor Quirrell was no longer to be trusted.</p>
<p><em>You can't do this,</em> said Hufflepuff. <em>At this point
we're talking mere stupidity.</em></p>
<p>Cold seemed to spread through the room, but Harry kept the
Transfiguration going, even as his resistance against the Dementors
faltered.</p>
<p><em>I can't lose Professor Quirrell.</em></p>
<p><em>He tried to kill a police officer,</em> said Hufflepuff.
<em>You already lost him, in that moment. Bellatrix is probably
just what everyone thinks she is. Just take your Cloak back, go
find Dumbledore and tell him you were tricked.</em></p>
<p><em>No,</em> thought Harry desperately, <em>not without talking
to Professor Quirrell, there might be an explanation, I don't know,
maybe he was standing far enough away from my Patronus that the
Dementors got to him... I don't understand, it doesn't make sense
on any hypothesis, why he would do that... I can't
just...<br></em></p>
<p>Harry turned his mind away from that chain of thought before it
completely broke his resistance to the fear, because he couldn't
think of feeding Professor Quirrell to Dementors while staying
resolved against Death, it was a cognitive impossibility.</p>
<p><em>Your reasoning is artificially impaired,</em> observed the
logical part of him calmly, <em>find a way to unimpair it.</em></p>
<p><em>All right, let's just generate alternatives,</em> Harry
thought. <em>Not choose, not weigh, certainly not commit... just
think about what else I might be able to do besides the original
plan.</em></p>
<p>And Harry went on cutting the hole in the wall. He was using
partial Transfiguration on a thin cylindrical shell of metal, two
meters in diameter and half a millimeter thick, running all the way
through the wall. He was Transfiguring that half-millimeter
thickness of metal into motor oil. Motor oil was a liquid and you
weren't to Transfigure liquids because they might evaporate, but he
and Bellatrix and the snake all had Bubble-Head Charms. And Harry
would cast Finite on the oil immediately after, dispelling his own
Transfiguration...</p>
<p>...as soon as the separated and lubricated hunk of metal slid
out of the wall and onto the floor of their cell, he'd slanted it
so gravity would pull it in, once the Transfiguration was done.</p>
<p>If Harry and Bellatrix <em>didn't</em> exit on his broomstick
through the resulting hole in the wall...</p>
<p>Harry's brain suggested that he could try to Transfigure a
surface cover over the hole in the wall, leaving a space for
Bellatrix and Professor Quirrell to hide in, wearing the Cloak,
while Harry turned himself in. And Professor Quirrell would
eventually wake up, and he and Bellatrix could try to figure out
how to exit Azkaban on their own.</p>
<p>It was, first of all, a dumb idea, and second, there would still
be a huge hunk of metal on the floor of the cell, which would give
it away.</p>
<p>And then Harry's brain saw the obvious.</p>
<p><em>Let Bellatrix and Professor Quirrell use the escape route
you invented. You stay behind, and turn yourself in.</em></p>
<p>Bellatrix and Professor Quirrell were the ones whose lives were
at stake.</p>
<p>They were gaining, not losing, from taking the risk.</p>
<p>And there was no reason, no sane reason at all, for Harry to go
with them.</p>
<p>A calm came over Harry as he thought it, the cold and darkness
that had been wavering around the fringes of his mind retreated.
Yes, that was it, that was the creative outside-the-box route, that
was the hidden third alternative. The falseness of the dilemma was
obvious in retrospect. If Harry turned himself in, he
<em>didn't</em> have to turn in Bellatrix and Professor Quirrell.
If Bellatrix and Professor Quirrell took a dangerous escape route,
Harry <em>didn't</em> need to go with them.</p>
<p>Harry didn't even need to face the embarrassment of admitting
he'd been tricked, if he ordered Bellatrix to remove the memory.
Everyone would just assume he'd been kidnapped, including Harry
himself. Admittedly, there was no plausible reason why the Dark
Lord would ever ask Bellatrix to do that; but Harry could simply
smile and tell Bellatrix she wasn't allowed to know, and that would
be that...</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Her Auror team had gotten around three-quarters of the way down
Azkaban, as had the other two teams on the other two spirals.
Amelia was feeling tenser already, though she was betting on the
criminals hiding on the second-to-lowest floor, part of her wished
Dumbledore had thought to check that specific floor more carefully
and part of her was glad he hadn't.</p>
<p>And then there was a distant sound, like a tiny 'tink' noise
coming from far away. Like a very loud sound coming from the
second-to-lowest floor, say.</p>
<p>Amelia looked at Dumbledore before she realized, before she
managed to stop herself.</p>
<p>The old wizard shrugged, gave her a small smile, said, "Since
you asked it, Amelia," and went off yet again.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"<em>Finite Incantatem,"</em> Harry said to the oil coating the
giant chunk of metal on the floor. He hardly heard himself speak,
his ears were still ringing from the gigantic thud of the solid
metal sliding out of the wall and falling. (He should have put up a
Quieting Charm, in retrospect, though that wouldn't have stopped
the noise from spreading through the solid metal floor.) And then
Harry said it again, "<em>Finite Incantatem</em>" to the oil
coating the two-meter hole in the wall, spreading the effect wide;
it was his own magic Harry was canceling, which made the spell
almost effortless. Harry was feeling a bit tired now, but that was
the last use of magic he would need. He hadn't even <em>needed</em>
to do it, really, but Harry didn't want to leave Transfigured
liquid lying around, and he didn't want to betray the secret of
partial Transfiguration either.</p>
<p>It seemed very... <em>inviting,</em> that two-meter hole leading
to freedom.</p>
<p>The light from outside coming in... wasn't exactly the Sun
shining on his face, but it was brighter than anything of Azkaban's
interior.</p>
<p>Harry <em>was</em> tempted to just go with, just hop on the
broomstick with Bellatrix and the snake. Chances were that they
<em>would</em> get out safely. And if they <em>did</em> get out
safely, and Harry came with, then he and Professor Quirrell could
go back in time and look perfectly innocent, everything could go
back to normal.</p>
<p>If Harry stayed behind and turned himself in... then even if
everyone assumed Harry had been a hostage, assumed Harry had lied
to Professor McGonagall's Patronus at wandpoint... even if Harry
himself got off lightly, well...</p>
<p>It wasn't likely that the Defense Professor would go on teaching
at Hogwarts.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell would have reached the predestined end of his
career, in February of the school year.</p>
<p>And yes, Professor McGonagall would kill Harry, and yes, it
would be slow and painful.</p>
<p>But staying behind was the sensible, safe, <em>sane</em> thing
to do, and Harry was feeling more relaxed than regretful.</p>
<p>Harry turned to Bellatrix; he opened his mouth to instruct her a
final time -</p>
<p>And there was a hiss, a weak hiss, a hiss that sounded slow and
confused, and the hiss said,</p>
<p><em>"What wass... that noisse?</em> "</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Through the corridor the old wizard strode. He came to a metal
door and opened it, already knowing from memory that the cells
within were empty.</p>
<p>Seven mighty and discerning incantations the wizard spoke then,
before he moved on; it would be little enough exertion in total,
with so few cells left to check.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"<em>Teacher,</em>" Harry hissed. So many emotions bubbling up
in him, all at once. He knew, though he could not see, that the
green snake around Bellatrix's shoulders, was slowly lifting its
head to look around. "<em>Are you... all right, teacher?</em> "</p>
<p>"<em>Teacher?</em> " came the weak, confused hiss. "<em>Where
iss thiss?</em></p>
<p>"<em>Prisson,</em>" Harry hissed, "<em>the prisson with
life-eaterss, we were to resscue a woman, you and I. You tried to
sslay the protector man, I blocked your killing cursse, there was a
ressonance between uss... you fell unconssciouss, I had to defeat
the protector man mysself... my guardian Charm wass disspelled, the
life-eaterss could tell the protectorss that the woman had

without guardian Charm, sscare off life-eaterss without guardian

finally, cut hole in thick metal wall of prisson even though I am
only firsst-year sstudent. No time to explain, you musst go now. If
we never meet again, teacher, then I was glad to know you for a
time, even though you are probably evil. It iss good to have the
chance to ssay thiss much: Goodbye.</em>"</p>
<p>And Harry took the broomstick and presented it to Bellatrix,
saying simply, "Get on."</p>
<p>He had decided to keep the memories. For one thing, they were
important. For another, he and the Defense Professor had started
planning this a week ago, and Harry wasn't about to obliterate the
whole last week, <em>or</em> explain to Bellatrix exactly what
needed to be Obliviated. Harry could probably fool Veritaserum, and
if Dumbledore insisted that Harry drop his Occlumency shields for a
deeper examination... well, Harry had acted heroically
throughout.</p>
<p>"<em>Sstop!</em> " said the snake. Its voice was stronger now.
"<em>Sstop, sstop, sstop! What do you mean, goodbye?</em> "</p>
<p>"<em>Esscape plan iss rissky,</em>" said Harry. "<em>My life iss
not at sstake, only yourss and herss. Sso I am sstaying, turning
mysself in -</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>No!</em> " said the snake. The hiss was forceful.
"<em>Musst not! Not permitted!</em> "</p>
<p>Bellatrix mounted the broomstick; Harry could sense (but never
see) her head turning to look at him, she said no word. Awaiting
him, perhaps, or merely awaiting his orders.</p>
<p>"<em>No longer trusst you,</em>" Harry said simply. "<em>Not
ssince you tried to sslay the protector man.</em>"</p>
<p>And the snake hissed, "<em>I did not sseek to sslay the
protector man! Are you fool, boy? Sslaying him would not make
ssensse, evil or no!</em> "</p>
<p>The Earth ceased to turn on its axis, paused in its orbit around
the Sun.</p>
<p>The snake's hiss was now more furious than anything Harry had
ever heard from the human Professor Quirrell. "<em>Sslay him? Had I
ssought to sslay him he would have been dead within ssecondss, fool
boy, he wass no match for me! I ssought to ssubdue, to dominate,
force him to drop sshieldss upon hiss mind, needed to read him, to
know who awaited hiss reply, learn detailss for memory sspell
-"</em></p>
<p>"<em>You casst killing cursse!</em> "</p>
<p>"<em>Knew he would dodge!</em> "</p>
<p>"<em>Wass hiss life worth sso little? What if he did not
dodge?</em> "</p>
<p>"<em>Would have pusshed him out of the way with own magic, fool
boy!</em> "</p>
<p>Again the pause in the planet's spin. Harry hadn't thought of
that.</p>
<p>"<em>Witlesss dunce of a plotter,</em>" hissed the snake, so
angrily that the hisses seemed to overlap and slither over each
other's tails, "<em>clever imbecile, cunning idiot, fool of an
untrained Sslytherin, your missplaced misstrust hass ruined
-"</em></p>
<p>"<em>Thiss iss not a fair time to argue,</em>" Harry observed
mildly. The surge of relief trying to flood through him was
canceled by the increased tension. "<em>Ssince I cannot get angry
at you properly, without opening mysself to life-eaterss. Musst
russh, ssomeone may have heard noisse -"</em></p>
<p>"<em>Explain esscape plan,</em>" the snake said imperiously.
"<em>Sswiftly!</em> "</p>
<p>Harry explained. Parseltongue didn't have words for the Muggle
technology, but Harry described the function and Professor Quirrell
seemed to understand.</p>
<p>There were a few short hisses, the snakish equivalent of a bark
of surprised laughter, and then, snapped commands. "<em>Tell woman
to look away, casst sspell of ssilence, sset guardian Charm outside
door. Will transsform mysself, make few sswift improvementss to
your invention, give woman emergency potion sso sshe can sshield
uss, transsform back before you disspell Charm. Plan will be
ssafer, then.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>And am I to believe,</em>" Harry hissed, <em>"that healer
for woman truly awaitss uss?</em> "</p>
<p>"<em>Usse ssensse, boy! Ssupposse I am evil. To end usse of you
here iss obvioussly not what I planned. Misssion iss target of

meant to be unnoticed, hid when left eating-place. Obvioussly you
will ssee persson pretending to be healer on arrival! Go back to
eating-place afterward, original plan carriess on
undissturbed!</em> "</p>
<p>Harry stared at the invisible snake.</p>
<p>On the one hand, saying it like that made Harry feel rather
dumb.</p>
<p>And on the other hand, it wasn't exactly reassuring.</p>
<p>"<em>Sso,</em>" Harry hissed, "<em>what iss your plan for me,
precissely?</em> "</p>
<p>"<em>You ssaid no time,</em>" came the snake's hiss, "<em>but
plan iss for you to rule country, obvioussly, even your young noble

<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The old wizard reached out toward another metal door, from
behind which came a endless dead mutter, "I'm not serious, I'm not
serious, I'm not serious..." The red-golden phoenix on his shoulder
was already screaming urgently, and the old wizard was already
wincing, when -</p>
<p>Another cry pierced the corridor, phoenix-like but not the true
phoenix's call.</p>
<p>The wizard's head turned, looked at the blazing silver creature
on his other shoulder, even as ephemeral and substanceless talons
launched the spell-entity into the air.</p>
<p>The false phoenix flew down the corridor.</p>
<p>The old wizard raced off after, legs churning like a spry young
man of sixty.</p>
<p>The true phoenix screamed once, twice, and a third time,
hovering before the metal door; and then, when it became clear that
its master would not return for all its calling, flew reluctantly
after.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Professor Quirrell had assumed his true form, this time -
Polyjuice only lasted for an hour without redosing - and though the
Defense Professor was pale, leaning against the metal bars of the
nearest cell, his magic was strong enough to seize his wand without
a word, even as Bellatrix doffed the Cloak and placed it obediently
in Harry's waiting hand. The sense of doom was building once more,
though not in full force, as the Defense Professor's power
returned, the fringes of its vast force clashing with Harry's
slight childish aura.</p>
<p>Harry said aloud the description of his Muggle device, naming it
to the observing wizard, and then a Finite from Harry turned all
his hard work back into an ice cube. Professor Quirrell could not
cast spells on something Harry had Transfigured, for that would be
an interaction, however slight, between their magics, but -</p>
<p>Three seconds after, Professor Quirrell was holding his own
Transfigured version of the Muggle device. A single barked word and
a sweep of his wand, and the residue of glue was gone from the
magical item; three more incantations later, the magical and
technological were fused together as though into a single thing,
and Charms of Unbreakability and flawless function had been cast
upon the Muggle device.</p>
<p>(Harry felt a lot better about doing this under adult
supervision.)</p>
<p>A potion was thrown to Bellatrix, and Professor Quirrell and
Harry both commanded, "Drink," as though speaking in the same
voice. The emaciated woman had already been lifting it to her lips,
without waiting; for it was evident to anyone that this snake
Animagus was a servant of the Dark Lord, and a powerful and trusted
one.</p>
<p>Harry finished pulling the hood of the Cloak of Invisibility
over his head.</p>
<p>A brief and terrible magic lashed out from the Defense
Professor's wand, scouring the hole in the wall, scarring the huge
chunk of metal that lay in the room's midst; as Harry had
requested, saying that the method he'd used might identify him.</p>
<p>"Left-hand glove," Harry said to his pouch, and drew it forth,
and put it on.</p>
<p>A gesture from the Defense Professor made a harness appear upon
Bellatrix's shoulders, and another, smaller cloth device upon her
hand, and something like handcuffs on her wrists, even as the woman
finished drinking the potion.</p>
<p>A strange, unhealthy color seemed to come over Bellatrix's pale
face, she straightened, her sunken eyes seemed brighter and far
more dangerous...</p>
<p>...small wisps of steam were coming out of her ears...</p>
<p>(Harry decided not to think about that part.)</p>
<p>...and Bellatrix Black laughed, then, sudden mad laughter that
rang much too loudly amid the small prison cells of Azkaban.</p>
<p>(Very soon, the Defense Professor had said, Bellatrix would fall
unconscious and stay that way for quite awhile, the price of the
potion she had taken; but for just a few moments she would regain
perhaps a twentieth part of the power she had once wielded.)</p>
<p>The Defense Professor threw his wand toward Bellatrix, and an
instant later blurred into a green snake.</p>
<p>An instant after <em>that</em> the Dementors' fear returned to
the room.</p>
<p>Bellatrix flinched only slightly, caught the wand, and gestured
without a word; the snake flew up and was inserted into the harness
on her back.</p>
<p>Harry said "Up!" to the broomstick.</p>
<p>Bellatrix attached the wand to the holster on her hand.</p>
<p>Harry leaped onto the two-person broomstick in the lead
position.</p>
<p>Bellatrix followed behind him, she took the cufflike devices on
her wrists and chained her hands to the grips of the broomstick,
even as Harry's right hand shoved his wand into his pouch.</p>
<p>And the three shot forward through the hole in the wall -</p>
<p>- emerging into the open air, directly above the Dementors' pit,
in the interior of the vast triangular prism that was Azkaban, the
blue sky now clearly visible above them, shining down its
daylight.</p>
<p>Harry angled the broomstick and began accelerating, upward and
toward the center of the triangular space. His left hand, gloved to
prevent direct contact between his skin and something which
Professor Quirrell had Transfigured, held the switch of the control
on the Muggle device.</p>
<p>Far above them, distant shouts rang out.</p>
<p><em>All right, you primitive screwheads!</em></p>
<p>Aurors on fast racing broomsticks angled out of the sky, diving
straight down toward them, faint sparks of light already blazing
downward as the first shots were fired.</p>
<p><em>Listen up!<br></em></p>
<p>"Protego Maximus!" shouted Bellatrix in a mighty, cracked voice,
followed by a cackling laugh as a shimmering blue field surrounded
them.</p>
<p><em>You see this?</em></p>
<p>From the decaying pit in the center of Azkaban, over a hundred
Dementors rose into the air, appearing to some as a great mass of
corpses, a flying graveyard; appearing to another as a conglomerate
of absences that seemed to form one vast rip in the world as they
slid upward.</p>
<p><em>This...</em></p>
<p>The voice of an ancient and powerful wizard bellowed a terrible
incantation, and a great blast of white-golden fire shot out of the
hole in Azkaban's wall, shapeless for only a moment before it began
to form wings.</p>
<p><em>Is...</em></p>
<p>And the Aurors activated the Anti-Anti-Gravity Jinx that had
been built into the wards of Azkaban, disabling all flying spells
whose enchantment had not been cast with the recently changed
passphrase.</p>
<p>The lift on Harry's broom switched off.</p>
<p>Gravity, on the other hand, stayed on.</p>
<p>Their broom's upward rise slowed, started to decelerate, began
the process of turning into a fall.</p>
<p><em>My...</em></p>
<p>But the enchantments that kept the broom pointed in a direction
and allowed steering, the enchantments that kept the riders
attached and somewhat protected them from acceleration,
<em>those</em> enchantments were still functioning.</p>
<p><em>BROOMSTICK!</em></p>
<p>Harry hit the ignition switch on the General Technics made,
model <em>Berserker PFRC</em>, N-class, ammonium perchlorate
composite propellant, solid-fuel rocket that had been mated to his
Nimbus X200 two-person broomstick.</p>
<p>And there was noise.</p>
</div>
<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 55: The Stanford Prison Experiment,
Pt 5<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>In a scarred and ruined corridor, lit by dim gas lights, a boy
slowly crept forward, one hand stretched out, toward the unmoving
snake that was the body of his teacher.</p>
<p>Harry was only a meter away from the snake's body when he first
felt it, tickling at the edge of his perception.</p>
<p>Ever so weakly, a sense of doom...</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell <em>was</em> alive, then.</p>
<p>The thought engendered no feeling of joy, only a sort of empty
despair.</p>
<p>Harry would still be caught soon, and no matter how he tried to
explain, it still wouldn't look good. No one would trust him again,
they would think he was the next Dark Lord, they wouldn't help him
when it came time to fight Lord Voldemort, Hermione would give up
on him, probably even Dumbledore would look for another hero...</p>
<p>...maybe they'd just send him home to his parents.</p>
<p>He had failed.</p>
<p>Harry looked at the crumpled body of the police officer he'd
stunned, the already-drying blood from the minor cuts and slashes,
the burned places on the intricately embroidered red robes.</p>
<p>He'd been stupid. He <em>shouldn't</em> have stunned the police
officer, should have just <em>stayed</em> with his original story
about being kidnapped by Professor Quirrell...</p>
<p><em>It might not be too late,</em> whispered a voice inside him.
<em>You might still be able to fix your mistake. The Auror saw you,
he remembers that you stunned him... but if he were dead, if
Professor Quirrell were dead, if Bellatrix were dead, there would
be no one to contradict your story.</em></p>
<p>Slowly, Harry's hand started to rise, pointing his wand at the
police officer and -</p>
<p>Harry's hand halted.</p>
<p>He had a distant sense he was behaving uncharacteristically of
himself, somehow. Like there was something he'd forgotten,
something important, but he was having trouble remembering what it
was, exactly.</p>
<p>Oh. That was right. He was someone who believed in the value of
human life.</p>
<p>A sense of puzzlement accompanied the thought, he couldn't quite
remember <em>why</em> other people's lives had seemed
valuable...</p>
<p><em>All right,</em> said the logical part of him, w<em>hy has my
mind changed between then and now?</em></p>
<p>Because he was in Azkaban...</p>
<p>And he'd forgotten to recast the Patronus Charm...</p>
<p>Doing anything at all, somehow, seemed like a tremendous effort,
like the thought of action itself was a weight too heavy to lift;
but it did seem like a good idea to recast the Patronus Charm, for
he was still able to be afraid of Dementors. And though he couldn't
remember what it was like to be happy, he knew that this wasn't
it.</p>
<p>Harry's hand rose to hold his wand level before him, his fingers
took the starting positions.</p>
<p>And then Harry paused.</p>
<p>He couldn't... quite remember... what he'd used as his happy
thought.</p>
<p>That was odd, it had been something very important, he really
ought to be able to remember it... something to do with death? But
that wasn't happy...</p>
<p>His body was shivering, Azkaban hadn't seemed so cold before,
and it seemed to be getting colder even as he thought. It was too
late for him, he'd already sunk too far, he'd never be able to cast
the Patronus Charm now -</p>
<p><em>That may be the Dementation talking rather than an accurate
estimate,</em> observed the logical part of himself, habits that
had been encoded into sheer reflex, requiring no energy to
activate. <em>Think of the Dementors' fear as a cognitive bias, and
try to overcome it the way you would overcome any other cognitive
bias. Your hopeless feelings may not indicate that the situation is
actually hopeless. It may only indicate that you are in the
presence of Dementors. All negative emotions and pessimistic
estimates must now be considered suspect, fallacious until proven
valid.</em></p>
<p>(If you'd been watching the boy as he thought, you would have
seen a distant, abstract, puzzled frown move across his face, below
the glasses and the lightning-bolt scar. His hand stayed in the
starting position for the Patronus Charm, and did not move.)</p>
<p><em>The presence of Dementors interferes with the part of you
that processes happiness. If you cannot retrieve your happy thought
by mnemonic association on the key of happiness, perhaps you can
get at the memory some other way instead. When was the last time
you talked to someone about the Patronus Charm?</em></p>
<p>Harry couldn't seem to remember that either.</p>
<p>A crushing wave of despair swept over him, and was dismissed by
the logical part of himself as untrustworthy, external, not-Harry,
the dull weight still pressed him down but his mind went on
thinking, it didn't take much effort to think...</p>
<p><em>When was the last time you talked to someone about
Dementors?</em></p>
<p>Professor Quirrell had said that he was already able to feel the
presence of Dementors, and Harry had said to Professor Quirrell...
he'd told Professor Quirrell...</p>
<p>...to hold to the memory of the stars, of falling bodilessly
through space, like an Occlumency barrier across his entire
mind.</p>
<p>His second Defense class of the year, on Friday, that was when
Professor Quirrell had shown him the stars, and again on
Christmas.</p>
<p>It didn't take much effort to remember them, the searing points
of white against perfect blackness.</p>
<p>Harry remembered the great cloudy wash of the Milky Way.</p>
<p>Harry remembered the peace.</p>
<p>Some of the coldness at the fringes of his limbs seemed to
retreat.</p>
<p>There were words he had spoken out loud on the day he'd first
cast the Patronus Charm, his mind could remember the sounds and the
speech even as the feelings seemed distant...</p>
<p>...<em>I thought of my absolute rejection of death as the
natural order.</em></p>
<p>You cast the True Patronus Charm by thinking about the value of
human life.</p>
<p><em>...But there are other lives that are still alive to be
fought for. Your life, and my life, and Hermione Granger's life,
all the lives of Earth, and all the lives beyond, to be defended
and protected.</em></p>
<p>Then the idea of killing everyone... that hadn't been his true
self, that had been the Dementation talking...</p>
<p>Despair was the Dementors' influence.</p>
<p><em>Where there's life, there's hope. The Auror is still alive.
Professor Quirrell is still alive. Bellatrix is still alive. I'm
still alive. No one's actually died yet...</em></p>
<p>Harry could picture the Earth, now, in the midst of the
starfield, the blue-white orb.</p>
<p><em>...and I won't let them!</em></p>
<p>"Expecto Patronum!"</p>
<p>The words came out a little halting, and when the human shape
burst back into existence it was dim at first, moonlight instead of
sunlight, white instead of silver.</p>
<p>But it strengthened, slowly, as Harry breathed in deliberate
rhythm, recovering. Letting the light drive back the darkness from
his mind. Remembering the things that he had almost forgotten, and
channeling them back into the Patronus Charm.</p>
<p>Even when the light blazed full and silver once more,
illuminating the corridor more brightly than the gas lamps,
banishing fully the cold, Harry's limbs still shook. That had been
too close.</p>
<p>Harry took a deep breath. All right. It was time to reconsider
the situation now that his thoughts were no longer being
artificially darkened by Dementors.</p>
<p>Harry reviewed the situation.</p>
<p>...still looked pretty hopeless, actually.</p>
<p>It wasn't the crushing despair of before, but Harry still felt
wobbly, to put it mildly. He didn't dare go dark and it was his
dark side that had the ability to take this level of problem in
stride. It was his dark side that would have laughed scornfully at
the very concept of giving up just because he'd lost Professor
Quirrell and was marooned in the depths of Azkaban and had been
seen by a police officer. The ordinary Harry was not able to take
that sort of thing in stride.</p>
<p>But there wasn't any option except to keep moving forward
anyway. You couldn't get any <em>more</em> pointless than giving up
before you'd actually lost.</p>
<p>Harry looked around.</p>
<p>Dim gas lights lit a corridor of grey metal, whose sides and
floor and ceiling were slashed in places, gouged and melted,
telling anyone who cared to look that there had been battle
here.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell could have repaired it easily enough, if
he'd...</p>
<p>The sense of betrayal struck Harry with full force, then.</p>
<p><em>Why... why did he... why...</em></p>
<p><em>Because he's evil,</em> said Gryffindor and Hufflepuff,
quietly and sadly. <em>We told you so.</em></p>
<p><em>No!</em> thought Harry desperately. <em>No, it doesn't make
sense, we were going to commit the perfect crime, the Auror could
have been Obliviated, the corridor repaired, it wasn't too late but
it would have BEEN too late if he'd died!</em></p>
<p><em>But Professor Quirrell was never really planning to commit
the perfect crime,</em> said the grim voice of Slytherin.
<em>He</em> wanted <em>the crime to be noticed. He wanted everyone
to know that someone had killed an Auror and broken Bellatrix Black
out of Azkaban. He would have prepared some kind of evidence, some
proof he could reveal of your involvement, to use as blackmail
against you; and you would have been bound to him forever.</em></p>
<p>Harry's Patronus almost went out, then.</p>
<p><em>No...</em> Harry thought.</p>
<p><em>Yes,</em> said the other three parts of him sadly.</p>
<p><em>No. It still doesn't make sense. Professor Quirrell had to
know I would turn against him the instant I saw him kill an Auror.
That I might very well go ahead and confess to Dumbledore, hoping
to plead the true fact that I was tricked. And... in terms of
blackmail, does his killing an Auror against my will, really add
all</em> that <em>much to breaking Bellatrix out of Azkaban with my
willing help? It would have been more cunning to keep the evidence
of my involvement with the basic crime, but still pretend to be my
ally for as long as he could, saving the blackmail to use only if
it became necessary...</em></p>
<p><em>Rationalization,</em> said Slytherin. <em>So why</em> did
<em>Professor Quirrell do it, then?</em></p>
<p>And Harry thought with a tinge of desperation - knowing, even as
he thought it, that he was motivated in part by a desire to reject
reality, and that wasn't how the technique was meant to be wielded
- <em>I notice that I am confused.</em></p>
<p>There was internal silence. None of the parts of himself seemed
to have anything to add to that.</p>
<p>And Harry continued to take stock of the moderately
hopeless-looking situation.</p>
<p>Did Harry need to re-evaluate the probability that Bellatrix was
evil?</p>
<p>...not in any mission-relevant sense. It was a <em>given</em>
that Bellatrix was currently evil. Whether she was an innocent
who'd been made that way by torture and Legilimency and unspeakable
rituals, or whether she'd chosen it of her own will, didn't have
much bearing on the current situation. The key fact was that while
Bellatrix thought Harry was the Dark Lord, she would obey him.</p>
<p>That was one resource, then. But Bellatrix was starved and
nine-tenths dead...</p>
<p><em>'Oh, I feel a little better now, how strange...'</em></p>
<p>Bellatrix had said that, in her shattered voice, after Harry's
Patronus had blazed out of control.</p>
<p>Harry thought, and he couldn't have quite said <em>why</em> he
thought this, it might have just been his own mind making things
up, but... it seemed likely that what the Dementors had taken from
you long ago was lost forever. But what the Dementors had taken
from you <em>recently,</em> the True Patronus Charm might give
back. Like the difference between emptying a cup, and the unused
cup fading away. Bellatrix, then, might have got back what she'd
lost in just the last week or so. Not any happy memories, those
would have been eaten years ago. But whatever strength and magic
had been drained from her in just the last week, she might have
regained. Like the equivalent of getting a week of rest, a week to
build up her magic again...</p>
<p>Harry looked at Professor Quirrell's snake form.</p>
<p>...maybe enough for an <em>Innervate.</em></p>
<p>If awakening Professor Quirrell <em>was</em>, in fact, a smart
thing to do.</p>
<p>Some of the despair came back to Harry, then. He couldn't trust
Professor Quirrell, couldn't trust that reviving him would be wise,
not after what had just happened.</p>
<p><em>Steady,</em> Harry thought to himself, and looked at the
crumpled form of the Auror.</p>
<p>Bellatrix might <em>also</em> be able to manage a Memory
Charm.</p>
<p>That could be step one, anyway. It wasn't exactly getting
everyone safely out of Azkaban, and the Aurors <em>would</em> know
afterward that something strange had happened, they might suspect
Bellatrix's body and perform an autopsy. But it was a step.</p>
<p>...and <em>would</em> it be all that hard to get out of Azkaban?
If they could get to the top of Azkaban quickly enough, before the
Auror was supposed to report back in, before anyone noticed him
missing, then they could just fly out through the hole Professor
Quirrell had made, and get far enough away from Azkaban to activate
the portkey Harry already had in his possession. (Both Professor
Quirrell and Harry had portkeys, and both were powerful enough to
transport two humans, plus or minus a snake. As with their
doubly-concealed departure from Mary's Room, Professor Quirrell had
put enough safety margin in his plans to impress even Harry.)</p>
<p>Bellatrix could carry Professor Quirrell's snake form, which
Harry dared not touch or levitate.</p>
<p>Harry turned and strode quickly toward where Bellatrix was
waiting on the stairs. He could feel his spirits reviving a little.
It <em>was</em> starting to look like a good plan, and there was no
time to waste in going about it.</p>
<p>What to do with Professor Quirrell, or for that matter
Bellatrix, after the portkey took them to where they were supposed
to hand Bellatrix over to the psychiatric healer... well, Harry
could work that out along the way. Harry would probably have to
bamboozle the healer into doing something - which was going to take
one hell of a bamboozling, and Harry wasn't even sure what he
<em>wanted</em> done - but he and Bellatrix had to get moving
<em>now.</em></p>
<p>The main problem Harry saw, as he quickly ran the whole process
forward in his imagination, would come when they reached the roof.
Professor Quirrell had been supposed to sneak around invisibly and
Confund the monitors that would notice visitors in the aerial
surroundings of Azkaban, causing them to see a repeating loop of
scenery for a few minutes. Professor Quirrell had said that he
couldn't Disillusion Harry's Patronus; and if they switched
<em>off</em> the Patronus, the Dementors would notice Bellatrix was
missing, and alert the Aurors...</p>
<p>Harry's train of thought stumbled.</p>
<p>There were times when 'Aw, crap' just didn't seem to cover
it.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Li's hands were sure despite the adrenaline, as he unlocked the
bars on the Vanishing Cabinet that linked Azkaban to a well-guarded
room in the interior of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.
(A one-way Vanishing Cabinet, of course. The wards permitted a few
fast ways <em>into</em> Azkaban, all of them highly restricted, and
<em>no</em> fast ways out.)</p>
<p>Li stepped well back, pointed his wand at the Cabinet, spoke the
incantation "<em>Harmonia Nectere Passus</em>", and not a second
later -</p>
<p>The door of the Cabinet burst open with a bang, and into the
room strode a heavy-set, square-jawed witch with greyed hair
cropped close around her head. She wore no rank signs as she wore
no jewelry or other ornamentation, it was only an ordinary Auror's
robes that she deemed fit to grace herself: Director Amelia Bones,
head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and said to be
the only witch in the DMLE who could take Mad-Eye Moody in a fair
fight (not that either of those two were the sort to fight fairly).
Li had heard rumors that Amelia could Apparate within the bounds of
the DMLE, and this was the sort of thing that gave rise to rumors
like that, he'd called in the alarm not fifty seconds ago.</p>
<p>"Get into the air, now!" Amelia barked over her shoulder at the
female Auror trio following behind her with police broomsticks,
they must have all been crushed in there, waiting for Li to
activate the Cabinet. "I want more aerial coverage on this place!
And make sure you keep up your anti-Disillusionment Charms!" Then
her head turned toward him. "Report, Auror Li! Do we know how they
got in yet?"</p>
<p>Another Auror trio holding broomsticks materialized in the
Vanishing Cabinet and strode out after them even as Li began
talking.</p>
<p>They were followed by a trio of Hit Wizards in full battle
gear.</p>
<p>Then another trio of Hit Wizards.</p>
<p>Then another broomstick team.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The emaciated form that was Bellatrix Black was resting
motionless on the stairs when Harry got there, eyes closed, and
when Harry asked in a cold, high whisper whether she was awake, he
got no response.</p>
<p>A brief twitch of panic was countered by the thought that
Professor Quirrell had knocked her out to prevent her from hearing
the Dark Lord's cringing servant suddenly turn into a hardened
criminal and then an expert battlemage. Which was good, because she
wouldn't have heard Harry's voice saying 'Expecto Patronum'.</p>
<p>Harry drew back the hood of the Cloak, pointed his wand at
Bellatrix, and whispered as gently as he could,
"<em>Innervate.</em>"</p>
<p>From the way Bellatrix's body jerked a little, Harry didn't
think he'd managed to get it quite gentle enough.</p>
<p>The sunken dark eyes opened.</p>
<p>"Bella dear," Harry said in his cold, high voice, "I am afraid
we've run into a bit of a problem. Have you recovered enough to do
small magics?"</p>
<p>There was a pause, and then Bellatrix's pale head nodded.</p>
<p>"Very good," Harry said dryly. "I won't ask you to walk unaided,
Bella dear, but I am afraid you must walk." He pointed his wand at
her. "<em>Wingardium Leviosa.</em>"</p>
<p>Harry kept the flow of force down to something he could sustain
for a while, and it was still probably lifting two-thirds of her
current body weight. She was... thin.</p>
<p>Slowly, as though for the first time in years, Bellatrix Black
pushed herself to her feet.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Amelia strode into the duty room, Auror Li and his silver badger
following behind her. She'd spun her Time-Turner the moment she'd
heard the alarm, and then spent a tense hour preparing her forces
for entry. You couldn't <em>loop</em> time within Azkaban itself,
Azkaban's future couldn't interact with its past, so she hadn't
been able to arrive before the DMLE had gotten the message, but she
should have arrived in time...</p>
<p>Her eyes went straight to the corpse, uncloaked and looking very
dead, floating beyond the viewing window.</p>
<p>"Where is Bellatrix Black?" Amelia demanded, showing no fear
before the creature of fear.</p>
<p>Even her own blood froze for an instant, as the corpse parted
its lips, and gurgled, "<em>Do not know.</em>"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry watched, now fully invisible once more, as Bellatrix
slowly leaned down, took Professor Quirrell's wand (which Harry
dared not touch), and slowly straightened again.</p>
<p>Then Bellatrix pointed the wand at the snake, and said, her
voice precise though it was still a whisper,
"<em>Innervate.</em>"</p>
<p>The snake did not stir.</p>
<p>"Shall I try again, my Lord?" she whispered.</p>
<p>"No," Harry said. He swallowed the sick feeling. Harry had
decided to say the hell with it and try to revive Professor
Quirrell after he'd realized that the Dementors had probably
alerted the Aurors by now. His high, cold voice went on,
unperturbed, "Do you think you are able to perform a Memory Charm,
dear Bella?"</p>
<p>Bellatrix paused, and then said, hesitantly, "I think so, my
Lord."</p>
<p>"Eliminate that Auror's last half-hour of memory," Harry
commanded. He'd thought a bit about whether he wanted to provide
any justification for that, what he would say if Bellatrix asked
why they weren't just killing him, in which case Harry would
explain that they were pretending to be a different power group and
then tell her to shut up -</p>
<p>But Bellatrix simply pointed her wand at the Auror, stood
silently for a time, and finally whispered,
"<em>Obliviate.</em>"</p>
<p>She swayed, then, but did not fall.</p>
<p>"Very good, my dear Bella," Harry said, and chuckled thinly.
"And I will ask you to carry that snake."</p>
<p>Again, the woman said nothing, demanded no explanations, didn't
ask why Harry or the apparently-invisible Patronus caster couldn't
do it. She only staggered to where the long snake lay, slowly bent
over, picked it up, draped it over her shoulder.</p>
<p>(A tiny little part of Harry observed that it was very
<em>relaxing</em> to have a minion that would just follow orders so
unquestioningly, and even got as far as thinking that he could
totally get used to having a minion like Bellatrix, before that
mind-fraction was screamed into silence by his mortally offended
remainder.)</p>
<p>"Follow," the boy commanded his minion, and began to walk.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>It was starting to get crowded in the duty room, almost too
crowded to breathe, though there was still space around Amelia
herself; if needing to breathe meant that you had to crowd Director
Bones, it was better not to breathe.</p>
<p>Amelia looked at where Ora was fiddling with Auror McCusker's
mirror. "Specialist Weinbach," she barked, causing the young witch
to start. "Any response from One-Hand's mirror?"</p>
<p>"None," Ora said nervously, "it's... I mean it has to be jammed,
not dead, carefully jammed because it didn't set off the alarms,
but the line is so blank the mirror might as well be broken..."</p>
<p>Amelia didn't let her expression change, though the part of her
that was already mourning One-Hand got a little sadder and a lot
more angry. Seven months, he'd had seven months left until his
retirement after a full century of service. She remembered him as
an eager young Auror, so very long ago, and his whole career he'd
served the DMLE with perfect loyalty, at least when it came to
anything really important...</p>
<p>Someone would <em>burn</em> for this.</p>
<p>The Dementor still hovered outside the window, casting its
useless shadow of dread over their operations; all the creature
could do was gurgle its lack of knowledge or fail to reply at all,
when asked questions like 'Did Bellatrix Black escape?' and 'Why
can't you find her?' and 'How is she being hidden?' Amelia was
starting to worry that the criminals were already gone, when -</p>
<p>"We found a hole in the roof over C spiral!" someone shouted
from the doorway. "Still open, ward circumventions still
active!"</p>
<p>Amelia's lips peeled back in a smile like a wolf opening its
jaws to eat.</p>
<p>Bellatrix Black was still in Azkaban.</p>
<p>And in Azkaban, Bellatrix Black would remain forever.</p>
<p>She took a stride toward the window, ignoring the Dementor now,
and looked up at the sky above, to check with her own eyes the
patrolling broomsticks. She couldn't see the whole sky from here,
but she saw ten brooms go past on a patrol pattern and that already
ought to be enough to catch anyone, though she fully meant to put
every broom she could in the air. Her Aurors were equipped with the
fastest racing broom currently on the market, the Nimbus 2000; no
unsuccessful chases for <em>her</em> people.</p>
<p>Amelia turned back from the window, and frowned. The room was
getting ridiculously crowded, and two thirds of these people didn't
<em>need</em> to be here, they just <em>wanted</em> to be close to
the center of the action. If there was one thing Amelia couldn't
tolerate, it was people who did what they wanted instead of what
was needed.</p>
<p>"All right, you lot!" Amelia bellowed at them. "Stop hanging
around here and start securing the top level of each spiral! That's
right," she said to the looks of surprise, "all three! They could
tunnel through a floor or a ceiling to go between them, in case you
hadn't worked that out! We're going down level by level until we
catch them! I'll take C spiral, Scrimgeour, you're on B..." She
paused, then, remembering that Mad-Eye had retired last year, who
could she... "Shacklebolt, you're on the A spiral, take with the
strongest other fighters! Check every set of cells you pass, look
under blankets, do the full set of detection Charms in every
corridor! Nobody leaves Azkaban until the criminals are caught,
nobody! And..." People looked at Amelia in surprise as her voice
trailed off.</p>
<p><em>The criminals had invented some way to prevent the Dementors
from finding Bellatrix Black.</em></p>
<p>That ought to have been <em>impossible.</em></p>
<p>It chilled her blood, contemplating that. It was like...</p>
<p>Amelia took a deep breath, and spoke once more, in a voice of
steel command. "And when you catch them, make bloody sure they're
the real criminals and not our own people forced to take Polyjuice.
Anyone behaves oddly, check them for the Imperius Curse. Keep each
other in sight at all times. Don't assume an Auror uniform is
friendly if you don't recognize the face." She turned to the
communications specialist. "Tell the broomsticks. If one of the
brooms peels off for no reason, <em>half</em> of them are to hunt
it down while the <em>rest</em> keep patrolling. And change the
harmonics on everything changeable, they may have stolen our keys."
Then back to the rest of the room. "No Auror is above suspicion
unless they have no family left to threaten."</p>
<p>She saw it, the cold looks that came over the older faces, saw
some of the younger Aurors flinch, and knew that they
understood.</p>
<p>But she said it out loud, just to be sure.</p>
<p>"We're fighting the old Wizarding War today, everyone. Just
because You-Know-Who is dead doesn't mean the Death Eaters have
forgotten his tricks. Now <em>go!</em> "</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry walked in silence through the gas-lit grey corridor,
invisible beside Bellatrix and the silver shape following them,
trying to think of a better plan.</p>
<p>At first, when he'd realized that the Aurors probably knew
already, and that moreover, Professor Quirrell wasn't waking
up...</p>
<p>His thoughts <em>had</em> frozen up there, for a second.</p>
<p>And then stayed frozen, even as he'd gotten himself and
Bellatrix heading downward, to buy as much time as possible; the
Aurors, Harry figured, would start at the top and move down level
by level. The Aurors could afford to move slowly and securely; they
knew their prey had no way out.</p>
<p>Harry hadn't been able to think of any way out.</p>
<p>Until Harry had said to himself, <em>well, if it was just a war
game, what would General Chaos do?</em></p>
<p>From which an answer had followed instantly.</p>
<p>And then Harry had thought, <em>but if it's</em> that <em>easy,
why hasn't anyone broken out of Azkaban before?</em></p>
<p>And after he'd realized the possible problem: <em>Fine, what
would General Chaos do about</em> that?</p>
<p>Whereupon General Chaos had come up with an amendment to his
first plan.</p>
<p>It was...</p>
<p>It was the most insanely <em>Gryffindor</em> thing Harry had
ever...</p>
<p>So now he was trying to think of a <em>better</em> plan, and not
having much luck.</p>
<p><em>Picky picky picky,</em> said Gryffindor. <em>Who was
complaining about not having</em> any <em>plan one minute earlier?
You should be glad we came up with anything at all, Mister
Now-We're-Doomed.</em></p>
<p>"My Lord," Bellatrix whispered haltingly, as she navigated the
next flight of stairs downward, "am I going back to my cell, my
Lord?"</p>
<p>Harry's brain was distracted, so it took him that long to
process the words, and then another moment to process the horror,
while Bellatrix continued speaking.</p>
<p>"I would... please, my Lord, I would very much rather die," her
voice said. And then, in a smaller voice, a whisper that was barely
there, "but I will go back if you ask it of me, my Lord..."</p>
<p>"We are not going back to your cell," hissed Harry's voice, on
automatic. Nothing of what he felt was allowed to reach his
face.</p>
<p><em>Um...</em> said Hufflepuff. <em>Did you seriously just
think, 'You ought to work for me,</em> I <em>would appreciate
you?'</em></p>
<p><em>A stone would respond to that kind of loyalty,</em> Harry
thought. <em>Even if I'm only getting it by mistake, I can't help
but -</em></p>
<p><em>She's the Dark Lord's loyal killer and torturer, and the
supposed reason she's loyal is because an innocent girl was broken
into pieces and used as raw material to make her,</em> said
Hufflepuff. <em>Did you forget?</em></p>
<p><em>If someone shows me that much loyalty, even by mistake,
there's a part of me that can't help but feel something. The Dark
Lord must have been...</em> evil <em>doesn't seem like a strong
enough word, he must have been</em> empty<em>... to not appreciate
her loyalty, artificial or not.</em></p>
<p>The better parts of Harry didn't have much to say to that.</p>
<p>And that was when Harry heard it.</p>
<p>It was faint, and it grew louder with every step they took
forward.</p>
<p>A woman's voice, distant, indistinct.</p>
<p>His ears, automatically, strained to make out the words.</p>
<p>"...please don't..."</p>
<p>"...didn't mean..."</p>
<p>"...don't die..."</p>
<p>Then his brain knew <em>who</em> he was hearing, and in almost
the same moment, figured out <em>what</em> he was hearing.</p>
<p>Because Professor Quirrell wasn't there to keep the silence any
more, and Azkaban was not, in fact, silent.</p>
<p>Faint the woman's voice, repeating:</p>
<p>"No, I didn't mean it, please don't die!"</p>
<p>"No, I didn't mean it, please don't die!"</p>
<p>It got louder with every step Harry took, he could hear the
emotion in the words now, the horror, the remorse, the desperation
of...</p>
<p>"No, I didn't mean it, please don't die!"</p>
<p>...the woman's worst memory, rehearsing over and over
again...</p>
<p>"No, I didn't mean it, please don't die!"</p>
<p>...the murder that had sent her to Azkaban...</p>
<p>"No, I didn't mean it, please don't die!"</p>
<p>...where she was sentenced by the Dementors to watch whoever
she'd killed, die and die and die in an infinite repeating loop.
Though she must have been put in Azkaban recently, from the amount
of life left in her voice.</p>
<p>The thought came to Harry, then, that Professor Quirrell had
passed those doors, heard those sounds, and given not the slightest
sign of disturbance; and Harry would have called it a positive
proof of evil, if Harry's own lips hadn't remained silent in the
presence of Bellatrix, his breathing regular, while something
inside him screamed and screamed and screamed.</p>
<p>The Patronus brightened, not out of control, but it brightened,
with every step Harry took forward.</p>
<p>It brightened further as Harry and Bellatrix descended the
stairs, she stumbled and Harry offered her his left arm thrust
outside the Cloak, braving the sense of doom from being that close
to the snake draped around her neck. There was a surprised look on
her face, but she accepted it, and said nothing.</p>
<p>It helped Harry, being able to help Bellatrix, but it wasn't
enough.</p>
<p>Not when he saw the huge metal door in the center of that
level's corridor.</p>
<p>Not when they came closer, and the woman's voice fell silent,
because there was a Patronus near her now, and she wasn't reliving
her worst memory any more.</p>
<p><em>Good,</em> said a voice inside him. <em>That was step
one.</em></p>
<p>Harry's steps carried him inevitably forward toward the metal
door.</p>
<p>And...</p>
<p><em>Now unlock the door -</em></p>
<p>...Harry kept walking...</p>
<p><em>What do you think you're doing? Go back and get her out of
there!</em></p>
<p>...kept walking...</p>
<p><em>Save her! What are you doing? She's hurting YOU HAVE TO SAVE
HER!</em></p>
<p>The portkey Harry was carrying could transport two humans, only
two, plus or minus a snake. If they'd had Professor Quirrell's
portkey too... but they <em>didn't</em>, Professor Quirrell's human
form was carrying that, there was no way to get it... Harry could
only save one person today, and there was only one person on the
lowest level of Azkaban, in the most desperate need...</p>
<p>"DON'T GO!" The voice came in a scream from behind the metal
door. "No, no, no, don't go, don't take it away, don't don't don't
-"</p>
<p>There was a light in the corridor and it grew brighter.</p>
<p>"Please," sobbed the woman's voice, "please, I can't remember my
children's names any more -"</p>
<p>"Sit down, Bella," Harry's voice said, somehow he kept his voice
in a cold whisper, "I must deal with this," the Hover Charm
diminishing and switching off even as Bella obediently sat down,
her skeletal form dark against the brightening air.</p>
<p><em>I'll die,</em> thought Harry.</p>
<p>The air went on brightening.</p>
<p>After all, it wasn't a <em>certainty</em> that Harry would
die.</p>
<p>It was just a probability of death, and weren't some things
worth a probability of dying?</p>
<p>The air went on brightening, the greater Patronus was beginning
to form around him, the brilliant human shape was becoming
indistinct within the burning air, as Harry's life went to feed the
fire.</p>
<p><em>If I wipe out the Dementors, then even if I live, they'll
know it was me, that I was the one who did this... I'll lose my
support, lose the war...</em></p>
<p><em>Yeah?</em> said the inner voice that was urging him on.
<em>After you destroy all the Dementors in Azkaban? I'd think
that'd tend to prove your credentials as a Light Lord, actually, so
SAVE HER SAVE HER YOU HAVE TO SAVE HER -</em></p>
<p>The humanoid shape could no longer be seen as a separate
entity.</p>
<p>The corridor couldn't be seen.</p>
<p>Harry's own body was invisible within the Cloak.</p>
<p>There was only a bodiless viewpoint within an infinite expanse
of silver light.</p>
<p>Harry could feel the life leaving him, fueling the spell; far
away, he could feel the shadows of Death begin to fray.</p>
<p><em>I meant to accomplish more with my life than this... I was
going to fight the Dark Lord, I was going to merge the wizarding
and Muggle worlds...</em></p>
<p>Lofty goals seemed very distant, very abstract, compared to one
woman begging him for help, it wasn't <em>certain</em> that Harry
would ever do anything more important than this one thing, this one
thing that he could do now and here.</p>
<p>And with what might have been his last breath, Harry
thought:</p>
<p><em>There are other Dementors, probably other Azkabans... if I'm
going to do this, I should do it when I'm closer to the central
pit, it will take less of my life that way, which increases the
probability that I'll survive to destroy other Dementors... even
assuming this is the optimal thing to do, if there's a right time
and place to do this, it isn't now and here, IT ISN'T NOW AND
HERE!</em></p>
<p><em>What?</em> said the other part of him indignantly, as it
searched for a counterargument that didn't exist -</p>
<p>Slowly the light died back down, as Harry concentrated on that
one indisputable fact, the one obvious truth that they weren't in
the optimal place, the time <em>couldn't</em> be
<em>now...</em></p>
<p>Slowly the light died back down.</p>
<p>Part of Harry's life flowed back into him.</p>
<p>Part had been lost as radiation.</p>
<p>But Harry had enough left to stay on his feet, and keep the
silver human shape bright; and when his wand arm raised and his
voice whispered "Wingardium Leviosa", the magic flowed obediently
out of him and helped Bellatrix to her feet. (For it wasn't his
magic he had expended, it had never been his magic that fueled the
Patronus Charm.)</p>
<p><em>I swear,</em> Harry thought, breathing as regularly as he
could in Bellatrix's presence, while tears streamed down his
invisible cheeks, <em>I swear upon my life and my magic and my art
as a rationalist, I swear by everything I hold sacred and all my
happy memories, I give my oath that someday I will end this place,
please, please may I be forgiven...</em></p>
<p>And the two of them walked on, as a murderess's voice screamed
and begged someone to come back and save her.</p>
<p>There should have been more time, there should have been a
ceremony, for Harry's sacrifice of that piece of himself, but
Bellatrix was beside him and so Harry just had to keep on walking
without a pause, saying nothing, breathing evenly.</p>
<p>So Harry walked on, leaving a piece of himself behind. It would
dwell in this place and time forever, he knew. Even after Harry
came back someday with a company of other True Patronus casters and
they destroyed all the Dementors here. Even if he melted the
triangular building and burned the island low enough that the sea
would wash over it, leaving no trace that such a place as this had
ever once existed. Even then he wouldn't get it back.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The flock of luminous creatures stopped staring downward, and
began patrolling the metal corridor as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>"Just like last time?" Director Bones snapped in the direction
of Auror Li, and the young Auror replied, "Yes, ma'am."</p>
<p>The Director fired off another query to see if the Dementors
could now find their target, and looked unsurprised to hear a
negative reply a few seconds later.</p>
<p>Emmeline Vance was feeling torn between her loyalties.</p>
<p>Emmeline wasn't a member of the Order of the Phoenix any more,
they had disbanded after the end of the last war. And during the
war, she'd known, they'd all known, that Director Crouch had
quietly approved of their off-the-books battle.</p>
<p>Director Bones wasn't Crouch.</p>
<p>But they were hunting Bellatrix Black now, who had been a Death
Eater, and who was certainly being rescued by Death Eaters. Their
Patronuses were behaving oddly - all the bright creatures stopping
and staring off downward, before they'd gone back to following
their masters. And the Dementors couldn't find their target.</p>
<p>It seemed to her that this would be an extremely good time to
consult Albus Dumbledore.</p>
<p>Should she just <em>suggest</em> to Director Bones that they
contact Dumbledore? But if Director Bones hadn't contacted him
already...</p>
<p>Emmeline wavered for a while, probably too long, and then
finally decided. <em>The hell with it,</em> she thought. <em>We're
all on the same side, we need to stick together whether Director
Bones likes it or not.</em></p>
<p>At a thought, her silver sparrow fluttered onto her
shoulder.</p>
<p>"Drop behind us to guard our rear," Emmeline murmured softly,
almost without moving her lips, "wait until no one is looking
directly at you, then go to Albus Dumbledore. If he is not already
by himself, wait until he is. And tell him this: Bellatrix Black is
breaking out of Azkaban, and the Dementors cannot find her."</p>

<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 60: The Stanford Prison Experiment,
Pt 10<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>"Wake."</p>
<p>Harry's eyes flew open as he came awake with a choking gasp, a
jerking start of his prone body. He couldn't remember any dreams,
maybe his brain had been too exhausted to dream, it seemed like
he'd only closed his eyes and then heard that word spoken a moment
after.</p>
<p>"You must awaken," said the voice of Quirinus Quirrell. "I gave
you as much time as I could, but it would be wise to reserve at
least one use of your Time-Turner. Soon we must go backward four
hours to Mary's Place, appearing in every way as though we have
done nothing interesting this day. I wished to speak to you before
then."</p>
<p>Harry slowly sat up in the midst of darkness. His body ached,
and not only in the places where it had laid on the hard concrete.
Images tumbled over each other in his memory, everything his
unconscious brain had been too tired to discharge into a proper
nightmare.</p>
<p>Twelve terrible voids floating down a metal corridor, tarnishing
the metal around them, light dimmed and temperature falling as the
emptiness tried to suck all life out of the world -</p>
<p>Chalk-white skin, stretched just above the bone that had
remained after fat and muscle faded -</p>
<p>A metal door -</p>
<p>A woman's voice -</p>
<p><em>No, I didn't mean it, please don't die -</em></p>
<p><em>I can't remember my children's names any more -</em></p>
<p><em>Don't go, don't take it away, don't don't don't -</em></p>
<p>"What was that place?" Harry said hoarsely, in a voice pushed
out of his throat like water forced through a too-thin pipe, in the
darkness it sounded almost as shattered as Bellatrix Black's voice
had been. "<em>What was that place? That wasn't a prison, that was
HELL!</em> "</p>
<p>"Hell?" said the calm voice of the Defense Professor. "You mean
the Christian punishment fantasy? I suppose there is a
similarity."</p>
<p>"How -" Harry's voice was blocking, there was something huge
lodged in his throat. "How - how could they -" <em>People</em> had
built that place, someone had <em>made</em> Azkaban, they'd made it
on <em>purpose,</em> they'd done it <em>deliberately,</em> that
woman, she'd had children, children she wouldn't remember, some
judge had <em>decided</em> for that to happen to her, someone had
needed to <em>drag</em> her into that cell and lock its door while
she screamed, someone fed her every day and walked away <em>without
letting her out</em> -</p>
<p>"<em>HOW COULD PEOPLE DO THAT?</em> "</p>
<p>"Why shouldn't they?" said the Defense Professor. A pale blue
light lit the warehouse, then, showing a high, cavernous concrete
ceiling, and a dusty concrete floor; and Professor Quirrell sitting
some distance away from Harry, leaning his back against a painted
wall; the pale blue light turned the walls to glacier surfaces, the
dust on the floor to speckled snow, and the man himself had become
an ice sculpture, shrouded in darkness where his black robes lay
over him. "What use are the prisoners of Azkaban to them?"</p>
<p>Harry's mouth opened in a croak. No words exited.</p>
<p>A faint smile twitched on the Defense Professor's lips. "You
know, Mr. Potter, if He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named had come to rule over
magical Britain, and built such a place as Azkaban, he would have
built it because he enjoyed seeing his enemies suffer. And if
instead he began to find their suffering distasteful, why, he would
order Azkaban torn down the next day. As for those who did make
Azkaban, and those who do not tear it down, while preaching lofty
sermons and imagining themselves <em>not</em> to be villains...
well, Mr. Potter, I think if I had my choice of taking tea with
them, or taking tea with You-Know-Who, I should find my
sensibilities less offended by the Dark Lord."</p>
<p>"I don't understand," Harry said, his voice was shaking, he'd
read about the classic experiment on the psychology of prisons, the
ordinary college students who had turned sadistic as soon as they
were assigned the role of prison guards; only now he realized that
the experiment hadn't examined the right question, the one most
important question, they hadn't looked at the key people, not the
prison guards but <em>everyone else,</em> "I really don't
understand, Professor Quirrell, how can people just stand by and
let this happen, <em>why</em> is the country of magical Britain
<em>doing this</em> -" Harry's voice stopped.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor's eyes appeared to be the same color as
always, in the pale blue light, for that light was the same color
as Quirinus Quirrell's irises, those never-thawing chips of ice.
"Welcome, Mr. Potter, to your first encounter with the realities of
politics. What do the wretched creatures in Azkaban have to offer
any faction? Who would benefit from aiding them? A politician who
openly sided with them would associate themselves with criminals,
with weakness, with distasteful things that people would rather not
think about. Alternatively, the politician could demonstrate their
might and cruelty by calling for longer sentences; to make a
display of strength requires a victim to crush beneath you, after
all. And the populace applauds, for it is their instinct to back
the winner." A coldly amused laugh. "You see, Mr. Potter, no one
ever quite believes that <em>they</em> will go to Azkaban, so they
see no harm in it for themselves. As for what they inflict on
others... I suppose you were once told that people care about that
sort of thing? It is a lie, Mr. Potter, people don't care in the
slightest, and if you had not led a vastly sheltered childhood you
would have noticed that long ago. Console yourself with this: those
now prisoner in Azkaban voted for the same Ministers of Magic who
pledged to move their cells closer to the Dementors. I admit, Mr.
Potter, that I see little hope for democracy as an effective form
of government, but I admire the poetry of how it makes its victims
complicit in their own destruction."</p>
<p>Harry's recently cohered self was threatening to shatter into
fragments again, the words falling like hammerstrikes on his
consciousness, driving him back, step by step, over the precipice
where lurked some vast abyss; and he was trying to find something
to save himself, some clever retort that would refute the words,
but it did not come.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor watched Harry, the gaze reflecting more
curiosity than command. "It is very simple, Mr. Potter, to
understand how Azkaban was built, and how it continues to be. Men
care for what they, themselves, expect to suffer or gain; and so
long as they do not expect it to redound upon themselves, their
cruelty and carelessness is without limit. All the other wizards of
this country are no different within than he who sought to rule
over them, You-Know-Who; they only lack his power and his...
frankness."</p>
<p>The boy's hands were clenched into fists so tightly that the
nails cut into his palm, if his fingers were white or his face was
pale you couldn't have seen that, for the dim blue light cast all
into ice or shadow. "You once offered to support me if my ambition
were to be the next Dark Lord. Is that why, Professor?"</p>
<p>The Defense Professor inclined his head, a thin smile on his
lips. "Learn all that I have to teach you, Mr. Potter, and you will
rule this country in time. Then you may tear down the prison that
democracy made, if you find that Azkaban still offends your
sensibilities. Like it or not, Mr. Potter, you have seen this day
that your own will conflicts with the will of this country's
populace, and that you do not bow your head and submit to their
decision when that occurs. So to them, whether or not they know it,
and whether or not you acknowledge it, you are their next Dark
Lord."</p>
<p>In the monochromatic light, unwavering, the boy and the Defense
Professor both seemed like motionless ice sculptures, the irises of
their eyes reduced to similar colors, looking very much the same in
that light.</p>
<p>Harry stared directly into those pale eyes. All the
long-suppressed questions, the ones he'd told himself he was
putting on hold until the Ides of May. That had been a lie, Harry
now knew, a self-deception, he had kept silent for fear of what he
might hear. And now everything was coming forth from his lips, all
at once. "On our first day of class, you tried to convince my
classmates I was a killer."</p>
<p>"You are." Amusedly. "But if your question is why I
<em>told</em> them that, Mr. Potter, the answer is that you will
find ambiguity a great ally on your road to power. Give a sign of
Slytherin on one day, and contradict it with a sign of Gryffindor
the next; and the Slytherins will be enabled to believe what they
wish, while the Gryffindors argue themselves into supporting you as
well. So long as there is uncertainty, people can believe whatever
seems to be to their own advantage. And so long as you appear
strong, so long as you appear to be winning, their instincts will
tell them that their advantage lies with you. Walk always in the
shadow, and light and darkness both will follow."</p>
<p>"And," said the boy, his voice level, "just what do <em>you</em>
want out of all this?"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell had leaned further back against the wall from
where he sat, casting his face into shadow, his eyes changing from
pale ice into dark pits like those of his snake form. "I wish for
Britain to grow strong under a strong leader; that <em>is</em> my
desire. As for my reasons why," Professor Quirrell smiled without
mirth, "I think they shall stay my own."</p>
<p>"The sense of doom that I feel around you." The words were
becoming harder and harder to say, as the subject danced closer and
closer to something terrible and forbidden. "You always knew what
it meant."</p>
<p>"I had several guesses," said Professor Quirrell, his expression
unreadable. "And I will not yet say all I guessed. But this much I
will tell you: it is <em>your</em> doom which flares when we come
near, not mine."</p>
<p>For once Harry's brain managed to mark this as a questionable
assertion and possible lie, instead of believing everything it
heard. "Why do you sometimes turn into a zombie?"</p>
<p>"Personal reasons," said Professor Quirrell with no humor at all
in his voice.</p>
<p>"What was your ulterior motive for rescuing Bellatrix?"</p>
<p>There was a brief silence, during which Harry tried hard to
control his breathing, keep it steady.</p>
<p>Finally the Defense Professor shrugged, as though it were of no
account. "I all but spelled it out for you, Mr. Potter. I told you
everything you needed to deduce the answer, if you had been mature
enough to consider that first obvious question. Bellatrix Black was
the Dark Lord's most powerful servant, her loyalty the most
assured; she was the single person most likely to be entrusted with
some part of the lost lore of Slytherin that should have been
yours."</p>
<p>Slowly the anger crept over Harry, slowly the wrath, something
terrible beginning to boil his blood, in just a few moments he
would say something that he really shouldn't say while the two of
them were alone in a deserted warehouse -</p>
<p>"But she <em>was</em> innocent," said the Defense Professor. He
was not smiling. "And the degree to which all her choices were
taken away from her, so that she never had a chance to suffer for
her <em>own</em> mistakes... it struck me as <em>excessive</em>,
Mr. Potter. If she tells you nothing of use -" The Defense
Professor gave another small shrug. "I shall not consider this
day's work a waste."</p>
<p>"How altruistic of you," Harry said coldly. "So if all wizards
are like You-Know-Who inside, are you an exception to that,
then?"</p>
<p>The Defense Professor's eyes were still in shadow, dark pits
that could not be met. "Call it a whim, Mr. Potter. It has
sometimes amused me to play the part of a hero. Who knows but that
You-Know-Who would say the same."</p>
<p>Harry opened his mouth a final time -</p>
<p>And found that he couldn't say it, he couldn't ask the last
question, the last and most important question, he couldn't make
the words come out. Even though a refusal like that was forbidden
to a rationalist, for all that he'd ever recited the Litany of
Tarski or the Litany of Gendlin or sworn that whatever could be
destroyed by the truth should be, in that one moment, he could not
bring himself to say his last question out loud. Even though he
knew he was thinking wrongly, even though he knew he was supposed
to be better than this, he still couldn't say it.</p>
<p>"Now it is my turn to inquire of you." Professor Quirrell's back
straightened from where it had leaned back against the glacier wall
of painted concrete. "I was wondering, Mr. Potter, if you had
anything to say about nearly killing me and ruining our mutual
endeavor. I am given to understand that an apology, in such cases,
is considered a sign of respect. But you have not offered me one.
Is it just that you have not yet gotten around to it, Mr.
Potter?"</p>
<p>The tone was calm, the quiet edge so fine and sharp that it
would slice all the way through you before you realized you were
being murdered.</p>
<p>And Harry just looked at the Defense Professor with cool eyes
that would never flinch from anything; not even death, now. He was
no longer in Azkaban, no longer fearful of the part of himself that
was fearless; and the solid gemstone that was Harry had rotated to
meet the stress, turning smoothly from one facet to another, from
light to darkness, warm to cold.</p>
<p><em>A calculated ploy on his part, to make me feel guilty, put
me in a position where I must submit?</em></p>
<p><em>Genuine emotion on his part?</em></p>
<p>"I see," said Professor Quirrell. "I suppose that answers -"</p>
<p>"No," said the boy in a cool, collected voice, "you do not get
to frame the conversation that easily, Professor. I went to
considerable lengths to protect you and get you out of Azkaban
safely, <em>after</em> I thought you had tried to kill a police
officer. That included facing down twelve Dementors without a
Patronus Charm. I wonder, if I had apologized when you demanded it,
would you have said thank-you in turn? Or am I correct in thinking
that it was my submission you demanded there, and not only my
respect?"</p>
<p>There was a pause, and then Professor Quirrell's voice came in
reply, openly icy with danger no longer veiled. "It seems you still
cannot bring yourself to lose, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>Darkness stared out of Harry's eyes without flinching, the
Defense Professor himself reduced to a mortal thing within them.
"Oh, and are <em>you</em> pondering now, whether <em>you</em>
should pretend to lose to me, and pretend to humble yourself before
my own anger, in order to preserve your own plans? Did the thought
of a calculated false apology even <em>cross your mind?</em> Me
neither, Professor Quirrell."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor laughed, low and humorless, emptier than
the void between the stars, dangerous as any vacuum filled with
hard radiation. "No, Mr. Potter, you have not learned your lesson,
not at all."</p>
<p>"I thought of losing many times, in Azkaban," said the boy, his
voice level. "That I ought to simply give up, and turn myself over
to the Aurors. Losing would have been the sensible thing to do. I
heard your voice saying it to me, in my mind; and I would have
<em>done</em> it, if I had been there by myself. But I could not
bring myself to lose <em>you</em>."</p>
<p>There was silence, then, for a time; as though even the Defense
Professor could not quite think of what to say to that.</p>
<p>"I am curious," said Professor Quirrell at last. "What do you
think that I should apologize for, precisely? I gave you explicit
instructions in the event of a fight. You were to stay down, stay
out of the way, cast no magic. You violated those instructions and
brought down the mission."</p>
<p>"I made no decision," the boy said evenly, "there was no choice
in it, only a wish that the Auror should not die, and my Patronus
was there. For that wish to have never occurred, you should have
warned me that you might bluff using a Killing Curse. By default, I
assume that if you point your wand at someone and say Avada
Kedavra, it is because you want them dead. Shouldn't that be the
first rule of Unforgivable Curse Safety?"</p>
<p>"Rules are for duels," said the Defense Professor. Some of the
coldness had returned to his voice. "And dueling is a sport, not a
branch of Battle Magic. In a real fight, a curse which cannot be
blocked and <em>must</em> be dodged is an indispensable tactic. I
would have thought this obvious to you, but it seems I misjudged
your intellect."</p>
<p>"It also seems to me imprudent," said the boy, continuing as
though the other had not spoken, "to not <em>tell me</em> that my
casting any spell on you might kill us both. What if you had
suffered some mishap, and I had tried an Innervate, or a Hover
Charm? That ignorance, which you permitted for purposes I cannot
guess, played also some part in this catastrophe."</p>
<p>There was another silence. The Defense Professor's eyes had
narrowed, and there was a faintly puzzled look on his face, as
though he had encountered some completely unfamiliar situation; and
still the man spoke no word.</p>
<p>"Well," said the boy. His eyes had not wavered from the Defense
Professor's. "I certainly regret hurting you, Professor. But I do
not think the situation calls for me to submit to you. I never
really did understand the concept of apology, still less as it
applies to a situation like this; if you have my regrets, but not
my submission, does that count as saying sorry?"</p>
<p>Again that cold, cold laugh, darker than the void between the
stars.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't know," said the Defense Professor, "I, too, never
understood the concept of apology. That ploy would be futile
between us, it seems, with both of us knowing it for a lie. Let us
speak no more of it, then. Debts will be settled between us in
time."</p>
<p>There was silence for a time.</p>
<p>"By the way," said the boy. "Hermione Granger would never have
built Azkaban, no matter who was going to be put in it. And she'd
die before she hurt an innocent. Just mentioning that, since you
said before that all wizards are like You-Know-Who inside, and
that's just false as a point of simple fact. Would've realized it
earlier if I hadn't been," the boy gave a brief grim smile,
"stressed out."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor's eyes were half-lidded, his expression
distant. "People's insides are not always like their outsides, Mr.
Potter. Perhaps she simply wishes others to think of her as a good
girl. She cannot use the Patronus Charm -"</p>
<p>"Hah," said the boy; his smile seemed realer now, warmer. "She's
having trouble for exactly the same reason I did. There's enough
light in her to destroy Dementors, I'm sure. She wouldn't be able
to <em>stop</em> herself from destroying Dementors, even at the
cost of her own life..." The boy trailed off, and then his voice
resumed. "<em>I</em> might not be such a good person, maybe; but
they do exist, and she's one of them."</p>
<p>Dryly. "She is young, and to make a show of kindness costs her
little."</p>
<p>There was a pause at this. Then the boy said, "Professor, I have
to ask, when you see something all dark and gloomy, doesn't it ever
occur to you to try and <em>improve</em> it somehow? Like, yes,
something goes terribly wrong in people's heads that makes them
think it's great to torture criminals, but that doesn't mean
they're truly evil inside; and maybe if you taught them the right
things, showed them what they were doing wrong, you could change
-"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell laughed, then, and not with the emptiness of
before. "Ah, Mr. Potter, sometimes I do forget how very young you
are. Sooner you could change the color of the sky." Another
chuckle, this one colder. "And the reason it is easy for you to
forgive such fools and think well of them, Mr. Potter, is that you
yourself have not been sorely hurt. You will think less fondly of
commonplace idiots after the first time their folly costs you
something dear. Such as a hundred Galleons from your own pocket,
perhaps, rather than the agonizing deaths of a hundred strangers."
The Defense Professor was smiling thinly. He took a pocket-watch
out of his robes, looked at it. "Let us depart now, if there is
nothing more to say between us."</p>
<p>"You don't have any questions about the impossible things I did
to get us out of Azkaban?"</p>
<p>"No," said the Defense Professor. "I believe I have solved most
of them already. As for the rest, it is too rare that I find a
person whom I cannot see through immediately, be they friend or
foe. I shall unravel the puzzles about you for myself, in due
time."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor shoved himself up, pushing back on the
wall with both hands and rising to his feet, smoothly if too
slowly. The boy, less gracefully, did the same.</p>
<p>And the boy blurted out the last most terrible question which he
had earlier been unable to ask; as though to say it aloud would
make it real, and as though it were not, already, vastly
obvious.</p>
<p>"Why am I not like the other children my own age?"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>In a deserted side-road of Diagon Alley, where scraps of
un-Vanished trash could be seen lodged into the edges of the brick
street and the blank brick building-sides that surrounded it, along
with scattered dirt and other signs of neglect, an ancient wizard
and his phoenix Apparated into existence.</p>
<p>The wizard was already reaching within his robes for his
hourglass when, in habit, his eyes jumped to a random spot between
the road and the wall, to memorize it -</p>
<p>And the old wizard blinked in surprise; there was a scrap of
parchment in that spot.</p>
<p>A frown crossed Albus Dumbledore's face as he took a step
forward and took the crumpled scrap, unfolding it.</p>
<p>On it was the single word "NO", and nothing more.</p>
<p>Slowly the wizard let it flutter from his fingers. Absently he
reached down to the pavement, and picked up the nearest scrap of
parchment, which looked remarkably similar to the one he had just
taken; he touched it with his wand, and a moment later it was
inscribed with the same word "NO", in the same handwriting, which
was his own.</p>
<p>The old wizard had planned to go back three hours to when Harry
Potter first arrived in Diagon Alley. He had already watched, upon
his instruments, the boy leaving Hogwarts, and that could not be
undone (his one attempt to fool his own instruments, and so control
Time without altering its appearance to himself, had ended in
sufficient disaster to convince him to never again try such
trickery). He had hoped to retrieve the boy at the first possible
moment after his arrival, and take him to another safe location, if
not Hogwarts (for his instruments had not shown the boy's return).
But now -</p>
<p>"A paradox if I retrieve him immediately after he arrives in
Diagon Alley?" murmured the old wizard to himself. "Perhaps they
did not set in motion their plan to rob Azkaban, until after they
had confirmed his arrival here... or else... perhaps..."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Painted concrete, hard floor and distant ceilings, two figures
facing off across from each other. One entity who wore the shape of
a man in his late thirties and already balding, and another mind
that wore the form of an eleven-year-old boy with a scar upon his
forehead. Ice and shadow, pale blue light.</p>
<p>"I don't know," said the man.</p>
<p>The boy just looked at him. And then said, "Oh, really?"</p>
<p>"Truly," said the man. "I know nothing, and of my guesses I will
not speak. Yet I will say this much -"</p>

11<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>Through green flame they whirled, through the Floo network they
spun, Minerva's heart racing with a pounding horror that she hadn't
felt in ten years and three months, the corridors between space
coughed and spit them out into the lobby of Gringotts (the safest
Floo receiver in Diagon Alley, the connection most difficult to
intercept, the fastest way out of Hogwarts without a phoenix). A
goblin attendant turned toward them, his eyes widened, he began a
slightly respectful bow -</p>
<p><em>Determination, Destination, Deliberation!</em></p>
<p>And the two of them were in the alley just in back of Mary's
Place, wands already out and raised, spinning around back-to-back
and the words of an Anti-Disillusionment Charm already rising to
Severus's lips.</p>
<p>The alley was empty.</p>
<p>When she turned back to look at Severus, his wand was already
cracking down on his own head with a sound like smashing an egg, as
his lips chanted words of invisibility; he took on the colors of
his surroundings, became a blur of his surroundings, the blur moved
and matched what was behind him and then there was nothing
there.</p>
<p>She lowered her wand and stepped forward to receive her own
Disillusionment -</p>
<p>From behind her, the unmistakable sound of a burst of flame.</p>
<p>She spun and saw Albus there, his long wand already drawn and
raised in his right hand. His eyes were grim beneath the
half-circles of his glasses, and Fawkes upon his shoulder had
spread his fire-colored wings in readiness for flight and
fight.</p>
<p>"Albus!" she said. "I thought -" She'd just seen him depart for
Azkaban, and she'd thought not even phoenixes could return from
there so easily.</p>
<p>Then she realized.</p>
<p>"She escaped," said Albus. "Did your Patronus reach him?"</p>
<p>The pounding in her heart grew stronger, the horror in her veins
solidified. "He said he was here, in the washroom -"</p>
<p>"Let us hope he spoke true," said Albus, the wand tapped her
head with a sensation like water trickling over her, and a moment
later the four of them (even Fawkes had been rendered invisible,
though sometimes you saw a flicker of something like fire in his
air) were racing to the front of the restaurant. They paused before
the door while Albus whispered something, and a moment later one of
the customers visible through the windows stood up with a vague
look on his face and opened the door as though taking a quick look
outside for some friend; and the three of them were through, racing
past the unwitting customers (Severus was marking their faces,
Minerva knew, and Albus would see any Disillusioned) toward the
sign that pointed to the washroom -</p>
<p>An old wooden door marked with the sign of a toilet burst open
with a slam, and four invisible rescuers stormed through it.</p>
<p>The small but clean wooden room was empty, fresh droplets of
water showed in the sink but there was no sign of Harry, only a
sheet of paper left on the closed lid of the toilet.</p>
<p>She couldn't breathe.</p>
<p>The sheet of paper rose up into the air as Albus took it, and a
moment later was thrust in her own direction.</p>
<p><em>M: What did the hat tell me to tell you?</em></p>
<p><em>- H</em></p>
<p>"Ah," Minerva said aloud in surprise, her mind taking a moment
to place the question, it wasn't the sort of thing you'd forget but
she hadn't been thinking in that <em>mode,</em> really - "I'm an
impudent youngster and I should get off its lawn."</p>
<p>"<em>Eh?</em> " said the air in Albus's voice, as if even he
could be shocked.</p>
<p>And then Harry Potter's head appeared, suspended next to the air
beside the toilet, his face was cold and alert, the too-adult Harry
she'd seen sometimes, eyes darting back and forth and around.</p>
<p>"What's going on -" the boy began.</p>
<p>Albus, now visible once more along with her and Fawkes, was
moving forward in an instant, his left hand reached forward and
plucked a hair from Harry's head (producing a startled yelp from
the boy), Minerva accepted the hair in her own hand, and a moment
later Albus swept up the mostly-invisible boy in his arms and there
was a flash of red-golden fire.</p>
<p>And Harry Potter was safe.</p>
<p>Minerva took a few steps forward, leaned against the wall where
Albus and Harry had been, trying to recover her poise.</p>
<p>She'd... lost some habits, in the ten years since the Order of
the Phoenix had disbanded.</p>
<p>Beside her, Severus shimmered into visibility. His right hand
was already drawing forth the flask from his robes, his left hand
already stretching forth in demand. She gave him Harry's hair, and
a moment later, it dropped into the flask of unfinished Polyjuice,
which at once began fizzing and bubbling as it settled into the
potency that would enable Severus to act his part as bait.</p>
<p>"That was unexpected," the Potions Master said slowly. "Why did
our Headmaster not retrieve Mr. Potter <em>earlier</em>, I wonder,
if he was going so far as to twist Time? There should have been
nothing preventing him from doing so... indeed, your Patronus
should have found Mr. Potter already safe..."</p>
<p>She hadn't thought of that, a different realization having
jumped to the forefront of her mind. It wasn't nearly as horrifying
as Bellatrix Black having escaped from Azkaban, but still -</p>
<p>"Harry has an <em>invisibility cloak?</em> " she said.</p>
<p>The Potions Master did not answer; he was shrinking.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Tick-snick, drip-blip, ding-ring-ting-</p>
<p>It still annoyed her, though it faded past attention after a
while; and when and if she became Headmistress, she intended to
Silence the whole lot. Which Head of Hogwarts, she wondered, had
first been so inconsiderate as to create a device that made
<em>noise</em>, to pass on to their successors?</p>
<p>She was sitting in the Headmaster's office with a quickly
Transfigured desk of her own, doing some of the hundred little
pieces of necessary paperwork that kept Hogwarts from grinding to a
halt; she could lose herself in it easily, and it prevented her
from thinking about other things. Albus had once remarked, sounding
rather wry, that Hogwarts seemed to run even more smoothly when
there was an outside crisis for her to avoid thinking about...</p>
<p>...ten years ago, that was the last time Albus had said
that.</p>
<p>There was the chime that indicated an approaching visitor.</p>
<p>Minerva kept reading her current parchment.</p>
<p>The door slammed open, revealing Severus Snape, who took three
steps inward and demanded without the slightest pause, "Any word
from Mad-Eye?"</p>
<p>Albus was already rising from his chair, even as she tucked away
her parchments and dispelled the desk. "Moody's Patronus is
reporting to the me in Azkaban," Albus said. "His Eye saw nothing;
and if the Eye of Vance does not see a thing, then that thing does
not exist. Yourself?"</p>
<p>"No one has tried to forcibly take my blood," Severus said. He
gave a quick grimace of a smile. "Except the Defense
Professor."</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " said Minerva.</p>
<p>"He saw me for an impostor before I could even open my lips, and
quite reasonably attacked me on the spot, demanding to know the
whereabouts of Mr. Potter." Another grimace of a smile. "Shouting
that I was Severus Snape did not seem to reassure him, for some
reason. I do believe that man would kill me for a Sickle and give
back five Knuts change. I had to stun our good Professor Quirrell,
which was not easy, and then he reacted poorly to the hex. 'Harry
Potter', naturally alarmed, ran out and told the owner, and the
Defense Professor was taken to St. Mungos -"</p>
<p>"<em>St. Mungos?</em> "</p>
<p>"- which said he had probably been overworking himself for weeks
before he collapsed, such was his state of exhaustion. Your
precious Defense Professor is fine, Minerva, the stunner may have
helped him by forcing him to take a few days off. Afterward I
declined the offer of a Floo to Hogwarts, and went back to Diagon
Alley and wandered; but no one seems to have wanted Mr. Potter's
blood today."</p>
<p>"Our Defense Professor is in the best of hands, I am sure," said
Albus. "Greater matters command our attention, Minerva."</p>
<p>It took considerable effort for her to wrench her attention
back, but she sat back down, and Severus gestured up a chair for
himself as well, and the three of them drew together to begin their
council.</p>
<p>She felt like a Polyjuiced impostor, sitting with those two. War
was not her art, nor plotting. She had to strain to keep one step
ahead of the Weasley twins, and sometimes she failed at that. She
was sitting here, ultimately, only because she had heard the
prophecy...</p>
<p>"We are faced," the Headmaster spoke first, "with a rather
alarming mystery. I can think of only two wizards who might have
engineered this escape."</p>
<p>Minerva drew in her breath sharply. "There is a chance it is
<em>not</em> You-Know-Who?"</p>
<p>"I'm afraid so," said the Headmaster.</p>
<p>She glanced to her side and saw that Severus looked as puzzled
as herself. <em>Afraid</em> the Dark Lord was not rising again? She
would have given almost anything for that to be true.</p>
<p>"So," Albus said heavily. "Our first suspect is Voldemort, risen
again and seeking to resurrect himself. I have studied many books I
wish I had not read, seeking his every possible avenue of return,
and I have found only three. His strongest road to life is the
Philosopher's Stone, which Flamel assures me that not even
Voldemort could create on his own; by that road he would rise
greater and more terrible than ever before. I would not have
thought Voldemort able to resist the temptation of the Stone, still
less because such an obvious trap is a challenge to his wit. But
his second avenue is nearly as strong: The flesh of his servant,
willingly given; the blood of his foe, forcibly taken; and the bone
of his ancestor, unknowingly bequeathed. Voldemort is a
perfectionist -" Albus glanced at Severus, who nodded agreement, "-
and he would certainly seek the most powerful combination: the
flesh of Bellatrix Black, the blood of Harry Potter, and the bone
of his father. Voldemort's final avenue is to seduce a victim and
drain the life from them over a long period; in which case
Voldemort would be weak compared to his former power. His motive to
spirit away Bellatrix is clear. And if he is keeping her in
reserve, to use only in case he cannot attain the Stone, that would
explain why no kidnap attempt was made on Harry this day."</p>
<p>Minerva glanced again at Severus, saw him listening attentively
but without surprise.</p>
<p>"What is <em>not</em> clear," the Headmaster continued, "is
<em>how</em> Voldemort could have engineered this escape. A death
doll was left in Bellatrix's place, her escape was meant to be
undetected; and even though that went wrong, the Dementors could
not find her after their first warning. Azkaban has stood
impenetrable for centuries, and I cannot imagine any means by which
Voldemort could have accomplished this."</p>
<p>"That may mean little," Severus said, expressionless. "For the
Dark Lord to do what we cannot imagine requires only that he has a
better imagination."</p>
<p>Albus nodded grimly. "Unfortunately there is now another wizard
who laughs at impossibilities. A wizard who, not long ago,
developed a new and powerful Charm which could have blinded the
Dementors to Bellatrix Black's escape. And he is implicated for
other reasons, as well."</p>
<p>Minerva's heart was skipping beats, she didn't know
<em>how,</em> or <em>why,</em> but a terrible apprehension was
dawning on her as to <em>who -</em></p>
<p>"Who would <em>that</em> be?" said Severus, sounding
puzzled.</p>
<p>Albus leaned back and said the fatal words, even as she had
feared them: "Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres."</p>
<p>"<em>Potter?</em> " demanded the Potions Master, as much shock
in that usually-silken voice as she had ever heard from him.
"Headmaster, is this one of your jokes? He is in his first year at
Hogwarts! A temper tantrum and a few childish pranks with an
invisibility cloak does not make him -"</p>
<p>"It is no joke," said Minerva, her voice barely above a whisper.
"Harry is already making original discoveries in Transfiguration,
Severus. Though I did not know he was researching Charms as
well."</p>
<p>"Harry is no ordinary first-year," the Headmaster said solemnly.
"He is marked as the Dark Lord's equal, and he has power the Dark
Lord knows not."</p>
<p>Severus was looking at her, and you would have needed to know
him well to recognize that his glance was pleading. "Am I to take
this seriously?"</p>
<p>Minerva simply nodded.</p>
<p>"Does anyone <em>else</em> know of this... new and powerful
Charm?" Severus demanded.</p>
<p>The Headmaster glanced at her apologetically -</p>
<p>Somehow she knew, she knew before he even said it, and she
wanted to scream at the top of her lungs.</p>
<p>- and said, "Quirinus Quirrell."</p>
<p>"<em>Why,</em>" she said, in a voice that should have melted
half the devices in the office, "<em>did Mr. Potter even TELL our
Defense Professor about his brilliant new Charm for breaking out of
prisons -</em>"</p>
<p>The Headmaster passed a weary wrinkled hand across his equally
wrinkled forehead. "Quirinus just happened to be there, Minerva.
Even I saw no harm in it at the time." The Headmaster hesitated.
"And Harry said his Charm was too dangerous to be explained to
either of us; and when I asked him again, this day, he insisted he
had still not explained it to Quirinus, nor had he ever dropped his
Occlumency barriers in the Defense Professor's presence -"</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter is an <em>Occlumens?</em> You gave him an
invisibility cloak and he is immune to Veritaserum <em>and he is
friends with the Weasley twins?</em> Albus, do you have any idea
what you have unleashed upon this school?" Her voice was nearly
shrieking, now. "By his seventh year there won't be anything left
of Hogwarts but a smoking hole in the ground!"</p>
<p>Albus leaned back in his great cushioned chair, and said,
smiling, "Don't forget the Time-Turner."</p>
<p>She did scream then, but quietly.</p>
<p>Severus drawled, "Should I teach him to brew Polyjuice,
Headmaster? I ask only for the sake of completeness, in case you
are not satisfied with the magnitude of your pet disaster."</p>
<p>"Perhaps next year," said Albus. "My dearest friends, the
question before us is whether Harry Potter has spirited Bellatrix
Black out of Azkaban, which is more than youthful high spirits even
by my tolerant standards."</p>
<p>"Excuse me, Headmaster," Severus said with one of the dryer
smiles she had ever seen him deliver to Albus, "but I will register
my opinion that the answer is no. This is the Dark Lord's work,
pure and simple."</p>
<p>"Then why," Albus said, and now there was no humor at all in his
voice, "when I planned to retrieve Harry immediately after his
arrival in Diagon Alley, did I find that this would result in
paradox?"</p>
<p>Minerva sank further back into her chair, dropped her left elbow
onto the hard uncushioned armrest, leaned her head into her hand,
and shut her eyes in despair.</p>
<p>There was a narrowly circulated proverb to the effect that only
one Auror in thirty was qualified to investigate cases involving
Time-Turners; and that of those few, the half who weren't
<em>already</em> insane, soon would be.</p>
<p>"So you suspect," Severus's voice was saying, "that Potter went
from Diagon Alley to Azkaban, then looped back to Diagon Alley
afterward to be picked up by us -"</p>
<p>"Precisely," said Albus's voice. "Though it is also possible
that Voldemort or his servants watched to make sure Harry did
arrive in Diagon Alley, before they began their attempt on Azkaban.
And that they had someone with a Time-Turner who would send back
the message of their success, to trigger the abduction. Indeed, it
was my suspicion of this possibility that caused me to dispatch you
and Minerva on your own mission, before I myself went to Azkaban. I
thought then that their breakout would fail, but if retrieving
Harry Potter meant observing the fact of their eventual failure,
then I myself could not have gone to Azkaban after I had interacted
with him, for Azkaban's future cannot touch its past. When, in
Azkaban, I received no report from you or Minerva, nor from
Flitwick whom I told to try contacting you, I knew that your
interaction with Harry Potter had been an interaction with
Azkaban's future, meaning that someone was sending messages through
Time -"</p>
<p>Then Albus's voice stopped.</p>
<p>"But Headmaster," said Severus, "<em>you</em> came back from
Azkaban's future and interacted with us..."</p>
<p>The Potions Master's voice trailed off.</p>
<p>"But Severus, if I had <em>received</em> reports from you and
Minerva of Harry's safety, I would not, in the first place, have
gone backward in time to -"</p>
<p>"Headmaster, I think we must draw diagrams for this."</p>
<p>"I agree, Severus."</p>
<p>There was the sound of parchment being spread on a table, and
then quills scratching, and more arguing.</p>
<p>Minerva sat in her chair, head resting in her hand, eyes
shut.</p>
<p>There was a story she'd once heard about a criminal who had
possessed a Time-Turner which the Department of Mysteries had
sealed to him, in a case of extremely bad judgment as to who needed
one; and there had been an Auror assigned to track down this
unknown time-criminal, who had also been given a Time-Turner; and
the story ended with both of them in St. Mungo's ward for Total
Unrecoverable Nutcases.</p>
<p>Minerva sat there with her eyes shut, trying not to listen,
trying not to think about it, and trying not to go insane.</p>
<p>After awhile, when the argument seemed to have wound down, she
said aloud, "Mr. Potter's Time-Turner is restricted to the hours of
nine PM through midnight. Was the shell tampered with, Albus?"</p>
<p>"Not to my most discerning Charms," said Albus. "But the shells
are new things; and to defeat the Unspeakables' precautions and
leave no trace of the defeat... might <em>not</em> be
impossible."</p>
<p>She opened her eyes, and saw Severus and the Headmaster staring
intently at a parchment covered with tangled squiggles that would
have no doubt driven her mad to comprehend.</p>
<p>"Have you come to any <em>conclusions?</em> " Minerva said. "And
please don't tell me how you arrived at them."</p>
<p>Severus and the Headmaster looked at each other, then turned to
look at her.</p>
<p>"We have concluded," the Headmaster said gravely, "that either
Harry was involved or he was not; that either Voldemort has access
to a Time-Turner or he does not; and that regardless of what could
have happened within Azkaban, nobody would have visited the Little
Hangleton graveyard during the period Moody has already watched
over it within my own past."</p>
<p>"In short," Severus drawled, "we know nothing, dear Minerva;
though it seems at least <em>likely</em> that another Time-Turner
was involved, somehow. My own suspicion is that Potter has been
bribed, tricked, or threatened into conveying messages backward in
time, perhaps even regarding this very prison break. I shall not
make the obvious suggestion as to who is pulling his strings. But I
suggest that at nine o' clock tonight, we test whether Potter is
able to travel the full six hours backward to three o' clock, to
see if he has yet used his Time-Turner."</p>
<p>"That seems wise to do in any case," said Dumbledore. "See that
done, Minerva, and tell Harry to stop in my office at his
convenience, afterward."</p>
<p>"But you still suspect Harry of direct involvement in the prison
break itself?" Minerva said.</p>
<p>"Possible but unlikely," said Severus, at the same time Albus
said, "Yes."</p>
<p>Minerva pinched the bridge of her nose, took a deep breath, let
it out. "Albus, Severus, what possible <em>reason</em> has Mr.
Potter to do such a thing!"</p>
<p>"None that I can think of," said Albus, "but it remains that
Harry's magics alone, of all the means known to me, might have
-"</p>
<p>"Hold," said Severus. All expression vanished from his face. "A
thought occurs to me, I must check -" The Potions Master seized a
pinch of Floo powder, strode across the room toward the fireplace -
Albus hastily waved his wand to light it - and then in a flare of
green flame, and the words "Slytherin Head of House office",
Severus was gone.</p>
<p>She and Albus looked at each other and both shrugged; and then
Albus turned back to studying the parchment.</p>
<p>It was only a few minutes later that Severus spun back out of
the Floo, brushing traces of ash from himself.</p>
<p>"Well," said the Potions Master. Again the expressionless face.
"I am afraid that Mr. Potter does have a motive."</p>
<p>"Speak!" said Albus.</p>
<p>"I found Lesath Lestrange in the Slytherin common room,
studying," Severus said. "He was not reluctant to meet my eyes. And
it seems that Mr. Lestrange did not like to think of his parents in
Azkaban, in the cold and the darkness, with the Dementors sucking
away their life, hurting every second of every day, and he told Mr.
Potter so in as many words, and begged him to get them out. Since,
you see, Mr. Lestrange had heard that the Boy-Who-Lived could do
anything."</p>
<p>She and Albus exchanged glances.</p>
<p>"Severus," Minerva said, "<em>surely...</em> even
<em>Harry</em>... has more common sense than <em>that...</em>"</p>
<p>Her voice trailed off.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter thinks he is God," Severus said without expression,
"and Lesath Lestrange fell to his knees before him in a heartfelt
cry of prayer."</p>
<p>Minerva stared at Severus, feeling sick to her stomach. She had
studied Muggle religion - it was the most common reason for needing
to Memory-Charm the parents of Muggleborns - and she knew enough to
understand what Severus had just said.</p>
<p>"In any case," said the Potions Master. "I looked within Mr.
Lestrange to see if he knew anything of his mother's escape. He has
heard nothing. But the instant he learns, he will conclude that the
person responsible was Harry Potter."</p>
<p>"I see..." Albus said slowly. "Thank you, Severus. That is good
news."</p>
<p>"<em>Good news?</em> " Minerva burst out.</p>
<p>Albus looked at her, his face as expressionless as Severus's,
now; and she remembered, with a shock, that Albus's own - "It is
the best reason I can possibly imagine for removing Bellatrix from
Azkaban," Albus said quietly. "And if it is <em>not</em> Harry, let
us recall, then it is certainly Voldemort himself making his first
moves. But let us not be hasty in judgment while there is much we
do not yet know, but soon will."</p>
<p>Albus once more stood up from behind his desk, strode to the
fireplace still alight, cast in another pinch of green powder, and
stuck his head into the flames. "Department of Magical Law
Enforcement," he said, "Director's office."</p>
<p>After a moment, the voice of Madam Bones came through clear and
sharp, "What is it, Albus? I am somewhat busy."</p>
<p>"Amelia," said Albus, "I beg of you to share any discoveries you
have made concerning this matter."</p>
<p>There was a pause. "Oh," said the cold voice of Madam Bones from
the blazing fire, "and is that a two-way road then, Albus?"</p>
<p>"It may be," the old wizard said calmly.</p>
<p>"If any Auror dies of your reticence, old meddler, I will hold
you responsible in full measure."</p>
<p>"I understand, Amelia," Albus said, "but I have no wish to spark
needless alarm and incredulity -"</p>
<p>"<em>Bellatrix Black</em> has escaped from <em>Azkaban!</em>
What alarm or incredulity do you think I will call
<em>needless,</em> in the face of that?"</p>
<p>"I may call on you to remember those words," said the old wizard
into the green flames. "For if I learn that my fears are not
needless, I <em>will</em> tell you. Now, Amelia, I beg you, if you
have learned anything whatsoever upon this matter, please share
it."</p>
<p>There was another pause, and then Madam Bones's voice said, "I
have information which I learned four hours into the future, Albus.
Do you still want it?"</p>
<p>Albus paused -</p>
<p>(weighing, Minerva knew, the possibility that he might want to
go back more than two hours from this instant; for you couldn't
send information further back in time than six hours, not through
any chain of Time-Turners)</p>
<p>- and finally said, "Yes, please."</p>
<p>"We had a lucky break," said Madam Bones's voice, "one of the
Aurors who witnessed the escape was a Muggleborn, and she told us
that the Flying-Fire spell, as we were calling it, might be no
spell at all, but a Muggle artifact."</p>
<p>Like a punch in the stomach, that was how it felt, and the
sickness in Minerva's belly redoubled. Anyone who'd watched a Chaos
Legion battle knew whose hand that showed...</p>
<p>Madam Bones's voice continued. "We brought in Arthur Weasley
from Misuse of Muggle Artifacts - he knows more about Muggle
artifacts than any wizard alive - and gave him the descriptions
from the Aurors on the scene, and he cracked it. It was a Muggle
artifact called a rocker, and they call it that because you'd have
to be off your rocker to ride one. Just six years ago one of their
rockers blew up, killed hundreds of Muggles in a flash and almost
set fire to the Moon. Weasley says that rockers use a special kind
of science called opposite reaction, so the plan is to develop a
jinx which will prevent that science from working around
Azkaban."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Amelia," Albus said gravely. "Is that
everything?"</p>
<p>"I'll check if we have anything from six hours forward," said
the voice of Madam Bones, "if so they wouldn't have told me, but
I'll have them tell you. Do <em>you</em> have anything you want to
tell me, Albus? Which of those two possibilities is it looking
like?"</p>
<p>"Not yet, Amelia," Albus said, "but I may have word for you
soon."</p>
<p>He straightened up from the fire, then, which faded back to
ordinary yellow flames. Every minute of the old wizard's years,
every natural second since his birth and every second which
Time-Turning had added, all of that plus a few extra decades for
stress, was visible on his lined face.</p>
<p>"Severus?" the old wizard said. "What was it actually?"</p>
<p>"A rocket," said the half-blood Potions Master, who had grown up
in the Muggle town of Spinner's End. "One of the most impressive
Muggle technologies."</p>
<p>"How likely is <em>Harry</em> to know such arts?" said
Minerva.</p>
<p>Severus drawled, "Oh, a boy like Mr. Potter knows <em>all</em>
about rockets; that, dear Minerva, is a certainty. You must
remember that things are done differently in the Muggle world."
Severus frowned. "But rockets <em>are</em> dangerous, and
expensive..."</p>
<p>"Harry has stolen and hidden an unknown amount of money from his
Gringotts vault, perhaps thousands of Galleons," said the
Headmaster, and then, to their twin stares, "That was <em>not</em>
in my plan, but I made the mistake of sending the Defense Professor
to supervise Harry's withdrawal of five Galleons for Christmas
presents..." The Headmaster shrugged. "Yes, I agree, sheer folly in
retrospect, let us continue."</p>
<p>Minerva quietly thudded her head a few times against the
headrest of her chair.</p>
<p>"Nonetheless, Headmaster," Severus said. "Just because the Death
Eaters never used Muggle artifacts in the first war, that does not
mean <em>he</em> is ignorant. Rockets fell on Britain as weapons,
in the Muggle side of Grindelwald's war. If he spent the summers of
those years in a Muggle orphanage, as you told us, Headmaster...
then he, too, has heard of rockets. And if he has been listening to
reports of Mr. Potter and his mock battles using Muggle artifacts,
he would certainly learn his enemy's strengths and try to redouble
them himself. That is <em>just</em> how he thinks; any power he
sees he will try to take for his own."</p>
<p>The old wizard was standing stock still, utterly motionless,
even the hairs of his beard frozen in place like solid wires; and
the thought came to Minerva, as frightening as any thought she'd
ever had, that Albus Dumbledore was rooted to the spot in
horror.</p>
<p>"Severus," Albus Dumbledore said, and his voice almost cracked,
"do you realize what you are saying? If Harry Potter and Voldemort
fight their war with Muggle weapons there will be nothing left of
the world but fire!"</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " said Minerva. She had heard of guns, of
course, but they weren't <em>that</em> dangerous to an experienced
witch -</p>
<p>Severus spoke as though she weren't in the room. "Then perhaps,
Headmaster, he is sending a deliberate warning to Harry Potter of
exactly that; saying that any attack with Muggle weapons will be
met with retaliation in kind. Command Mr. Potter to cease his use
of Muggle technology in his battles; that will show him the message
is received... and not give him any more ideas." Severus frowned.
"Though, come to think of it, Mr. Malfoy - and of course Miss
Granger - well, on second thought a blanket prohibition on
technology seems wiser -"</p>
<p>The old wizard pressed both his hands to his forehead, and from
his lips came an unsteady voice, "I begin to <em>hope</em> that it
is Harry behind this escape... oh, Merlin defend us all, what have
I done, what have I done, what will become of the world?"</p>
<p>Severus shrugged. "From the rumors I have heard, Headmaster,
Muggle weapons are only slightly worse than the more...
<em>recondite</em> aspects of wizardry -"</p>
<p>"<em>Worse?</em> " gasped Minerva, and then shut her mouth as
though by force.</p>
<p>"Worse than any peril left in these fading years," said Albus.
"Not worse than that which erased Atlantis from Time."</p>
<p>Minerva stared at him, feeling the sweat break out all along her
spine.</p>
<p>Severus continued, still addressing Albus. "All the Death Eaters
save Bellatrix would have betrayed him, all his supporters turned
against him, all the powers of the world converged to destroy him,
if he had been reckless with any truly dangerous potency. Is this
so different, then?"</p>
<p>Some motion, some color, had returned to the old wizard's face.
"Perhaps not..."</p>
<p>"And in any case," Severus said with a slightly condescending
smile, "Muggle weapons are not so easy to obtain, not for a
thousand Galleons or a thousand thousand."</p>
<p><em>Doesn't Harry just Transfigure the devices he uses in his
battles?</em> thought Minerva, but before she could open her mouth
to ask -</p>
<p>The fireplace erupted in green flames, then, and the face of
Pius Thicknesse, Madam Bones's assistant, appeared therein. "Chief
Warlock?" said Thicknesse. "I have a report for you, transmitted
from -" Thicknesse's eyes flickered over Minerva and Severus, "six
minutes ago."</p>
<p>"Six hours ahead, you mean," said Albus. "These two are meant to
hear it; deliver your report."</p>
<p>"We know how it was done," said Thicknesse. "In Bellatrix
Black's cell, hidden in one corner, was a potions vial; and testing
the traces of remaining fluid shows that it was an Animagus
potion."</p>
<p>There was a long pause.</p>
<p>"I see..." Albus said heavily.</p>
<p>"Pardon me?" said Minerva. She didn't.</p>
<p>Thicknesse's head turned toward her. "Animagi, Madam McGonagall,
in their Animagus forms, are of less interest to Dementors. All
prisoners are tested before their arrival at Azkaban; and if they
are Animagi, their Animagus form is destroyed. But we had not
considered that someone protected by a Patronus Charm while taking
the potion and performing the meditation, might be able to become
an Animagus <em>after</em> they went to Azkaban -"</p>
<p>"I understood," Severus said, having by now put on his customary
sneer, "that the Animagus meditation required considerable
time."</p>
<p>"Well, Mr. Snape," Thicknesse barked, "records show that
Bellatrix Black was an Animagus <em>before</em> she was sentenced
to Azkaban and her form destroyed; so maybe her <em>second</em>
meditation didn't take as much time as her first!"</p>
<p>"I would not have thought it possible for any prisoner of
Azkaban to do such a thing..." Albus said. "But Bellatrix Black was
a most powerful sorceress before her incarceration, and she might
have done it if any witch could. Can Azkaban be secured against
this method?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said the confident head of Pius Thicknesse. "Our expert
says that it is nigh-unimaginable that an Animagus meditation could
be performed in less than three hours, regardless of experience.
All visits to prisoners allowed to receive them will be limited to
two hours henceforth, and the Dementors will inform us if any
Patronus Charm is maintained in the prison areas for longer than
that."</p>
<p>Albus looked unhappy at that, but nodded. "I see. There will be
no further attempts of that sort, of course, but do not relax your
vigilance. And when Amelia has been told all this, tell her that I
have information for her."</p>
<p>The head of Pius Thicknesse vanished without another word.</p>
<p>"No further attempts...?" said Minerva.</p>
<p>"Because, dear Minerva," Severus drawled, having not quite taken
off his habitual sneer, "if the Dark Lord had planned to free any
of his other servants from Azkaban, he would not have left behind
the vial of potion to tell us how it was done." Severus frowned. "I
confess... even so I do not see why that vial was left there."</p>
<p>"It is some kind of message..." Albus said slowly. "And I cannot
see what it means, not at all..." He drummed his fingers on his
desk.</p>
<p>For a long minute or three, the old wizard stared off into
nothingness, frowning; while Severus also sat in silence.</p>
<p>Then Albus shook his head in dismay, and said, "Severus, do
<em>you</em> comprehend this?"</p>
<p>"No," said the Potions Master, and with a sardonic smile, "which
is probably all the better for us; whatever we are
<em>intended</em> to conclude from it, that part of his plan has
misfired."</p>
<p>"You are certain, now, that it <em>is</em> You-Know... that it
is Voldemort?" said Minerva. "It could not be that some other Death
Eater conceived this clever notion?"</p>
<p>"And they knew about rockets, too?" Severus said dryly. "I don't
believe the other Death Eaters were so fond of Muggle Studies. It
is he."</p>
<p>"Aye, it is he," Albus said. "Azkaban has endured impenetrable
for ages, only to fall to an ordinary Animagus potion. It is too
clever and too impossible, which was ever Voldemort's signature
since the days he was known as Tom Riddle. Anyone who wished to
forge that signature must needs be as cunning as Voldemort himself
to do so. And there is no one else in the world who would
accidentally overestimate my wit, and leave me a message I cannot
understand at all."</p>
<p>"Unless he has gauged you exactly," Severus said tonelessly, "in
which case all that is just what he intended you to think."</p>
<p>Albus sighed. "Indeed. But even if he has tricked me perfectly,
we may at least rely on the conclusion that it was not Harry
Potter."</p>
<p>It should have come as a relief, and yet Minerva felt the chill
spreading through her spine and her veins, her lungs and her
bones.</p>
<p>She remembered conversations like this.</p>
<p>She remembered conversations like this from ten years ago, from
a time when blood had run through Britain in wide rivers, when
wizards and witches she had once taught in class had been
slaughtered by the hundreds, she remembered burning homes and
screaming children and flashes of green light -</p>
<p>"What will you tell Madam Bones?" she whispered.</p>
<p>Albus stood from his desk and paced to the center of the room,
his hand lightly touching the devices, here an instrument of light,
there an instrument of sound; he adjusted his glasses with one
hand, used the other to center the long silver beard against his
robes, and then finally that ancient wizard turned back and faced
them.</p>
<p>"I will tell her what little I know of the Dark Art called
horcrux, by which a soul is deprived of death," said Albus
Dumbledore, in a soft voice that seemed to fill the whole room,
"and I will tell her what may be done with the flesh of the
servant."</p>
<p>"I will tell her that I am reconstituting the Order of the
Phoenix."</p>
<p>"I will tell her that Voldemort has returned."</p>
<p>"And that the Second Wizarding War is begun."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Some hours later...</em></p>
<p>The antique old clock upon the wall of the Deputy Headmistress's
office had golden hands, and silver numerals to make the
clock-face; it ticked and jerked soundlessly through its motions,
for there was a Quieting enchantment on it.</p>
<p>The golden hour hand approached the silver numeral of nine, the
golden minute hand did the same, the two linked components of Time
nearing each other, soon to be in the same place and never to
collide.</p>
<p>It was 8:43 PM, and the time approached when Harry's Time-Turner
would open, to be tested in the one way that no imaginable spell
could fool, unless that spell could bypass the laws of Time itself.
No body or soul, no knowledge or substance, could stretch an extra
seven hours in a single day. She would make up a message on the
spot, and tell Harry to take that message back six hours to
Professor Flitwick at 3PM, and she would ask Professor Flitwick if
he had received it in that hour.</p>
<p>And Professor Flitwick would tell her that he had indeed
received it at 3PM.</p>
<p>And she would tell Severus and Albus to have a <em>little</em>
more faith in Harry next time.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall cast the Patronus Charm, and told her
shining cat, "Go to Mr. Potter, and tell him this: Mr. Potter,
please come to my office as soon as you hear this, without doing
anything else along the way."</p>

<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 62: The Stanford Prison Experiment,
Final<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>Minerva gazed up at the clock, the golden hands and silver
numerals, the jerking motion. Muggles had invented that, and until
they had, wizards had not bothered keeping time. Bells, timed by a
sanded hourglass, had served Hogwarts for its classes when it was
built. It was one of the things that blood purists wished not to be
true, and therefore Minerva knew it.</p>
<p>She had received an Outstanding on her Muggle Studies N.E.W.T.,
which now seemed to her a mark of shame, considering how little she
knew. Her younger self had realized, even then, that the class was
a sham, taught by a pureblood, supposedly because Muggleborns could
not appreciate what wizardborns needed to be told, and actually
because the Board of Governors did not approve of Muggles at all.
But when she was seventeen the Outstanding grade had been the main
thing that mattered to her, she was saddened to remember...</p>
<p><em>If Harry Potter and Voldemort fight their war with Muggle
weapons there will be nothing left of the world but fire!</em></p>
<p>She couldn't imagine it, and the reason she couldn't imagine it
was that she couldn't imagine Harry fighting You-Know-Who.</p>
<p>She had encountered the Dark Lord four times and survived each
one, three times with Albus to shield her and once with Moody at
her side. She remembered the damaged, snakelike face, the faint
green scales scattered over the skin, the glowing red eyes, the
voice that laughed in a high-pitched hiss and promised nothing but
cruelty and torment: the monster pure and complete.</p>
<p>And Harry Potter was easy to picture in her mind, the bright
expression on the face of a young boy who wavered between taking
the ludicrous seriously and taking the serious ludicrously.</p>
<p>And to think of the two of them facing off at wandpoint was too
painful to be imagined.</p>
<p>They had no right, no right at all to set this on an
eleven-year-old boy. She knew what the Headmaster had decided for
him this day, for she had been told to make the arrangements; and
if it had been her at the same age she would have raged and
screamed and cried and been inconsolable for weeks, and...</p>
<p><em>He is no ordinary first-year,</em> Albus had said. <em>He is
marked as the Dark Lord's equal, and he has power the Dark Lord
knows not.</em></p>
<p>The terrible hollow voice booming from Sybill Trelawney's
throat, the true and original prophecy, echoed once more through
her mind. She had a feeling it didn't mean what the Headmaster
thought it did, but there was no way to put the difference into
words.</p>
<p>And even so it still seemed true, that if there were any
eleven-year-old within the Earth entire who could bear this burden,
that boy approached her office now. And if she said anything at all
like 'poor Harry' to his face... well, he wouldn't like it.</p>
<p><em>So now I've got to find some way to kill an immortal Dark
Wizard,</em> Harry had said on the day he had first learned. <em>I
really wish you had told me that before I started
shopping...</em></p>
<p>She'd been Head of House Gryffindor for long enough, she'd
watched enough friends die, to know that there were some people you
couldn't save from becoming heroes.</p>
<p>There came a knock at the door, and Professor McGonagall said,
"Enter."</p>
<p>When Harry entered, his face had the same cold, alert look she'd
seen in Mary's Place; and she wondered for an instant if he'd been
wearing that same mask, that same self, this whole day.</p>
<p>The young boy seated himself on the chair before her desk, and
said, "So is it time for me to be told what's going on?" Neutral
the words, not the sharpness that should have gone with the
expression.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall's eyes rose in surprise before she could
stop them, and she said, "The Headmaster told you nothing, Mr.
Potter?"</p>
<p>The boy shook his head. "Only that he'd received a warning that
I might be in danger, but I was safe now."</p>
<p>Minerva was having trouble meeting his gaze. How could they
<em>do</em> this to him, how could they lay this upon an
eleven-year-old boy, this war, this destiny, this prophecy... and
they didn't even <em>trust</em> him...</p>
<p>She forced herself to look at Harry directly, and saw that his
green eyes were calm as they rested on her.</p>
<p>"Professor McGonagall?" the boy said quietly.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter," said Professor McGonagall, "I'm afraid it is not
my place to explain, but if after this the Headmaster
<em>still</em> does not tell you anything, you may come back to me
and I will go yell at him for you."</p>
<p>The boy's eyes widened, something of the real Harry showing
through the crack before the cool mask was set back in place.</p>
<p>"In any case," Professor McGonagall said briskly. "I'm sorry for
the inconvenience, Mr. Potter, but I need to ask you to use your
Time-Turner to go back six hours to three o'clock, and give the
following message to Professor Flitwick: Silver on the tree. Ask
the Professor to note down the time at which you gave him that
message. Afterward the Headmaster wishes to meet with you at your
convenience."</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>Then the boy said, "I am suspected of misusing my Time-Turner,
then?"</p>
<p>"Not by <em>me!</em> " Professor McGonagall said hastily. "I
<em>am</em> sorry for the inconvenience, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>There was another pause, and then the young boy shrugged. "It'll
play hob with my sleep schedule but I suppose it can't be helped.
Please let the house elves know that if I ask for an early
breakfast at, say, three A.M. tomorrow morning, I'm to receive
it."</p>
<p>"Of course, Mr. Potter," she said. "Thank you for
understanding."</p>
<p>The boy rose up from his chair and gave her a formal nod, then
slipped out the door with his hand already going under his shirt to
where his Time-Turner waited; and she almost called out
<em>Harry!</em> only she wouldn't have known what to say after.</p>
<p>Instead she waited, her eyes on the clock.</p>
<p>How long did she need to wait for Harry Potter to go back in
time?</p>
<p>She didn't need to wait at all, actually; if he had done it,
then it had already happened...</p>
<p>Minerva knew, then, that she was delaying because she was
nervous, and the realization saddened her. Mischief, yes,
unspeakable unthinkable mischief with all the prudence and
foresight of a falling rock - she didn't know how the boy had
tricked the Hat into not Sorting him to Gryffindor where he
obviously belonged - but nothing dark or harmful, not ever. Beneath
that mischief his goodness ran as deep and as true as the Weasley
twins', though not even the Cruciatus Curse could have gotten her
to say that out loud.</p>
<p>"<em>Expecto Patronum</em>," she said, and then, "Go to
Professor Flitwick, and bear back his reply after you ask him this:
'Did Mr. Potter give you a message from me, what was that message,
and when did you receive it?'"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>One hour earlier, having used the last remaining spin of his
Time-Turner after putting on the Cloak of Invisibility, Harry
tucked the hourglass back into his shirt.</p>
<p>And he set out toward the Slytherin dungeons, striding as
quickly as his invisible legs could manage, though not running.
Thankfully the Deputy Headmistress's office was already on a lower
floor of Hogwarts...</p>
<p>A few staircases later, taken two steps but not three steps at
once, Harry stopped at a corridor around whose final bend lay the
entrance to the Slytherin dorms.</p>
<p>Harry took a piece of parchment (not paper) out of his parch,
took a Quotes Quill (not pen) out of his pouch, and told the quill,
"Write these letters exactly as I say them: Z-P-G-B-S-Y, space,
F-V-Y-I-R-E-B-A-G-U-R-G-E-R-R."</p>
<p>There were two kinds of codes in cryptography, codes that
stopped your little brother from reading your message and codes
that stopped major governments from reading your message, and this
was the first kind of code, but it was better than nothing. In
theory, no one should read it anyway; but even if they did, they
wouldn't remember anything interesting unless they did cryptography
first.</p>
<p>Harry then put that parchment in a parchment envelope, and with
his wand melted a little green wax to seal it.</p>
<p>In principle, of course, Harry could've done all that hours
earlier, but somehow waiting until <em>after</em> he heard the
message from Professor McGonagall's own lips seemed less like
Messing With Time.</p>
<p>Harry then put that envelope inside another envelope, which
already contained another sheet of paper with other instructions,
and five silver Sickles.</p>
<p>He closed that envelope (which already had a name written on the
outside), sealed it with more green wax, and pressed a final Sickle
into that seal.</p>
<p>Then Harry put <em>that</em> envelope into the very last
envelope on which was written in large letters the name "Merry
Tavington".</p>
<p>And Harry peeked around the bend to where the scowling portrait
that served as the door to the Slytherin dorms waited; and as he
did not wish the portrait to recall not-seeing anyone invisible,
Harry used the Hover Charm to float the envelope to the scowling
man, and tap it against him.</p>
<p>The scowling man looked down at the envelope, peering at it
through a monocle, and sighed, and turned around to face toward the
inside of the Slytherin dorms, and called, "Message for Merry
Tavington!"</p>
<p>The envelope was then allowed to fall to the floor.</p>
<p>A few moments later the portrait door opened, and Merry snatched
up the envelope from the floor.</p>
<p>She would open it up and find a Sickle and an envelope addressed
to a fourth-year student named Margaret Bulstrode.</p>
<p>(Slytherins did this sort of thing all the time, and a Sickle
definitely constituted a rush order.)</p>
<p>Margaret would open <em>her</em> envelope, and find five Sickles
along with an envelope to be dropped off in an unused
classroom...</p>
<p>...<em>after</em> she used her Time-Turner to go back five
hours...</p>
<p>...whereupon she would find another five Sickles waiting for
her, if she got there quickly.</p>
<p>And an invisible Harry Potter would be waiting in that classroom
from three PM to three-thirty, just in case someone tried the
obvious test.</p>
<p>Well, it had been obvious to Professor Quirrell, anyway.</p>
<p>It had also been obvious to Professor Quirrell that (a) Margaret
Bulstrode had a Time-Turner and (b) she wasn't very strict about
how she used it, e.g. telling her younger sister really good pieces
of gossip "before" anyone else had heard.</p>
<p>Some of the tension leaked off Harry as he strode away from the
portrait door, still invisible. Somehow his mind had still managed
to worry about the plan, even <em>knowing</em> that it had already
succeeded. Now there remained only the confrontation with
Dumbledore, and then he was done for the day... he'd go to the
Headmaster's gargoyles at 9PM, since doing it at 8PM would seem
more suspicious. This way he could claim that he'd just
misunderstood what Professor McGonagall had meant by
"afterward"...</p>
<p>The obscure pain clutched at Harry's heart again as he thought
of Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>So Harry retreated a little further into his dark side, which
had worn the calm expression and kept the fatigue off his face, and
kept walking.</p>
<p>There would come a reckoning, but sometimes you had to borrow
everything you could today, and let the payments come due
tomorrow.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Even Harry's dark side was feeling the exhaustion by the time
the spiraling staircase had delivered him to the great oaken door
that was the final gate to Dumbledore's office; but since Harry was
now <em>legally</em> four hours past his natural bedtime, it was
safe to let some of the fatigue show, the physical if not the
emotional.</p>
<p>The oaken door swung open -</p>
<p>Harry's eyes had already been focused in the direction of the
great desk, the throne behind it; so it took a moment to register
that the throne was empty, the desk barren but for a single
leatherbound volume; and then Harry shifted his gaze to see the
wizard standing among his fiddly things, the mysterious unknown
devices in their scores. Fawkes and the Sorting Hat occupied their
respective perches, a bright cheerful blaze crackled in a nook that
Harry had not before realized was a fireplace, and there were the
two umbrellas and three red slippers for left feet. All things in
their place and in their customary appearance except the old wizard
himself, standing tall and dressed in robes of the most formal
black. It came as a shock to the eyes, those robes on that person,
it was as if Harry had seen his father wearing a business suit.</p>
<p>Very ancient was the appearance of Albus Dumbledore, and
sorrowful.</p>
<p>"Hello, Harry," said the old wizard.</p>
<p>From within an alternate self maintained like an Occlumency
construct, an innocent-Harry who had absolutely no idea what was
happening inclined his head coldly, and said, "Headmaster. I expect
you've heard back from Deputy Headmistress McGonagall by now, so if
it's fine by you, I would <em>really</em> like to know what is
going on."</p>
<p>"Yes," said the old wizard, "it is time, Harry Potter." The back
straightened, only slightly for the wizard had already been
standing straight; but somehow even that small change made the
wizard seem a foot taller, and stronger if not younger, formidable
though not dangerous, his potency gathered about him like a cowl.
In a clear voice, then, he spoke: "This day your war against
Voldemort has begun."</p>
<p>"What?" said the outer Harry who knew nothing, while something
watching from inside thought much the same only with a lot more
profanity attached.</p>
<p>"Bellatrix Black has been taken from Azkaban, she has escaped
from a prison inescapable," the old wizard said. "It is a feat that
bears Voldemort's signature if ever I have seen it; and she, his
most faithful servant, is one of three requisites he must obtain to
rise again in a new body. After ten years the enemy you once
defeated has returned, as was foretold."</p>
<p>Neither part of Harry could think of anything to say to that, at
least not for the few seconds before the old wizard continued.</p>
<p>"It need change little for you, for now," said the old wizard.
"I have begun reconstituting the Order of the Phoenix that will
serve you, I have alerted the few souls who can and should
understand: Amelia Bones, Alastor Moody, Bartemius Crouch, certain
others. Of the prophecy - yes, there is a prophecy - I have not
told them, but they know that Voldemort is returned, and they know
that you are to play some vital role. They and I shall fight your
war in its lesser beginnings, while you grow stronger, and perhaps
wiser, here at Hogwarts." The old wizard's hand came up, as though
beseeching. "So to you, for now, there is but one change, and I
implore you to understand its necessity. Do you recognize the book
on my desk, Harry?"</p>
<p>The inner part of Harry was screaming and banging its head
against imaginary walls, while the outer Harry turned and stared at
what proved to be -</p>
<p>There was a rather long pause.</p>
<p>Then Harry said, "It is a copy of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>
by J. R. R. Tolkien."</p>
<p>"You recognized a quote from that book," said Dumbledore, an
intent look in his eyes, "so I assume you remember it well. If I am
mistaken, let me be corrected."</p>
<p>Harry just stared at him.</p>
<p>"It is important to understand," said Dumbledore, "that this
book is not a realistic depiction of a wizarding war. John Tolkien
never fought Voldemort. Your war will not be like the books you
have read. Real life is not like stories. Do you understand,
Harry?"</p>
<p>Harry, rather slowly, nodded yes; and then shook his head
no.</p>
<p>"In particular," said Dumbledore, "there is a certain very
foolish thing that Gandalf does in the first book. He makes many
mistakes, does Tolkien's wizard; but this one error is the most
unforgivable. That mistake is this: When Gandalf first suspected,
even for a moment, that Frodo held the One Ring, he should have
moved Frodo to Rivendell <em>at once.</em> He might have been
embarrassed, that old wizard, if his suspicions had proven false.
He might have found it awkward to so command Frodo, and Frodo would
have been greatly inconvenienced, needing to set aside many other
plans and pastimes. But a little embarrassment, and awkwardness,
and inconvenience, is as nothing compared to the loss of your whole
war, when the nine Nazgul swoop down on the Shire while you are
reading old scrolls in Minas Tirith, and take the Ring at once. And
it is not Frodo alone who would have been hurt; all Middle-Earth
would have fallen into slavery. If it had <em>not</em> been only a
story, Harry, they would have lost their war. Do you understand
what I am saying?"</p>
<p>"Er..." said Harry, "not exactly..." There was something about
Dumbledore when he was like this, which made it hard to stay
properly cold; his dark side had trouble with weird.</p>
<p>"Then I will spell it out," said the old wizard. His voice was
stern, his eyes were sad. "Frodo should have been moved to
Rivendell at once by Gandalf himself - and Frodo should never have
left Rivendell without guard. There should have been no night of
terror in Bree, no Barrow-downs, no Weathertop where Frodo was
wounded, they could have lost their entire war any of those times,
for Gandalf's folly! Do you understand now what I am saying to you,
son of Michael and Petunia?"</p>
<p>And the Harry who knew nothing did understand.</p>
<p>And the Harry who knew nothing saw that it was the smart, the
wise, the intelligent and sane, the <em>right</em> thing to do.</p>
<p>And the Harry who knew nothing said just what an innocent Harry
<em>would</em> have said, while the silent watcher screamed in
confusion and agony.</p>
<p>"You're saying," Harry said, his voice shaking as the emotions
inside burned through the outer calm, "that I'm not going home to
my parents for Easter."</p>
<p>"You <em>will</em> see them again," the old wizard said swiftly.
"I will beg them to come here to be with you, I will extend them
every courtesy during their visits. But you are not going home for
Easter, Harry. You are not going home for the summer. You are no
longer taking lunches in Diagon Alley, even with Professor Quirrell
to watch you. Your blood is the second requisite Voldemort needs to
rise as strong as before. So you are never again leaving the bounds
of Hogwarts's wards without a vital reason, and a guard strong
enough to fend off any attack for long enough to get you to safety.
"</p>
<p>Water was beginning at the corners of Harry's eyes. "Is that a
request?" said his quavering voice. "Or an order?"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Harry," the old wizard said softly. "Your parents
will see the necessity, I hope; but if not... I am afraid they have
no recourse; the law, however wrongly, does not recognize them as
your guardians. I am sorry, Harry, and I will understand if you
despise me for it, but it must be done."</p>
<p>Harry whirled, looked at the door, he couldn't look at
Dumbledore any more, couldn't trust his own face.</p>
<p><em>This is the cost to yourself,</em> said Hufflepuff within
his mind, <em>even as you imposed costs on others. Will that change
your whole view of the matter, the way Professor Quirrell thinks it
will?</em></p>
<p>Automatically, the mask of the innocent Harry said exactly what
it would have said: "Are my parents in danger? Do <em>they</em>
need to be moved here?"</p>
<p>"No," said the old wizard's voice. "I do not think so. The Death
Eaters learned, toward the end of the war, not to attack the
Order's families. And if Voldemort is now acting without his former
companions, he still knows that it is I who make the decisions for
now, and he knows that I would give him nothing for any threat to
your family. I have taught him that I do not give in to blackmail,
and so he will not try."</p>
<p>Harry turned back then, and saw a coldness on the old wizard's
face to match the shift in his voice, Dumbledore's blue eyes grown
hard as steel behind the glasses, it didn't match the person but it
matched the formal black robes.</p>
<p>"Is that everything, then?" said Harry's trembling voice. Later
he would think about this, later he would think of some cunning
countermeasure, later he would ask Professor Quirrell if there was
any way to convince the Headmaster he was mistaken. Right now,
maintaining the mask was taking all of Harry's attention.</p>
<p>"Voldemort used a Muggle artifact to escape Azkaban," the old
wizard said. "He is watching you and learning from you, Harry
Potter. Soon a man named Arthur Weasley at the Ministry will issue
an edict that all use of Muggle artifacts must cease in the Defense
Professor's battles. In the future, when you have a good idea, keep
it closer about yourself."</p>
<p>It didn't seem important by comparison. Harry just nodded, and
said again, "Is that everything?"</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>"Please," said the old wizard in a whisper. "I have no right to
ask your forgiveness, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, but please,
at least say that you understand why." There was water in the old
wizard's eyes.</p>
<p>"I understand," said the voice of the outer Harry who did
understand, "I mean... I was sort of thinking about it anyway...
wondering whether I could get you and my parents to let me stay
over at Hogwarts during the summer like the orphans, so I could
read the library here, it's just more interesting at Hogwarts
anyway..."</p>
<p>A choking sound came from Albus Dumbledore's throat.</p>
<p>Harry turned again toward the door. It wasn't escape unscathed,
but it was escape.</p>
<p>He took a step forward.</p>
<p>His hand reached to the door-handle.</p>
<p>A piercing cry split the air -</p>
<p>As though in slow motion, as Harry spun, he saw the phoenix
already launched through the air and winging toward him.</p>
<p>From the true Harry, the one who knew his own guilt, came a
flash of panic, he hadn't thought of that, hadn't anticipated it,
he'd prepared to face Dumbledore but he'd forgotten about
<em>Fawkes -</em></p>
<p>Flap, flap, and flap, three times the phoenix's wings flapped
like the flaring up and dying down of a fire, duration seemed to
pass too slowly as Fawkes soared over the mysterious devices toward
where Harry stood.</p>
<p>And the red-golden bird was hovering in front of him with gentle
wing-sweeps, bobbing in the air like a candle-flame.</p>
<p>"What is it, Fawkes?" said the false Harry in puzzlement,
looking the phoenix in the eyes, as he would if he were innocent.
The real Harry, feeling the same awful sickness inside as when
Professor McGonagall had expressed her trust in him, thought,
<em>Did I turn evil today, Fawkes? I didn't think I was evil... Do
you hate me now? If I've become something a phoenix hates, maybe I
should just give it up now, give up everything now and confess
-</em></p>
<p>Fawkes screamed, the most terrible cry Harry had ever heard, a
scream that set all the devices vibrating and made all the sleeping
figures start within their portraits.</p>
<p>It pierced through all of Harry's defenses like a white-hot
sword through butter, collapsed all his layers like a punctured
balloon popping, reshuffled his priorities in an instant as he
remembered the one most important thing; the tears began pouring
freely from Harry's eyes, down his cheeks, his voice choked as the
words came out of his throat like coughing up lava -</p>
<p>"Fawkes says," Harry's voice said, "he wants me, to do,
something, about, the prisoners, in Azkaban -"</p>
<p>"Fawkes, <em>no!</em> " said the old wizard. Dumbledore strode
forward, reaching out to the phoenix with a pleading hand. The old
wizard's voice was almost as desperate as the phoenix's scream had
been. "You cannot ask that of him, Fawkes, he's only a boy
still!"</p>
<p>"You went to Azkaban," Harry whispered, "you took Fawkes with
you, he saw - <em>you</em> saw - you were <em>there</em>, you saw -
<em>WHY DIDN'T YOU DO ANYTHING? WHY DIDN'T YOU LET THEM
OUT?</em> "</p>
<p>When the instruments stopped vibrating, Harry realized that
Fawkes had screamed at the same time as his own scream, that the
phoenix was now flying next to Harry and facing Dumbledore at his
side, the red-golden head level with his own.</p>
<p>"Can you," whispered the old wizard, "can you truly hear the
voice of the phoenix so clearly?"</p>
<p>Harry was sobbing almost too hard to speak, for all the metal
doors he'd passed, the voices he'd heard, the worst memories, the
desperate begging as he walked away, all of it had burst into his
mind like fire at the phoenix's scream, all the inner bulwarks
smashed. Harry didn't know whether he could truly hear the voice of
the phoenix so clearly, whether he would have understood Fawkes
without already knowing. All Harry knew was that he had a plausible
excuse to say the things Professor Quirrell had told him he must
<em>never</em> raise in conversation from this day forth; because
this was just what an innocent Harry would have said, would have
done, if he <em>had</em> heard so clearly. "They're hurting - we
have to help them -"</p>
<p>"I <em>can't!</em> " cried Albus Dumbledore. "Harry, Fawkes, I
<em>can't</em>, there's nothing I can do!"</p>
<p>Another piercing scream.</p>
<p>"<em>WHY NOT? JUST GO IN AND TAKE THEM OUT!"</em></p>
<p>The old wizard wrenched his gaze from the phoenix, his eyes
meeting Harry's instead. "Harry, tell Fawkes for me! Tell him it's
not that simple! Phoenixes aren't mere animals but they
<em>are</em> animals, Harry, they can't understand -"</p>
<p>"I don't understand either," Harry said, his voice trembling. "I
don't understand why you're <em>feeding people to Dementors!
Azkaban isn't a prison, it's a torture chamber and you're torturing
those people to DEATH!</em> "</p>
<p>"Percival," said the old wizard hoarsely, "Percival Dumbledore,
my own father, Harry, my own father died in Azkaban! I know, I know
it is a horror! <em>But what would you have of me?</em> To break
Azkaban by force? Would you have me declare open rebellion against
the Ministry?"</p>
<p>CAW!</p>
<p>There was a pause, and Harry's trembling voice said, "Fawkes
doesn't know anything about governments, he just wants you - to
take the prisoners out - of their cells - and he'll help you fight,
if anyone stands in your way - and - and so will I, Headmaster!
I'll go with you and destroy any Dementor that comes near! We'll
worry about the political fallout afterward, I bet that you and I
together could get away with it -"</p>
<p>"Harry," whispered the old wizard, "phoenixes do not understand
how winning a battle can lose a war." Tears were streaming down the
old wizard's cheeks, dripping into his silver beard. "The battle is
all they know. They are good, but not wise. That is why they choose
wizards to be their masters."</p>
<p>"Can you bring out the Dementors to where I can get at them?"
Harry's voice was begging, now. "Bring them out in groups of
fifteen - I think I could destroy that many at a time without
hurting myself -"</p>
<p>The old wizard shook his head. "It was hard enough to pass off
the loss of one - they might give me one more, but never two - they
are considered national possessions, Harry, weapons in case of war
-"</p>
<p>Fury blazed in Harry then, blazed up like fire, it might have
come from where a phoenix now rested on his own shoulder, and it
might have come from his own dark side, and the two angers mixed
within him, the cold and the hot, and it was a strange voice that
said from his throat, "Tell me something. What does a government
have to do, what do the voters have to do with their democracy,
what do the <em>people</em> of a <em>country</em> have to do,
before I ought to decide that I'm not on their side any more?"</p>
<p>The old wizard's eyes widened where he stared at the boy with a
phoenix upon his shoulder. "Harry... are those your words, or the
Defense Professor's -"</p>
<p>"Because there has to be <em>some</em> point, doesn't there? And
if it's not Azkaban, where is it, then?"</p>
<p>"Harry, listen, please, hear me! Wizards could not live together
if they each declared rebellion against the whole, every time they
differed! Always there will be <em>something</em> -"</p>
<p>"<em>Azkaban is not just something! It's evil!</em> "</p>
<p>"Yes, even evil! Even some evils, Harry, for wizards are not
perfectly good! And yet it is better that we live in peace, than in
chaos; and for you and I to break Azkaban by force would be the
beginning of <em>chaos</em>, can you not see it?" The old wizard's
voice was pleading. "And it is possible to oppose the will of your
fellows openly or in secret, without <em>hating</em> them, without
declaring them evil and enemy! I do not think the people of this
country deserve that of you, Harry! And even if some of them did -
what of the children, what of the students in Hogwarts, what of the
many good people mixed in with the bad?"</p>
<p>Harry looked on his shoulder at where Fawkes had perched, saw
the phoenix's eyes gazing back at him, they did not glow and yet
they blazed, red flames in a sea of golden fire.</p>
<p><em>What do you think, Fawkes?</em></p>
<p>"Caw?" said the phoenix.</p>
<p>Fawkes didn't understand the conversation.</p>
<p>The young boy looked at the old wizard, and said in a thick
voice, "Or maybe the phoenixes are wiser than us, smarter than us,
maybe they follow us around hoping that someday we'll
<em>listen</em> to them, someday we'll <em>get</em> it, someday
we'll just <em>take</em>, the prisoners, <em>out,</em> of their
<em>cells -</em>"</p>
<p>Harry spun and pulled open the oaken door and stepped onto the
staircase and slammed the door behind him.</p>
<p>The stairwell began rotating, Harry began descending, and he put
his face in his hands, and began to weep.</p>
<p>It wasn't until he was halfway to the bottom that he noticed the
difference, noticed the warmth still spreading through him, and
realized that -</p>
<p>"Fawkes?" Harry whispered.</p>
<p>- the phoenix was still on his shoulder, perched there as he had
seen him a few times upon Dumbledore's.</p>
<p>Harry looked again into the eyes, red flames in golden fire.</p>
<p>"You're not my phoenix now... are you?"</p>
<p>Caw!</p>
<p>"Oh," Harry said, his voice trembling a little, "I'm glad to
hear that, Fawkes, because I don't think - the Headmaster - I don't
think he deserves -"</p>
<p>Harry stopped, took a breath.</p>
<p>"I don't think he deserves that, Fawkes, he was trying to do the
right thing..."</p>
<p>Caw!</p>
<p>"But you're angry at him and trying to make a point. I
understand."</p>
<p>The phoenix nestled his head against Harry's shoulder, and the
stone gargoyle walked smoothly aside to let Harry pass back into
the corridors of Hogwarts.</p>

<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 59: TSPE, Curiosity, Pt
9<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>Broomsticks had been invented during what a Muggle would have
called the Dark Ages, supposedly by a legendary witch named
Celestria Relevo, allegedly the great-great-granddaughter of
Merlin.</p>
<p>Celestria Relevo, or whichever person or group had really
invented those enchantments, hadn't known a darned thing about
Newtonian mechanics.</p>
<p>Broomsticks, therefore, worked by Aristotelian physics.</p>
<p>They went where you pointed them.</p>
<p>If you wanted to move straight forward, you pointed them
straight forward; you didn't worry about keeping some of the thrust
going downward to cancel out the effect of gravity.</p>
<p>If you turned a broomstick, all of its new velocity was in the
new direction of pointing, it didn't go sideways based on its old
momentum.</p>
<p>Broomsticks had maximum speeds, not maximum accelerations. Not
because of anything to do with air resistance, but because a
broomstick had some maximum Aristotelian impetus its enchantments
could exert.</p>
<p>Harry had never explicitly <em>noticed</em> that before, despite
being dextrous enough to get the best grades in flying class.
Broomsticks worked so much like the human mind <em>instinctively
expected them to work</em> that his brain had managed to
<em>entirely overlook their physical absurdity.</em> Harry, on his
first Thursday of broomstick lessons, had been distracted by more
interesting-seeming phenomena, words written on paper and a glowing
red ball. So his brain had simply suspended its disbelief, marked
the reality of broomsticks as accepted, and proceeded to have its
fun, without ever once <em>thinking of the question</em> whose
answer would have been obvious. For it is a sad fact that we only
ever <em>think</em> about a tiny fraction of all the phenomena we
encounter...</p>
<p>That is the story of how Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres was
almost killed by his own lack of curiosity.</p>
<p>Because rockets did <em>not</em> work by Aristotelian
physics.</p>
<p>Rockets did <em>not</em> work like a human mind instinctively
thought a flying thing should work.</p>
<p>A rocket-assisted broomstick, therefore, did <em>not</em> move
like the magical broomsticks upon which Harry was such a very good
flyer.</p>
<p>None of this actually went through Harry's mind at the time.</p>
<p>For one thing, the loudest noise he'd ever heard in his life was
preventing him from hearing himself think.</p>
<p>For another thing, accelerating upward at four gravities meant
that he had around two and a half seconds, total, to go from the
bottom to the top of Azkaban.</p>
<p>And even if they were two and a half of the <em>longest</em>
seconds in the history of Time, that wasn't enough room to do much
thinking.</p>
<p>There was time only to see the lights of the Aurors' curses
arrowing down at him, slightly angle the broomstick to avoid them,
realize that the broomstick was simply continuing on with mostly
the same momentum instead of going in the direction he pointed it,
and activate the wordless concepts</p>
<p>*<em>crap*</em></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><em>*Newton*</em></p>
<p>whereupon Harry angled the broomstick much harder and then they
started to very quickly approach the wall so he angled it back the
other way and there were more lights coming down and the Dementors
were sliding smoothly up toward them along with some kind of giant
winged creature of white-golden flame so Harry wrenched the
broomstick back toward the sky but now he was still sliding toward
another wall so he tilted the broom slightly and he stopped
approaching but he was too close so he tilted it again and then the
distant Aurors on their broomsticks weren't very distant at all and
he was going to crash into that woman so he spun his broomstick
straight away from her and then in another instant he realized his
rocket was an extremely powerful flamethrower and in a fraction of
a second it would be pointing directly at the Auror so he spun the
broomstick sideways as he kept going up and he couldn't remember if
it was pointing at any Aurors now but at least it wasn't pointing
at <em>her</em></p>
<p>Harry missed another Auror by about a meter, zipping past him on
a sideways-pointed flamethrower moving upward at, Harry would later
guess, around 300 kilometers per hour.</p>
<p>If there were any screams of roasted Aurors he didn't hear them,
but this was not evidence one way or another, because all that
Harry was hearing at the moment was an extremely loud noise.</p>
<p>A couple of <em>calmer if not quieter</em> seconds later, there
didn't seem to be any Aurors around, or any Dementors, or any giant
winged flame creatures, and the vast and terrible edifice of
Azkaban looked surprisingly tiny from this height.</p>
<p>Harry got the broomstick pointed toward the Sun, faintly visible
through the clouds, it wasn't high in the sky at this time of day
and month of winter, and the broomstick accelerated for another two
seconds in that direction and picked up an amazing amount of speed
very quickly before the solid-fuel rocket burned itself out.</p>
<p>After that, once Harry could hear himself think again, when
there was only the howling wind from their ridiculous speed, and
Harry's enchantment-assisted fingers gripping the broomstick were
merely resisting the decelerating drag of moving way faster than
terminal velocity, <em>that</em> was when Harry actually thought
all that stuff about Newtonian mechanics and Aristotelian physics
and broomsticks and rocketry and the importance of curiosity and
how he was never going to do anything this Gryffindor ever again or
at least not until after he learned the Dark Lord's secret of
immortality and <em>why</em> had he listened to Professor Quirinus
"<em>I asssure you, boy, I would not attempt thisss if I did not
anticipate my own ssurvival</em> " Quirrell instead of Professor
Michael "Son, if you try anything to do with rockets on your own, I
mean <em>anything whatsoever</em> without a trained professonal
watching, you will die and that will make Mum sad"
Verres-Evans.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"<em>WHAT?</em> " shrieked Amelia at the mirror.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The wind had died down to a bearable level as the air resistance
slowed them, giving Harry plenty of opportunity to listen to the
buzzing, ringing sound that seemed to fill his whole brain.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell had been supposed to cast a Quieting Charm on
the rocket exhaust... apparently there were limits to what Quieting
Charms could do... in retrospect, Harry should have Transfigured a
pair of earplugs, not just trusted to the Quieting Charm, though
that probably wouldn't have been enough either...</p>
<p>Well, magical healing probably had something to treat permanent
hearing damage.</p>
<p>No, really, magical healing probably had something to treat
that. He'd seen students go to Madam Pomfrey with injuries that
sounded a lot worse...</p>
<p><em>Is there some way of transplanting an imaginary personality
to someone else's head?</em> asked Hufflepuff. <em>I don't want to
live in yours anymore.</em></p>
<p>Harry shoved it all into the back of his mind, there really
wasn't anything he could do about it right now. Was there anything
he <em>should</em> be worrying about -</p>
<p>Then Harry glanced behind him, remembering for the first time to
check whether Bellatrix or Professor Quirrell had been blown off
the broomstick.</p>
<p>But the green snake was still in its harness, and the emaciated
woman was still clinging to the broomstick, her face still charged
with unhealthy color and her eyes still bright and dangerous. Her
shoulders were shaking like she was laughing hysterically, and her
lips were moving as though to shout, but no sound was coming out
-</p>
<p>Oh, right.</p>
<p>Harry took off the hood of his cloak, tapped his ears to let her
know he couldn't hear.</p>
<p>Whereupon Bellatrix grasped her wand, pointed it at Harry, and
suddenly the ringing in his ears diminished, he could hear her.</p>
<p>A moment later he regretted it; the imprecations she was
screaming at Azkaban, Dementors, Aurors, Dumbledore, Lucius,
Bartemy Couch, something called the Order of the Phoenix, and all
who stood in the way of her Dark Lord, et cetera, were not suitable
for younger and more sensitive listeners; and her laughter was
hurting his newly healed ears.</p>
<p>"Enough, Bella," Harry finally said, and her voice stopped on
the instant.</p>
<p>There was a pause. Harry pulled the Cloak back over his head,
just on general principles; and realized in the same instant that
they might have telescopes down there or something, in retrospect
pulling down his hood for even a moment had been an incredibly dumb
move, he hoped the whole mission didn't end up failing because of
that one error...</p>
<p><em>We're not really cut out for this, are we?</em> observed
Slytherin.</p>
<p><em>Hey,</em> Hufflepuff objected in sheer reflex, <em>we can't
expect to do anything perfectly the first time, we probably just
need more practice FORGET I SAID THAT.</em></p>
<p>Harry looked back again, saw Bellatrix looking around with a
puzzled, wondering look on her face. Her head kept turning,
turning.</p>
<p>And finally Bellatrix said, her voice now lower, "My Lord, where
are we?"</p>
<p><em>What do you mean?</em> was what Harry wanted to say, but the
Dark Lord would never admit to not understanding anything, so Harry
replied, dryly, "We are on a broomstick."</p>
<p><em>Does she think she's dead, that this is Heaven?</em></p>
<p>Bellatrix's hands were still chained to the broomstick, so it
was only a finger that came up and pointed when she said, "What is
<em>that?</em> "</p>
<p>Harry followed the direction of her finger and saw... nothing in
particular, actually...</p>
<p>Then Harry realized. After they'd gone up high enough, there
hadn't been any clouds to obscure it any more.</p>
<p>"That is the Sun, dear Bella."</p>
<p>It came out remarkably controlled, the Dark Lord sounding
perfectly calm and maybe a little impatient with her, even as the
tears started down Harry's cheeks.</p>
<p>In the endless cold, in the pitch blackness, the Sun would
surely have been...</p>
<p>A happy memory...</p>
<p>Bellatrix's head kept turning.</p>
<p>"And the fluffy things?" she said.</p>
<p>"Clouds."</p>
<p>There was a pause, and then Bellatrix said, "But what
<em>are</em> they?"</p>
<p>Harry didn't answer her, there was no way his voice could have
been steady, would have been steady, it was all he could do to keep
his breathing perfectly regular while he cried.</p>
<p>After a while, Bellatrix breathed, so softly Harry almost didn't
hear, "Pretty..."</p>
<p>Her face slowly relaxed, the color leaving its paleness almost
as quickly as it had arrived.</p>
<p>Her skeletal body slumped down against the broomstick.</p>
<p>The borrowed wand dangled lifelessly from the strap attached to
her unmoving hand.</p>
<p><em>YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING -</em></p>
<p>Harry's mind remembered then, the Pepper-Up potion came at a
cost; Bellatrix would <em>ssleep for a conssiderable time,</em>
Professor Quirrell had said.</p>
<p>And in the same instant another part of Harry became utterly
convinced, looking back at the chalk-white emaciated woman, seeming
deader in the bright sunlight than anything Harry had ever seen
alive, that she <em>was</em> dead, that she had just uttered her
last word, that Professor Quirrell had misjudged the dosage -</p>
<p>- or deliberately sacrificed Bellatrix to guard their own escape
-</p>
<p><em>Is she breathing?</em></p>
<p>Harry couldn't see if she was breathing.</p>
<p>There was no way, on the broomstick, to reach back and take her
pulse.</p>
<p>Harry looked ahead to make sure they weren't about to run into
any flying rocks, kept on steering the broomstick toward the Sun,
the invisible boy and the possibly dead woman riding off into the
afternoon, while his fingers gripped the wood so hard they turned
white.</p>
<p>He couldn't reach back and perform artificial respiration.</p>
<p>He couldn't use anything from his healer's kit.</p>
<p><em>Trust Professor Quirrell to have not endangered
her?</em></p>
<p>Strange, it was strange, that even genuinely believing that
Professor Quirrell hadn't meant to kill the Auror (for it
<em>would</em> have been stupid), thinking of the Defense
Professor's reassurances no longer felt reassuring.</p>
<p>Then it occurred to Harry that he had yet to check -</p>
<p>Harry looked back, and hissed, "<em>Teacher?</em> "</p>
<p>The snake did not stir within its harness, and said no word.</p>
<p>...maybe the snake, not being an actual rider, hadn't been
protected from the acceleration. Or maybe coming that close to the
Dementors without a shield, even for a moment in Animagus form, had
knocked out the Defense Professor.</p>
<p>That wasn't good.</p>
<p>It was to have been Professor Quirrell who told Harry when it
was safe to use the portkey.</p>
<p>Harry steered the broomstick with whitened fingers, and thought,
he thought very hard for a small unmeasured length of time, during
which Bellatrix might or might not have been breathing, during
which Professor Quirrell himself might have already been
not-breathing for a while.</p>
<p>And Harry decided that while it was possible to recover from the
error of wasting the portkey in his possession, it was not possible
to recover from the error of letting a brain go too long without
oxygen.</p>
<p>So Harry took the next portkey in the sequence from his pouch,
as he slowed his broomstick to a halt in the bright blue air (Harry
didn't know, when he thought about it, whether a portkey's ability
to adjust for the Earth's rotation also included the ability to
match velocity in general with its new surroundings), touched the
portkey to the broomstick, and...</p>
<p>Harry paused, still holding the twig, the mate of the twig he
had snapped what seemed like two weeks ago. He was feeling a sudden
reluctance; his brain seemed to have learned the rule, by some
purely neural process of operant conditioning, that Snapping Twigs
Is A Bad Idea.</p>
<p>But that wasn't actually logical, so Harry snapped the twig
anyway.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>There was a thunderous boom from behind the nearby metal door,
causing Amelia to drop the mirror she was holding and spin around
with her wand in hand, and then that door burst open to reveal
Albus Dumbledore, standing there in front of a great smoking hole
in the prison wall.</p>
<p>"Amelia," said the old wizard. There was no trace of any of his
customary levity, his eyes were hard as sapphires beneath his
half-moon glasses. "I must leave Azkaban and I must do so
<em>now</em>. Is there any faster way than a broomstick to get
beyond the wards?"</p>
<p>"No -"</p>
<p>"Then I require your fastest broomstick, at once!"</p>
<p>The place where Amelia <em>wanted</em> to be was with the Auror
who had been injured by that Fiendfyre or whatever it had been.</p>
<p>What she <em>needed</em> to do was find out what Dumbledore
knew.</p>
<p>"You!" the old witch barked at the team around her. "Keep
clearing the corridors until you're at bottom, they may not all
have escaped yet!" And then, to the old wizard, "Two broomsticks.
You can brief me once we're in the air."</p>
<p>There was a match of stares, but not a long one.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>A sickeningly hard yank caught at Harry's abdomen, considerably
harder than the yank that had transported him to Azkaban, and this
time the distance traversed was great enough that he could hear an
instant of silence, watch the unseeable space between spaces, in
the crack between one place and another.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The Sun, which had shone on the two only briefly, was swiftly
occluded by a raincloud as they shot away from Azkaban, in the
direction of the wind and faster than the wind.</p>
<p>"Who's behind it?" shouted Amelia to the broomstick flying a
pace away from her.</p>
<p>"One of two people," Dumbledore said back, "I know not, at this
instant, who. If the first, then we are in trouble. If the second,
we are all in far greater trouble."</p>
<p>Amelia didn't spare any breath for sighs. "When will you
know?"</p>
<p>The old wizard's voice was grim, quiet and yet somehow rising
above the wind. "Three things they need for perfection, if it is
that one: The flesh of the Dark Lord's most faithful servant, the
blood of the Dark Lord's greatest foe, and access to a certain
grave. I had thought Harry Potter safe, with their attempt on
Azkaban all but failed - though I still set guards upon him - but
now I am fearful indeed. They have access to Time, someone with a
Time-Turner is sending messages for them; and I suspect the kidnap
attempt on Harry Potter has already taken place some hours ago.
Which is why <em>we</em> have not heard about it, being in Azkaban
where Time cannot knot itself. That past came after our own future,
you see."</p>
<p>"And if it is the other?" shouted Amelia. What she had heard
already was worrying enough; that sounded like the darkest of Dark
rituals, and centering on the dead Dark Lord himself.</p>
<p>The old wizard, his face now even grimmer, said nothing, only
shook his head.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>When the portkey's yank had subsided, the Sun was only just
peeking over the horizon, looking more like dawn than sunset, as
their broom hovered low above a brief expanse of dark-orange rock
and sand, arranged into lumpy hills like someone had kneaded the
land's dough a few times and then forgotten to roll it flat. In the
near distance, waves rolled past in an endless vista of water,
though the ground over which the broomstick hovered was above sea
level by meters at the least.</p>
<p>Harry blinked at the dawn colors, and then realized the portkey
had been international.</p>
<p>"Oy!" came a brisk, female shout from behind him, and Harry spun
the broomstick to look. A middle-aged lady was holding up one hand
to her mouth in a deliberate calling gesture, and bustling forward.
Her kindly features, narrow eyes, and umber skin marked a race
unfamiliar to Harry; she was clad in brilliant purple robes of a
style Harry had never seen before; and when her lips opened again
she spoke with an accent that Harry couldn't place, for he was not
widely traveled. "Where were you? You're two hours late! I almost
gave up on the lot of you... hello?"</p>
<p>There was a brief pause. Harry's thoughts seemed to be moving
oddly, too slow, everything felt distant, like there was a thick
pane of glass between himself and the world, and another thick pane
of glass between himself and his feelings, so that he could see,
but not touch. It had come over him upon seeing the dawn's light
and the kindly witch, and thinking that it all seemed like a proper
end to the adventure.</p>
<p>Then the witch was rushing forward and drawing her wand; a
muttered word severed the cuffs that bound the emaciated woman to
the broomstick, and Bellatrix was being floated down onto the sandy
rock with her skeletal arms and pale legs dangling like lifeless
things. "Oh, Merlin," whispered the witch, "Merlin, Merlin,
Merlin..."</p>
<p><em>She appears concerned,</em> thought an abstract, distant
thing between two panes of glass. <em>Is that what a real healer
would say, or is it what someone told to put on a performance would
say?</em></p>
<p>As though it wasn't Harry who spoke, but some other part of
himself behind yet another pane of glass, a whisper came from his
lips. "The green snake on her back is an Animagus." Not high the
whisper, not cold, only quiet. "He is unconscious."</p>
<p>The witch's head twitched up, to look at where that voice had
seemed to speak out of empty air, and then looked back down at
Bellatrix. "You're not Mister Jaffe."</p>
<p>"That would be the Animagus," whispered Harry's lips.
<em>Oh,</em> thought the Harry behind glass, listening to the sound
of his own lips, <em>that makes sense; Professor Quirrell must have
used a different name.</em></p>
<p>"Since when is <em>he</em> a - bah, forget it." The witch laid
her wand on the snake's nose for a moment, then shook her head
sharply. "Nothing wrong with him that a day's rest won't cure.
<em>Her...</em>"</p>
<p>"Can you wake him up now?" whispered Harry's lips. <em>Is that a
good idea?</em> thought Harry, but his lips definitely seemed to
think so.</p>
<p>Again the sharp headshake. "If an Innervate didn't work on him
-" began the witch.</p>
<p>"I did not attempt one," whispered Harry's lips.</p>
<p>"What? Why - oh, never mind. <em>Innervate.</em>"</p>
<p>There was a pause, and then a snake slowly crawled out of its
harness. Slowly the green head came up, looked around.</p>
<p>A blur later, Professor Quirrell was standing, and a moment
later had sagged to his knees.</p>
<p>"Lie down," said the witch without looking up from Bellatrix.
"That you in there, Jeremy?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said the Defense Professor rather hoarsely, as he
carefully laid himself down on a relatively flat patch of sandy
orange rock. He was not so pale as Bellatrix, but his face was
bloodless in the dim dawn light. "Salutations, Miss
Camblebunker."</p>
<p>"I told you," said the witch, sharpness in her voice and a
slight smile on her face, "call me Crystal, this isn't Britain and
we'll have none of your formality here. <em>And</em> it's Doctor
now, not Miss."</p>
<p>"My apologies, Doctor Camblebunker." This was followed by a dry
chuckle.</p>
<p>The witch's smile grew a little wider, her voice that much
sharper. "Who's your friend?"</p>
<p>"You don't need to know." The Defense Professor's eyes were
closed, where he lay on the ground.</p>
<p>"How wrong did it go?"</p>
<p>Very dryly indeed: "You can read about it tomorrow in any
newspaper with an international section."</p>
<p>The witch's wand was tapping here, there, poking and prodding
all over Bellatrix's body. "I missed you, Jeremy."</p>
<p>"Truly?" said the Defense Professor, sounding slightly
surprised.</p>
<p>"Not even a tiny little bit. If I didn't owe you -"</p>
<p>The Defense Professor started to laugh, and then it turned into
more of a coughing fit.</p>
<p><em>What do you think?</em> said Slytherin to the Inner Critic,
while Harry listened from behind the glass walls. <em>Performance,
or reality?</em></p>
<p><em>Can't tell,</em> said Harry's Inner Critic. <em>I'm not in
top critical form right now.</em></p>
<p><em>Can anyone think of a good probe to gather more
information?</em> said Ravenclaw.</p>
<p>Again that whisper from the empty air above the broomstick:
"What is the chance of undoing all that was done to her?"</p>
<p>"Oh, let's see. Legilimency and unknown Dark rituals, ten years
for that to set in place, followed by ten years of Dementor
exposure? Undo <em>that?</em> You're out of your skull, Mister
Whoever-You-Are. The question is whether there's anything
<em>left,</em> and I'd call that maybe one chance in three -" The
witch suddenly cut herself off. Her voice, when it spoke again, was
quieter. "If you were her friend, before... then no, you're never
getting her back. Best understand that now."</p>
<p><em>I'm voting that this is a performance,</em> said the Inner
Critic. <em>She wouldn't just blurt all that out in response to one
question unless she was looking for an opportunity.</em></p>
<p><em>Noted, but I'm putting a low weight of confidence on
that,</em> said Ravenclaw. <em>It's very hard not to let your
suspicions control your perceptions when you're trying to weigh
evidence that subtle.</em></p>
<p>"What potion did you give her?" the witch said after opening
Bellatrix's mouth and peering inside, her wand flashing multiple
colors of illumination.</p>
<p>The man lying on the ground calmly said, "Pepper-Up -"</p>
<p>"<em>Were you out of your mind?</em> "</p>
<p>Again the coughing laugh.</p>
<p>"She'll sleep for a week if she's lucky," the witch said, and
clucked her tongue. "I'll owl you when she opens her eyes, I
suppose, so you can come back and talk her into that Unbreakable
Vow. Have you got anything to stop her from killing me on the spot,
if she manages to even move for another month?"</p>
<p>The Defense Professor, eyes still closed, took a sheet of paper
from his robes; a moment later, words began to appear on it,
accompanied by tiny wisps of smoke. When the smoke had stopped
rising, the paper floated over toward the woman.</p>
<p>The woman looked over the paper with raised eyebrows, gave a
sardonic snort. "This had better work, Jeremy, or my last will and
testament says that my whole estate goes into putting a bounty on
your head. Speaking of which -"</p>
<p>The Defense Professor reached again into his robes and tossed
the witch a bag that made a clinking sound. The witch caught it,
weighed it, made a pleased sound.</p>
<p>Then she stood up, and the pale skeletal woman floated off the
ground beside her. "I'm heading back," said the witch. "I can't
start my work here."</p>
<p>"Wait," said the Defense Professor, and with a gesture retrieved
his wand from Bellatrix's hand and harness. Then his hand pointed
the wand at Bellatrix, and moved in a small circular gesture,
accompanied by a quiet, "<em>Obliviate</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>That's it</em>," snapped the witch, "I'm taking her out of
here before anyone does her any more damage -" One arm came around
to hug the bony form of Bellatrix Black to her side, and they both
disappeared with the loud POP! of Apparition.</p>
<p>And there was silence in that lumpy place, but for the gentle
rush of the passing waves, and a little breath of wind.</p>
<p><em>I think the performance is finished,</em> said the Inner
Critic. <em>I give it two and a half out of five stars. She's
probably not a very experienced actor.</em></p>
<p><em>I wonder if a real healer would seem more fake than an actor
told to play one?</em> mused Ravenclaw.<em><br></em></p>
<p>Like watching a television show, that was how it felt, like
watching a television show whose characters you didn't particularly
empathize with, that was all that could be seen and felt from
behind the glass walls.</p>
<p>Somehow, Harry managed to move his lips himself, send his own
voice out into the still dawn air, and then was surprised to hear
his own question. "How many different people are you, anyway?"</p>
<p>The pale man lying on the ground didn't laugh, but from the
broomstick Harry's eyes saw the sides of Professor Quirrell's lips
curling up, the edge of that familiar sardonic smile. "I cannot say
that I bothered keeping count. How many are you?"</p>
<p>It shouldn't have shaken the inner Harry so much, hearing that
response, and yet he felt - he felt - unstable, like his own center
had been subtracted -</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>"Excuse me," said Harry's voice. It now sounded as distant and
detached as the fading Harry felt. "I'm going to faint in a few
seconds, I think."</p>
<p>"Use the fourth portkey I gave you, the one I said was our
fallback refuge," said the man lying on the ground, calmly but
swiftly. "It will be safer there. And continue wearing your
cloak."</p>
<p>Harry's free hand retrieved another twig from his pouch and
snapped it.</p>
<p>There was another portkey yank, internationally long, and then
he was somewhere black.</p>
<p>"<em>Lumos</em>," said Harry's lips, some part of him looking
out for the safety of the whole.</p>
<p>He was inside what looked like a Muggle warehouse, a deserted
one.</p>
<p>Harry's legs climbed off the broomstick, lay on the floor. His
eyes closed, and some tidy fraction of self willed his light to
fail, before the darkness took him.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"Where will you go?" yelled Amelia. They were almost at the edge
of the wards.</p>
<p>"Backward in time to protect Harry Potter," said the old wizard,
and before Amelia could even open her lips to ask if he wanted
help, she felt the boundary of the wards as they crossed them.</p>
<p>There was a pop of Apparition, and the wizard and the phoenix
vanished, leaving behind the borrowed broomstick.</p>

<p>If you're five hours past your bedtime and still reading this,
may I suggest getting some sleep? The fic will still be here
tomorrow... unless, you know, something <em>bad</em> happens to it
and the next morning there's just a 404 at this address and you're
left with nothing but a fading memory and an eternal regret that
you didn't stay awake longer and keep reading while you still had
the chance... but hey, how probable is that?</p>
<p>This story spreads by blogging, tweeting, word of mouth,
favoriting, plugging on forums, and adding to lists; and remember,
if the readers before you hadn't taken a moment to do that, you
probably wouldn't have found this. If that's not enough to motivate
you, then let me add that if you don't help spread rationality,
Hermione will be sad. You don't want her to be sad, right?</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">LORD OF THE RATIONALITY</p>
<p>Frodo glanced at all the faces, but they were not turned to him.
All the Council sat with downcast eyes, as if in deep thought. A
great dread fell on him, as if he was awaiting the pronouncement of
some doom that he had long foreseen and vainly hoped might after
all never be spoken. An overwhelming longing to rest and remain at
peace by Bilbo's side in Rivendell filled all his heart. At last
with an effort he spoke, and wondered to hear his own words, as if
some other will was using his small voice.</p>
<p>"We cannot," said Frodo. "We must not. Do you not see? It is
exactly what the Enemy desires. All of this he has foreseen."</p>
<p>The faces turned to him, puzzled the Dwarves and grave the
Elves; sternness in the eyes of the Men; and so keen the gazes of
Elrond and of Gandalf that Frodo almost could not withstand it. It
was very hard, then, not to grasp the Ring in his hand, and harder
still not to put it on, to face them as only Frodo.</p>
<p>"Do you not question it?" Frodo said, thin like the wind his
voice, and wavering like a breeze. "You have chosen, of all things,
to send the Ring into Mordor; should you not wonder? How did it
come to this? That we might, of all our choices, do that single
thing our Enemy most desires? Perhaps the Cracks of Doom are
already guarded, strongly enough to hold off Gandalf and Elrond and
Glorfindel all together; or perhaps the Master of that place has
cooled the lava there, set it to trap the Ring so that he may
simply bring it out after it is thrown in..." A memory of awful
clarity came over Frodo then, and a flash of black laughter, and
the thought came to him that it was <em>just</em> what the Enemy
would do. Only the thought came to him so: <em>thus it would amuse
me to do, if I meant to rule...</em></p>
<p>There were doubtful glances exchanged within the council; Glóin
and Gimli and Boromir were now looking at the Elves more
skeptically than before, like they had awoken out of a dream of
words.</p>
<p>"The Enemy is very wise," said Gandalf, "and weighs all things
to a nicety in the scales of his malice. But the only measure that
he knows is desire, desire for power; and so he judges all hearts.
Into his heart the thought will not enter that any will refuse it,
that having the Ring we may seek to destroy it -"</p>
<p>"He <em>will</em> think of it!" cried Frodo. He struggled for
words, trying to convey things that had once seemed perfect in his
comprehension, and then faded like melting snow. "If the Enemy
thought that all his foes were moved by desire for power alone - he
would guess wrongly, over and over, and the Maker of this Ring
would <em>see</em> that, he would <em>know</em> that somewhere he
had made a mistake!" Frodo's hands stretched forth pleadingly.</p>
<p>Boromir stirred, and his voice was doubtful. "You speak fair of
the Enemy," said Boromir, "for one of his foes."</p>
<p>Frodo's mouth opened and shut in desperate bewilderment; for
Frodo knew, he knew the Man was mad, but he could think of nothing
to say.</p>
<p>Then Bilbo spoke, and his withered voice silenced the whole
room, even Elrond who had been about to speak. "Frodo is right, I
fear," whispered the old hobbit. "I remember, I remember what it
was like. To see with the Black Sight. I remember. The Enemy will
think that we might not trust one another, that the weaker among us
will propose to destroy the Ring so that the stronger may not have
it. He knows that even one not truly good might still cry to
destroy the Ring, to make a show of pretended goodness. And the
Enemy will <em>not</em> think it impossible that such a decision be
made by this council, for you see, he does not trust us to be
wise." A whispering chuckle rose from the ancient hobbit's throat.
"And if he did - why, he would <em>still</em> guard the Cracks of
Doom. It would cost him little."</p>
<p>Now foreboding was on the faces even of the Elves, and the Wise;
Elrond had frowned, and the sharp eyebrows of Gandalf furrowed.</p>
<p>Frodo gazed at them all, feeling a wildness come over him, a
despair; and as his heart weakened a shadow came over his vision, a
darkness and a wavering. From within the shadow Frodo saw Gandalf,
and the wizard's strength was revealed as weakness, and his wisdom
folly. For Frodo knew, as the Ring seemed to drag and weigh on his
breast, that Gandalf had not thought at all of history and lore,
when the wizard spoke of how the Enemy would not understand any
desire save power; that Gandalf had not remembered how Sauron had
cast down and corrupted the Men of Númenor in the days of their
glory. Just as it had not occurred to Gandalf that the Enemy might
learn to comprehend foes of goodwill by <em>looking...</em></p>
<p>Frodo's gaze swung to Elrond, but there was no hope there, no
answer and no rescue in the shadowy vision; for Elrond had let
Isildur go, carrying the Ring from the Cracks of Doom where it
should have been destroyed, to the cost of all this war. Not for
Isildur's own sake, not for friendship had it been done, for the
Ring had killed Isildur in the end, and far worse fates could have
followed him. But the Doom that had stemmed from Isildur's deed
would have seemed unsure to Elrond then, unsure and distant in
time; and yet the cost to Elrond himself of taking his sword's
pommel to the back of Isildur's head would have been surer, and
nearer...</p>
<p>As though in desperation, Frodo turned to look at Aragorn, the
weathered man who had donned his travel-worn clothes for this
council, the heir of kings who spoke softly to hobbits. But Frodo's
vision seemed to double, and in the shadowy second image Frodo saw
a Man who had spent too much of his youth among Elves, who had
learned to wear humble and stained clothes amid the gold and
jewels, knowing he could not match them wisdom for wisdom, and
hoping to outplay them in a fashion they would not emulate...</p>
<p>In the sight of the Ring, which was the sight of the Ring's own
Maker, all noble things faded into stratagems and lies, a world of
grey and darkness without any light. They had not made their
choices knowingly, Gandalf or Elrond or Aragorn; the impulses had
come from the dark hidden parts of themselves, the black secret
depths which the Ring had rendered plain in Frodo's vision. Would
they outthink the Shadow, when they could not comprehend even their
own selves, or the forces that moved them?</p>
<p>"Frodo!" came the sharp whisper of Bilbo's voice, and Frodo came
to himself, and halted his hand reaching up toward where the Ring
lay on his breast, on its chain, dragging like a vast stone around
his neck.</p>
<p>Reaching up to grasp the Ring wherein all answers lay.</p>
<p>"How did you bear this thing?" Frodo whispered to Bilbo, as if
the two of them were the only souls in the room, though all the
Council watched them. "For years? I cannot imagine it."</p>
<p>"I kept it locked in a room to which only Gandalf had the key,"
said his uncle, "and when I began to imagine ways to open it, I
remembered Gollum."</p>
<p>A shudder went through Frodo, remembering the tales. The horror
of the Misty Mountains, thinking, always thinking in the dark;
ruling the goblins from the shadows and filling the tunnels with
traps; but for Bilbo wearing the ring that first time not a single
dwarf would have lived. And now, Legolas the Elf had told them,
Gollum had given up on sending his agents against the Shire, had at
last found the courage to leave his mountains and seek the Ring
himself. That was Gollum, the fate which Frodo would share himself,
if the Ring were not destroyed.</p>
<p>Only they had no way to destroy the Ring.</p>
<p>The Shadow had foreseen every move they could make. Had
<em>almost</em> - Frodo still could not imagine how it had been
done, how the Shadow had arranged such a thing - had
<em>almost</em> maneuvered the Council into sending the Ring
straight into Mordor with only a tiny guard set on it, as they
would have done if Frodo and Bilbo had not been there.</p>
<p>And having foregone that swiftest of all possible defeats, the
only question remaining was how long it would take to lose. Gandalf
had delayed too long, delayed far too long to set this march in
motion. It could have been so easy, if only Bilbo had set out
eighty years earlier, if only Bilbo had been told what Gandalf had
already suspected, if only Gandalf's heart had not silently
flinched away from the prospect of being embarrassingly
wrong...</p>
<p>Frodo's hand spasmed on his breast; without thought, his fingers
began to rise again toward the vast weight of the chain on which
the Ring hung.</p>
<p>All he had to do was put on the Ring.</p>
<p>Just that, and all would become clear to him, once more the
slowness and mud would leave his thoughts, all possibilities and
futures transparent to him, he would see through the Shadow's plans
and devise an irresistible counterstroke -</p>
<p>- and he would never be able to take off the Ring, not again,
not by any will that would be left to him. All Frodo had of those
moments were fading memories, but he knew that it had felt like
dying, to let all his towers of thought collapse and become only
Frodo once more. It had felt like dying, he remembered that much of
Weathertop even if he remembered little else. And if he did wear
the Ring again, it would be better to die with it on his finger, to
end his life while he was still himself; for Frodo knew that he
could not withstand the effects of wearing the Ring a second time,
not afterward when the limitless clarity was lost to him...</p>
<p>Frodo looked around the Council, at the poor lost leaderless
Wise, and he knew they could not defeat the Shadow by their own
strength.</p>
<p>"I will wear it one last time," Frodo said, his voice broken and
failing, as he had known from the beginning that he would say in
the end, "one last time to find the answer for this Council, and
then there will be other hobbits."</p>
<p>"<em>No!</em> " screamed the voice of Sam, as the other hobbit
began to rush forward from where he had hidden; even as Frodo, with
movement as swift and precise as a Nazgûl, took out the Ring from
beneath his shirt; and somehow Bilbo was already standing there and
had already thrust his finger through.</p>
<p>It all happened before even Gandalf's staff could point, before
Aragorn could level the hilt-shard of his sword; the Dwarves
shouted in shock, and the Elves were dismayed.</p>
<p>"Of course," said Bilbo's voice, as Frodo began to weep, "I see
it now, I understand everything at last. Listen, listen and
swiftly, here is what you must do -"</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE</p>
<p>With a critical eye, Peter looked over the encamped Centaurs
with their bows, Beavers with their long daggers, and talking Bears
with their chain-mail draped over them. He was in charge, because
he was one of the mythical Sons of Adam and had declared himself
High King of Narnia; but the truth was he didn't really know much
about encampments, weapons, and guard patrols. In the end all he
could see was that they all looked proud and confident, and Peter
had to hope they were right about that; because if you couldn't
believe in your own people, you couldn't believe in anyone.</p>
<p>"They'd scare <em>me</em>, if I had to fight 'em," Peter said
finally, "but I don't know if it's enough to beat...
<em>her.</em>"</p>
<p>"You don't suppose this mysterious lion will actually show up
and help us, d'you?" said Lucy. Her voice was very quiet, so that
none of the creatures around them would hear. "Only it'd be nice to
really have him, don't you think, instead of just letting people
think that he put us in charge?"</p>
<p>Susan shook her head, shaking the magical arrows in the quiver
on her back. "If there was really someone like that," Susan said,
"he wouldn't have let the White Witch cover the land in winter for
a hundred years, would he?"</p>
<p>"I had the strangest dream," Lucy said, her voice even quieter,
"where we didn't have to organize any creatures or convince them to
fight, we just walked into this place and the lion was already
here, with all the armies already mustered, and he went and rescued
Edmund, and then we rode alongside him into this tremendous battle
where he killed the White Witch..."</p>
<p>"Did the dream have a moral?" said Peter.</p>
<p>"I don't know," said Lucy, blinking and looking a little
puzzled. "In the dream it all seemed pointless somehow."</p>
<p>"I think maybe the land of Narnia was trying to tell you," said
Susan, "or maybe it was just your own dreams trying to tell you,
that if there was really such a person as that lion, there'd be no
use for <em>us</em>."</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">MY LITTLE PONY: FRIENDSHIP IS
SCIENCE</p>
<p>"Applejack, who told me outright that I was mistaken, represents
the spirit of... <em>honesty!</em> " Twilight Sparkle raised her
head even higher, mane blowing like a wind about the dusky sky of
her neck. "Fluttershy, who approached the manticore to find out
about the thorn in its paw, represents the spirit of...
<em>investigation!</em> Pinkie Pie, who realized that the awful
faces were just trees, represents the spirit of... <em>formulating

made us convince her that we were right before she agreed to come
on our expedition, represents the spirit of... <em>peer
review!</em> And when those Elements are ignited by the spark of
curiosity that resides in the heart of all of us, it creates the
seventh element - the Element of Sci-"</p>
<p>The blast of power that came forth was like a wind of moonless
night, it caught Marie-Susan before the pony could even flinch, and
she was gone without a trace before any of them had the chance to
rear in shock.</p>
<p>From the dark thing that stood in the center of the dais where
the Elements had shattered, from the scarce-recognizable void-black
outline of a horse, came a voice that seemed to bypass all ears and
burn like cold fire, sounding directly in the brain of everypony
who heard:</p>
<p><em>Did you expect me to just stand there and let you
finish?</em></p>
<p>Twilight Sparkle stared at the space where Marie-Susan had been,
where not a trace of the unicorn remained. <em>She - she just - she
-</em> In the back of her mind, unheard, she was aware that Rarity
was screaming.</p>
<p><em>That wasn't a disintegration,</em> said the voice of
Nightmare. <em>I sent her somewhere else.</em></p>
<p>Rarity's scream stopped abruptly.</p>
<p>Twilight Sparkle felt like her own scream was only beginning.
Seven. It took seven ponies to use the Elements of Inquiry.
Everyone knew that no matter how honest, investigating, skeptical,
creative, analytic, or curious you were, what really made your work
Science was when you published your results in a prestigious
journal. Everyone knew that. Could there be more than one Element
of Peer Review at a time - how long would it take to find another
one - and the Nightmare wouldn't just stand there and let them do
it -</p>
<p>"Where?" yelled Rainbow Dash. "Where'd you put her?"</p>
<p><em>I put the little pony in the same place I bound my pathetic
sister, in the heart of her pathetic Sun.</em></p>
<p>"She'll die!" cried Fluttershy, staring at the Nightmare in
horror. "It's too hot, she'll burn!"</p>
<p><em>Oh, don't worry. The power of the Nightmare surrounds your
little friend, keeping her safe and cool, sustaining her without
food or drink. She will suffer nothing more than
boredom...</em></p>
<p>The void-black outline stepped off the dais, walking slowly,
deliberately, past the remaining six ponies.</p>
<p><em>...so long as the Nightmare's power is not broken. By any
backup plans my sister may have set in motion, for example, and
which may be known to you. In that case she will vaporize
instantly. Such a lovely thing, friendship. It makes such a
wonderful instrument of blackmail. Be sure to keep safe the
Elements of Inquiry. You wouldn't want anyone else using them on
me, now would you?</em></p>
<p>"No," whispered Twilight Sparkle, as the horror began to dawn on
her.</p>
<p>Then a crawling sensation all over her skin, as the Nightmare
walked past her, and the deadly power brushed her with its cold
caress.</p>
<p><em>Now if you'll pardon me, my little ponies, I have an eternal
night to rule over.</em></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">THE VILLAGE HIDDEN IN THE CLARITY</p>
<p>"Consider the computational power required to manifest over a
hundred shadow clones," the Uchiha genius said in his dispassionate
tones. "It is an error of rationality, Sakura, to say 'fluke' and
think you have explained anything. 'Fluke' is simply the name one
gives to data that one is ignoring."</p>
<p>"But it <em>has</em> to be a fluke!" Sakura yelled. With effort,
she calmed her voice into the careful precision expected of a
rationality ninja; it wouldn't do to have her crush think she was
stupid. "Like you said, the computational power required to use
over a hundred Kage Bunshin is simply absurd. We're talking the
level of a major superintelligence. Naruto's the dead last of our
class. He's not even jounin-level smart, let alone a
superintelligence!"</p>
<p>The Uchiha's eyes gleamed, almost as though he had activated his
Smartingan. "Naruto can manifest a hundred independently acting
clones. He <em>must</em> have the raw brainpower. But, under
ordinary circumstances, something prevents him from using this
computational power efficiently... like a mind at war within
itself, perhaps? We now have cause to believe that Naruto is in
some way connected to a superintelligence, and as a recently
graduated genin, he, like us, is fifteen years old. What happened
fifteen years ago, Sakura?"</p>
<p>It took a moment for Sakura to comprehend, to remember, and then
she understood.</p>
<p>The attack of the Nine-Brains Demon Fox.</p>
<p>Just a small bone-white creature with big ears and bigger tail
and beady red eyes. It was no stronger than an ordinary fox, it
didn't breathe fire or flash laser eyes, it possessed no chakra and
no magic of any kind, but its intelligence was over nine thousand
times that of a human being.</p>
<p>Hundreds had been killed, half the buildings wrecked, almost the
whole village of Beisugakure had been destroyed.</p>
<p>"You think the Kyubey is hiding inside Naruto?" Sakura said. A
moment later, her brain automatically went on to fill in the
obvious implications of the theory. "And the software conflict
between their existences is why he acts like a gibbering idiot half
the time, but can control a hundred Kage Bunshin. Huh. That
makes... a lot of sense... actually..."</p>
<p>Sasuke gave her the brief, contemptuous nod of someone who had
figured all this out on his own, without anyone else needing to
prompt <em>him</em>.</p>
<p>"Ano..." said Sakura. Only years of sanity exercises channeled
her complete screaming panic into pragmatically useful policy
options. "Shouldn't we... <em>tell</em> someone about this? Like,
sometime in the next five seconds?"</p>
<p>"The adults already know," Sasuke said emotionlessly. "It is the
obvious explanation for their treatment of Naruto. No, the real
question is how this fits into the outwitting of the Uchiha..."</p>
<p>"I don't see how it fits at all -" began Sakura.</p>
<p>"It <em>must</em> fit!" A tinge of frantic emotion flickered in
Sasuke's voice. "I asked that man <em>why</em> he did it, and he
told me that when I knew the answer to that, it would explain
<em>everything!</em> Surely <em>this</em> must also be part of what
is to be explained!"</p>
<p>Sakura sighed to herself. Her personal hypothesis was that
Itachi had just been trying to drive his brother into clinical
paranoia.</p>
<p>"Yo, kids," said the voice of their rationality sensei from
their radio earpieces. "There's a village in Wave trying to build a
bridge, and it keeps falling down for no reason anyone can figure
out. Meet up at the gates at noon. It's time for your first
C-ranked analysis mission."</p>

<p>"But you wanted to," said Richard.</p>
<p>I didn't say anything, but I knew that the look on my face said

<p>Ghost<br>
Mark me.</p>
<p>HAMLET<br>
Father, I will.</p>
<p>Ghost<br>
My hour is almost come,<br>
When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames<br>
Must render up myself.</p>
<p>HAMLET<br>
Thou art in torment?</p>
<p>Ghost<br>
Ay, as are all who die unshriven.</p>
<p>HAMLET<br>
Like every Dane this is what I've been taught.<br>
Yet I did figure such caprice ill-suited to almighty God.<br>
For all who suffer unlook'd for deaths, unattended by God's chosen
priests,<br>
to be then punish'd for the ill-ordering of the world...</p>
<p>Ghost<br>
'twas not the world that killed me, nor accident of any kind.</p>
<p>HAMLET<br>
What?</p>
<p>Ghost<br>
If thou didst ever thy dear father love,<br>
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.</p>
<p>HAMLET<br>
Oh God.</p>
<p>Ghost<br>
My time grows ever shorter. Wilt thou hear the tale?</p>
<p>HAMLET<br>
No.</p>
<p>Ghost<br>
What?</p>
<p>HAMLET<br>
My love for you does call me to avenge your death,<br>
but greater crimes have I heard told this night.<br>
If all those murdered go to Hell, and others as well,<br>
who would have confess'd had they the time,<br>
If people who are, in balance, good, suffer grisly<br>
at the hands of God, then I defy God's plan.</p>
<p>Good Ghost, as one who dwells beyond the veil,<br>
you know things that we mortals scarce conceive.<br>
Tell me: is there some philter or device,<br>
outside nature's ken but not outside her means,<br>
by which death itself may be escap'd?</p>
<p>Ghost<br>
You seek to evade Hell?</p>
<p>HAMLET<br>
I seek to deny Hell to everyone!<br>
and Heaven too, for I suspect the Heaven of our mad God<br>
might be a paltry thing, next to the Heaven I will make of
Earth,<br>
when I am its immortal king.</p>
<p>Ghost<br>
I care not for these things.<br>
Death and hell have stripp'd away all of my desires,<br>
save for revenge upon my murderer.</p>
<p>HAMLET<br>
Thou shalt not be avenged, save that thou swear:<br>
an I slay thine killer, so wilt thou vouchsafe to me the
means<br>
by which I might slay death.</p>
<p>He who killed you will join you in the Pit,<br>
and then that's it. No further swelling of Hell's ranks will I
permit.</p>
<p>Ghost<br>
Done. When my brother is slain, he who poured the poison in my
ear,<br>
then will I pour in yours the precious truth:<br>
the making of the Philosopher's Stone. With this Stone, thou may'st
procure<br>
a philter to render any man immune to death, and more
transmute<br>
base metal to gold, to fund the provision of this philter to all
mankind.</p>
<p>HAMLET<br>
Truly there is nothing beyond the dreaming of philosophy.<br>
Wait.<br>
The man whom I must kill-my uncle the king?</p>
<p>Ghost<br>
Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,<br>
With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-</p>
<p>HAMLET<br>
Indeed, he has such gifts I near despair,<br>
of killing him and yet succeeding to his throne.<br>
'twill be an awesome fight for awesome stakes.<br>
Hast thou advice?</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">ALICE IN THE LAND WHERE THINGS ARE
EVEN CRAZIER THAN HERE</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(as first written by
<strong>braindoll</strong> in a review of this chapter, with some
further edits)</p>
<p>Alice was sitting by her sister on the bank, reading a book. She
had several friends who were older, and if she just asked nicely,
they were often happy to lend her books without <em>quite</em> so
many pictures and conversations as was thought appropriate for a
girl her age.</p>
<p>Hot days often made her feel sleepy and stupid, so Alice had
thoughtfully wet a handkerchief and placed it at the back of her
neck. Still her mind had gone off wandering (just as if it was some
little kitten whose owner had taken off her eyes for just a
moment), and she had just decided that the pleasure of making a
daisy-chain would be worth around 4/3 of the trouble of getting up
and picking the daisies, which was nonetheless not equal to the
opportunity cost of putting down her book, when suddenly a White
Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p>
<p>There was nothing so <em>very</em> remarkable in that; nor, in
fact, did Alice think it so <em>very</em> much out of the way to
hear the Rabbit say to itself, "Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!"
But when the Rabbit actually <em>took a watch out of its waistcoat-
pocket,</em> and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice froze in
sudden clarity and fear, for she had never before seen a rabbit
with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it. "Oh
bother," she said to herself (though not aloud; she had long since
cured herself of that habit, as it made people take her even less
seriously than they already did). "If I did not immediately
recognize how much curiouser that was than the average rabbit, then
something is interfering with my curiosity, and that is most
curious of all." So, burning with questions, she ran across the
field after it, and was just in time to see it pop down a large
rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p>

<p>Hermione Granger had read somewhere once, that one of the keys
to staying thin was to pay attention to the food you ate, to notice
yourself eating it, so that you were satisfied with the meal. This
morning she'd made herself toast, and put butter on the toast, and
cinnamon on the butter, and it really should've been enough to get
her to <em>notice,</em> this time, the goodness that was in front
of her...</p>
<p>Without noticing the cinnamon or the butter, without noticing
the food or that she was eating, Hermione swallowed another bite of
toast, and said, "Can you try explaining that again? I'm still
completely flabbergasted."</p>
<p>"It's pretty straightforward, if you think like a Light-Side
Slytherin," said the boy that everyone else in school, excepting
only the two of them, now believed to be her true love. Harry
Potter's spoon absentmindedly stirred his breakfast cereal; he
hadn't taken many bites of it this morning, not that Hermione had
seen. "Every good thing in the world brings its own opposition into
existence. Phoenixes are no exception."</p>
<p>Hermione took another unnoticed bite out of her buttered and
cinnamoned toast, and said, "How can anyone <em>not understand</em>
that Fawkes thinks you're a good enough person to ride around on
your shoulder? He wouldn't do that with a Dark Wizard! He just
wouldn't!"</p>
<p>And she hadn't yelled at anyone about Fawkes's touch on her
<em>own</em> cheek, because she knew it wouldn't be right - that if
a phoenix touched you, you weren't supposed to brag about it, that
wasn't what a phoenix was <em>for</em>.</p>
<p>But she'd really <em>hoped</em> that it would squash the rumors
about Harry Potter going evil and Hermione Granger following him
down.</p>
<p>And it hadn't.</p>
<p>And she truly couldn't understand why not.</p>
<p>Harry ate another bite of his cereal, his eyes going distant
now, no longer meeting her own. "Think of it this way: You skip
school one day, and you lie and tell your teacher you were sick.
The teacher tells you to bring a doctor's note, so you forge one.
The teacher says she's going to call the doctor to check, so you
have to give her a fake number for the doctor, and get a friend to
pretend to be the doctor when she calls -"</p>
<p>"You did <em>what?</em> "</p>
<p>Harry looked up from his cereal then, and now he was smiling.
"I'm not saying I really <em>did</em> that, Hermione..." Then his
eyes abruptly dropped back down to his cereal. "No. Just an
example. Lies propagate, that's what I'm saying. You've got to tell
more lies to cover them up, lie about every fact that's connected
to the first lie. And if you <em>kept on</em> lying, and you
<em>kept on</em> trying to cover it up, sooner or later you'd even
have to start lying about the general laws of thought. Like,
someone is selling you some kind of alternative medicine that
doesn't work, and any double-blind experimental study will confirm
that it doesn't work. So if someone wants to <em>go on</em>
defending the lie, they've got to get you to disbelieve in the
experimental method. Like, the experimental method is just for
merely <em>scientific</em> kinds of medicine, not amazing
alternative medicine like theirs. Or a good and virtuous person
should believe as strongly as they can, no matter what the evidence
says. Or truth doesn't exist and there's no such thing as objective
reality. A lot of common wisdom like that isn't just
<em>mistaken,</em> it's anti-epistemology, it's
<em>systematically</em> wrong. Every rule of rationality that tells
you how to find the truth, there's someone out there who needs you
to believe the opposite. If you once tell a lie, the truth is ever
after your enemy; and there's a lot of people out there telling
lies -" Harry's voice stopped.</p>
<p>"What does that have to do with Fawkes?" she said.</p>
<p>Harry withdrew his spoon from his cereal, and pointed in the
direction of the Head Table. "The Headmaster has a phoenix, right?
And he's Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot? So he's got political
opponents, like Lucius. Now, d'you think that opposition is going
to just roll over and surrender, because Dumbledore has a phoenix
and they don't? Do you think they'll admit that Fawkes is even
<em>evidence</em> that Dumbledore's a good person? Of course not.
They've got to invent <em>something</em> to say that makes
Fawkes... <em>not important.</em> Like, phoenixes only follow
people who charge straight at anyone they think is evil, so having
a phoenix just means you're an idiot or a dangerous fanatic. Or,
phoenixes just follow people who are pure Gryffindor, so Gryffindor
they don't have the virtues of other Houses. Or it just shows how
much courage a magical animal thinks you have, nothing else, and it
wouldn't be fair to judge politicians based on that. They have to
say <em>something</em> to deny the phoenix. I bet Lucius didn't
even have to make up anything new. I bet it had all been said
before, centuries ago, since the first time someone had a phoenix
riding on his shoulder, and someone else wanted people not to take
that into account as evidence. I bet by the time Fawkes came along
it was already common wisdom, it would have just seemed
<em>strange</em> to take into account who a phoenix liked or
disliked. It would be like a Muggle newspaper testing political
candidates to rate their level of scientific literacy. Every force
for Good that exists in this universe, there's someone else who
benefits from people discounting it, or fencing it into a narrow
box where it can't get to them."</p>
<p>"But -" Hermione said. "Okay, I see why Lucius Malfoy doesn't
want anyone to think that Fawkes matters, but why does anyone who
<em>isn't</em> a bad guy <em>believe</em> it?"</p>
<p>Harry Potter gave a little shrug. His spoon dropped back into
his cereal, and went on stirring without a pause. "Why does any
kind of cynicism appeal to people? Because it seems like a mark of
maturity, of sophistication, like you've seen everything and know
better. Or because putting something down feels like pushing
yourself up. Or they don't have a phoenix themselves, so their
political instinct tells them there's no advantage to be gained
from saying nice things about phoenixes. Or because being cynical
feels like knowing a secret truth that common people don't know..."
Harry Potter looked in the direction of the Head Table, and his
voice dropped until it was almost a whisper. "I think maybe that's
what <em>he's</em> getting wrong - that he's cynical about
everything else, but not about cynicism itself."</p>
<p>Without thinking, Hermione looked in the direction of the Head
Table herself, but the Defense Professor's seat was still empty, as
it had been on Monday and Tuesday; the Deputy Headmistress had
pronounced, earlier, that Professor Quirrell's classes for today
would be canceled.</p>
<p>Afterward, when Harry had eaten a few bites of treacle tart and
then left the table, Hermione looked at Anthony and Padma, who had
been coincidentally eating nearby but certainly not eavesdropping
or anything.</p>
<p>Anthony and Padma looked back at her.</p>
<p>Padma said hesitantly, "Is it just me, or has Harry Potter
started talking like a more <em>complicated</em> sort of book in
the last few days? I mean, I haven't been listening to him very
long -"</p>
<p>"It's not just you," said Anthony.</p>
<p>Hermione didn't say anything, but she was becoming increasingly
worried. Whatever had happened to Harry Potter on the day of the
phoenix, it had changed him; there was something new in him now.
Not cold, but <em>hard.</em> Sometimes she caught him staring out a
window at nothing visible, a look of grim determination on his
face. In Herbology class on Monday, a Venus Fire Trap had gone out
of control; and Harry had tackled Terry out of the way of a
fireball even as Professor Sprout had shouted a Flame-Freezing
Charm; and when Harry had risen from the floor he'd just gone back
to his place like nothing interesting had happened. And when for
once she'd gotten a better test score than Harry in their
Transfiguration exam, later that same Monday, Harry had smiled at
her as though to congratulate her, instead of gritting his teeth;
and... that had bothered her <em>a lot</em>.</p>
<p>She was getting the sense that Harry...</p>
<p>...was pulling away from her...</p>
<p>"He seems a lot <em>older</em> all of a sudden," said Anthony.
"Not like a real grownup, I can't imagine <em>Harry</em> as a
grownup, but it's like he suddenly turned into a <em>fourth-year
version</em> of... of <em>whatever</em> he is."</p>
<p>"Well," Padma said. She daintily dabbed a chocolate-flavored
scone with some scone-flavored frosting. "I think Dragon and
Sunshine had better ally during the next battle or Mr. Harry Potter
is going to <em>smash</em> us. We were allied last time, and even
then Chaos almost won -"</p>
<p>"Yeah," said Anthony. "You're right, Miss Patil. Tell the Dragon
General that we want to meet with you -"</p>
<p>"No!" said Hermione. "We shouldn't <em>have</em> to gang up on
General Potter just to stand a chance. That doesn't make sense,
especially now that nobody can use Muggle things anymore. It's
still twenty-four soldiers in every army."</p>
<p>Neither Padma or Anthony said anything to that.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Knock-knock, knock-knock.</p>
<p>"Come in, Mr. Potter," she said.</p>
<p>The door creaked open, and Harry Potter slipped through the
opening into her office; he pushed the door shut behind him with
one hand, and wordlessly seated himself in the cushioned chair that
now stood in front of her desk. She'd Transfigured that chair so
often that it sometimes changed form to reflect her mood, without
any wand movement or incantation or even conscious intent. Right
now, that chair had become deeply cushioned, so that as Harry sat
down he sank into it, as though the chair were hugging him.</p>
<p>Harry didn't seem to notice. There was an air of quiet
determination about the boy; his eyes had locked steadily with
hers, and not let up for a moment. "You called me?" said the
boy.</p>
<p>"I did," said Professor McGonagall. "I have two pieces of good
news for you, Mr. Potter. First - have you met Mr. Rubeus Hagrid,
at all? The groundskeeper? He was an old friend of your
parents."</p>
<p>Harry hesitated. Then, "Mr. Hagrid spoke to me a bit after I got
here," Harry said. "I think it was on Tuesday of my first week of
school. He didn't say he knew my parents, though. At the time I
thought he just wanted to introduce himself to the Boy-Who-Lived...
did he have some kind of hidden agenda? He didn't <em>seem</em>
like the type..."</p>
<p>"Ah..." she said. It took her a moment to pull her thoughts
together. "It's a long story, Mr. Potter, but Mr. Hagrid was
falsely accused of murdering a student, five decades ago. Mr.
Hagrid's wand was snapped, and he was expelled. Later, when
Professor Dumbledore became Headmaster, he gave Mr. Hagrid a place
here as Keeper of Grounds and Keys."</p>
<p>Harry's eyes watched her intently. "You said that five decades
ago was the last time a student died in Hogwarts, and you were
certain that five decades ago was the last time someone heard the
Sorting Hat's secret message."</p>
<p>She felt a slight chill - even the Headmaster or Severus might
not have made that connection that quickly - and said, "Yes, Mr.
Potter. Someone opened the Chamber of Secrets, but this was not
believed, and Mr. Hagrid was blamed for the resulting death.
However, the Headmaster has located the additional enchantment on
the Sorting Hat, and he has shown it to a special panel of the
Wizengamot. As a result, Mr. Hagrid's sentence has been revoked -
just this morning, in fact - and he will be allowed to acquire a
new wand." She hesitated. "We... have not yet told Mr. Hagrid of
this, Mr. Potter. We were waiting until the deed was done, so as
not to give him false hope after so long. Mr. Potter... we were
wondering if we could tell Mr. Hagrid that it was you who helped
him...?"</p>
<p>She saw the weighing look in his eyes -</p>
<p>"I remember Mr. Hagrid holding you when you were a baby," she
said. "I think he would be very happy to know."</p>
<p>She could see it, though, on Harry's face, the moment when he
decided that Rubeus wouldn't be any use to him.</p>
<p>Harry shook his head. "Bad enough that someone might deduce
there was a Parselmouth in this year's crop of students," Harry
said. "I think it'd be more prudent to just keep it all as secret
as possible."</p>
<p>She remembered James and Lily, who'd never hesitated to return
the friendship the huge, bluff man had offered them, for all that
James was the scion of a wealthy House or Lily a budding Charms
Mistress, and Rubeus a mere half-giant whose wand had been
snapped...</p>
<p>"Because you don't expect him to prove useful, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>There was silence. She hadn't intended to say that out loud.</p>
<p>Sadness crossed Harry's face. "Probably," Harry said quietly.
"But I don't think he and I would get along, do you?"</p>
<p>Something seemed to be stuck in her throat.</p>
<p>"Speaking of making use of people," Harry said. "It seems I'm
going to be thrown into a war with a Dark Lord sometime soon. So
while I'm in your office, I'd like to ask that my sleep cycle be
extended to thirty hours per day. Neville Longbottom wants to start
practicing dueling, there's an older Hufflepuff who offered to
teach him, and they invited me to join. Plus there's other things I
want to learn too - and if you or the Headmaster think I should
study anything in particular, in order to become a powerful wizard
when I grow up, let me know. Please direct Madam Pomfrey to
administer the appropriate potion, or whatever it is that she needs
to do -"</p>
<p>"<em>Mr. Potter!</em> "</p>
<p>Harry's eyes gazed directly into her own. "Yes, Minerva? I know
it wasn't your idea, but I'd like to survive the use the
Headmaster's making of me. Please don't be an obstacle to
that."</p>
<p>It almost broke her. "Harry," she whispered in a bare voice,
"children shouldn't have to <em>think</em> like that!"</p>
<p>"You're right, they shouldn't," Harry said. "A <em>lot</em> of
children have to grow up too early, though, not just me; and most
children like that would probably trade places with me in five
seconds. I'm not going to pity myself, Professor McGonagall, not
when there are people out there in real trouble and I'm not one of
them."</p>
<p>She swallowed, hard, and said, "Mr. Potter, at thirty hours per
day, you'll - get <em>older,</em> you'll age faster -" <em>Like
Albus.</em></p>
<p>"And in my fifth year I'll be around the same physiological age
as Hermione," said Harry. "Doesn't seem <em>that</em> terrible."
There was a wry smile now on Harry's face. "Honestly, I'd probably
want this even if there <em>weren't</em> a Dark Lord. Wizards live
for a while, and either wizards or Muggles will probably push that
out even further over the next century. There's no reason
<em>not</em> to pack as many hours into a day as I can. I've got
things I plan to do, and 'twere well they were done quickly."</p>
<p>There was a long pause.</p>
<p>"All right," Minerva said. It came out as almost a whisper. She
raised her voice. "All right, Mr. Potter, I shall ask the
Headmaster, and if he agrees, it shall be done."</p>
<p>Harry's eyes narrowed for a moment. "I see. Then please remind
the Headmaster that Godric Gryffindor, in his last words, said that
if it had been the right thing for him to do, then he wouldn't tell
anyone else to choose wrongly, not even the youngest student in
Hogwarts."</p>
<p>And she knew with a hollow feeling that any chance of Albus
stopping this, stopping any of this, had just Vanished into
nothingness. That was what Albus had told her when she'd objected
that Cameron Edward was too young, and then when she'd objected
that Peter Pevensie was too young, and finally she'd given up
objecting. "Who told you that, Mr. Potter?" <em>Not Albus - surely
Albus would never</em> say <em>that to any student -</em></p>
<p>"I've been doing a lot of reading lately," Harry said. His body
started to rise from the enveloping chair, then halted. "Dare I ask
about the second piece of good news?"</p>
<p>"Oh," she said. "Ah - Professor Quirrell has woken up and says
that you may -"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The Hogwarts infirmary was a brilliantly open space, skylit on
all four sides despite seeming to be located squarely in the middle
of the castle. White beds in long rows stretched out, only three of
them occupied at the moment. One older boy and one older girl on
opposite sides, both lying motionless with their eyes closed,
probably unconscious and spell-bound while some healing Charm or
Potion reconfigured their bodies in uncomfortable ways; and the
third occupant had the curtain drawn around their bed, which was
presumably a good thing. Madam Pomfrey had pushed him along with a
hard shove and told him not to gawk, and Harry had needed to remind
himself sharply that some people still didn't know who the
Boy-Who-Lived was - either that, or Madam Pomfrey's identity was
bound up with her absolute dominance of her own hospital, etcetera,
whatever.</p>
<p>Behind the rows of beds were five doors, leading into the
private rooms where they stored the patients who would be staying
for days instead of hours, but whose condition didn't warrant a
transfer to St. Mungos.</p>
<p>Windowless, skyless, unlit but for a single smokeless torch on
one of the solid stone walls; that was the room behind the middle
door. Harry had wondered whether professors could ask Hogwarts to
change itself; or if the infirmary always had a room like that
available, for people who didn't enjoy the light.</p>
<p>In the center of the room, between two equal bedstands that
looked to have been carved from the same grey marble as the walls,
rested a white hospital bed, looking vaguely orangish in the
unsmoking torchlight; and within that bed, a white sheet pulled up
about his thighs and wearing a hospital gown, sat Professor
Quirrell with his back slightly propped up against the headboard of
the bed.</p>
<p>There was something frightening about seeing Professor Quirrell
in one of Madam Pomfrey's beds, even if the Defense Professor
appeared uninjured. Even knowing that Professor Quirrell had
deliberately arranged his own apparent defeat at Severus's hands,
to give himself an excuse to recover his strength from Azkaban.
Harry had never <em>actually</em> watched anyone dying in a
hospital bed, but he'd seen too many movies. It was an intimation
of mortality, and the Defense Professor was <em>not</em> supposed
to be mortal.</p>
<p>Madam Pomfrey had told Harry that he was absolutely forbidden to
pester her patient.</p>
<p>Harry had said, "I understand", which technically did not say
anything about obedience.</p>
<p>The stern old healer had then turned, and started to say to
Professor Quirrell that he was absolutely not to overexert himself
or... upset himself...</p>
<p>Madam Pomfrey had trailed off, hurriedly turned around, and fled
the room.</p>
<p>"Not bad," Harry observed, after the door had shut behind the
escaping medical matron. "I've got to learn how to do that,
sometime."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell smiled a smile with absolutely no humor
content, and said, his voice sounding a good deal dryer than its
usual dryness, "Thank you for your artistic critique, Mr.
Potter."</p>
<p>Harry stared into the pale blue eyes, and thought that Professor
Quirrell looked...</p>
<p>...older.</p>
<p>It was subtle, it might have just been Harry's imagination, it
might have been the poor lighting. But the hair above Quirinus
Quirrell's forehead might have receded a bit, what remained might
have thinned and greyed, an advancing of the baldness that had
already been visible on the back of his head. The face might have
grown a little sunken.</p>
<p>The pale blue eyes had stayed sharp and intense.</p>
<p>"I am glad," Harry said quietly, "to see you in what appears to
be good health."</p>
<p>"Appearances can be deceiving, of course," said Professor
Quirrell. He gave a flick of his fingers, and when his hand
finished the gesture he was holding his wand. "Would you believe
that woman thinks she has confiscated this from me?"</p>
<p>Six incantations the Defense Professor spoke then; six of the
thirty that he had used to safeguard their important conversations
in Mary's Room.</p>
<p>Harry raised his eyebrows, silently quizzical.</p>
<p>"That is all I can manage for now," said the Defense Professor.
"I expect it shall prove sufficient. Still, there is a proverb: If
you do not wish a thing heard, do not say it. Consider it to apply
in full measure. I am told that you were trying to see me?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said. He paused, gathered his thoughts. "Did the
Headmaster, or anyone, tell you that we can't go to lunch any
more?"</p>
<p>"Something along those lines," said the Defense Professor. And
without changing expression, "Of course I was terribly sorry to
hear it."</p>
<p>"It's more extreme than that, actually," said Harry. "I'm
confined to Hogwarts and its grounds indefinitely. I can't leave
without a guard and a good reason. I'm not going home for summer,
and maybe not ever again. I was hoping... to speak with you, about
that."</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor exhaled a breath like a brief sigh, and
said, "We shall just have to rely on the known fact that the Deputy
Headmistress will personally murder anyone who tries to report me.
Mr. Potter, I intend to keep this conversation on track so that we
may conclude it quickly, is that understood?"</p>
<p>Harry nodded, and -</p>
<p>In the light of the single torch, shaded toward the reddish end
of the optical spectrum, the snake's green scales were not very
reflective, and the blue-and-white banding hardly more so. Dark
seemed the snake, in that light. The eyes, which had seemed like
gray pits before, now reflected the torchlight, and seemed brighter
than the rest of the snake.</p>
<p>"<em>Sso,</em>" hissed the venomous creature. "<em>What did you
wissh to ssay?</em> "</p>
<p>And Harry hissed, "<em>Sschoolmasster thinkss that woman'ss
former Lord iss the one who sstole her from prisson</em>."</p>
<p>Harry <em>had</em> thought about it this time, and carefully,
before he had decided that he would reveal to Professor Quirrell
<em>only</em> that the Headmaster believed that; and <em>not</em>
say anything about the prophecy which had set Voldemort on Harry's
parents, nor that the Headmaster was reconstituting the Order of
the Phoenix... it was a risk, a significant risk, but Harry needed
an ally in this.</p>
<p>"<em>He believess that one iss alive?</em> " the snake finally
said. The divided, two-pronged tongue flickered rapidly from side
to side, sardonic snakish laughter. "<em>Ssomehow I am not
ssurprissed.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Yess,</em>" Harry hissed dryly, "<em>very amussing, I am
ssure. Except now am sstuck in Hogwartss for next ssix years, for
ssafety! I have decided that I will, indeed, sseek power; and
confinement iss not helpful for that. Musst convince sschoolmasster
that Dark Lord iss not yet awakened, that esscape was work of ssome
other power -</em>"</p>
<p>Again the rapid flickering of the snake's tongue; the snakish
laughter was stronger, dryer, this time. "<em>Amateur
foolisshnesss.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Pardon?</em> " hissed Harry.</p>
<p>"<em>You ssee misstake, think of undoing, ssetting time back to
sstart. Yet not even with hourglasss can time be undone. Musst move
forward insstead. You think of convincing otherss they are
misstaken. Far eassier to convince them they are right. Sso
conssider, boy: what new happensstance would make schoolmasster
decide you were ssafe once more, ssimultaneoussly advance your
other agendass?"</em></p>
<p>Harry stared at the snake, puzzled. His mind tried to comprehend
and unravel the riddle -</p>
<p>"<em>Iss it not obviouss?</em> " hissed the snake. Again the
tongue flickered sardonic laughter. "<em>To free yoursself, to gain
power in Britain, you musst again be sseen to defeat the Dark
Lord.</em>"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>In reddish-orange flickering torchlight, a green snake swayed
above a white hospital bed, as the boy stared into the embers of
its eyes.</p>
<p>"<em>Sso,</em>" Harry said finally. "<em>Let uss be clear on
what iss propossed. You ssuggesst that we sset up imposstor to
imperssonate Dark Lord."</em></p>
<p>"<em>Ssomething like that.</em> <em>Woman we resscued will
cooperate, sshould be mosst convincing when sshe iss sseen at hiss
sside.</em>" More sardonic tongue-flickering. "<em>You are
kidnapped from Hogwartss to public location, many witnesssess,
wardss keep out protectorss. Dark Lord announcess that he hass at
long lasst regained physical form, after wandering as sspirit for
yearss; ssayss that he hass gained sstill greater power, not even
you can sstop him now. Offerss to let you duel. You casst guardian
Charm, Dark Lord laughss at you, ssayss he iss not life-eater.
Casstss Killing Cursse at you, you block, watcherss ssee Dark Lord
explode -"</em></p>
<p>"<em>Casst Killing Cursse?</em> " Harry hissed in incredulity.
"<em>At me? Again? Ssecond time? Nobody will believe Dark Lord
could posssibly be that sstupid -</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>You and I are only two people in country who would notice
that,</em>" hissed the snake. "<em>Trusst me on thiss,
boy.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>What if there iss third, ssomeday?</em> "</p>
<p>The snake swayed thoughtfully. "<em>Could write different
sscript for play, if you wissh. Whatever sscenario, sshould leave
open posssibility Dark Lord might return yet again - nation musst
think they are sstill dependent on you to protect them.</em>"</p>
<p>Harry stared into the red-flickering pits of the snake's
eyes.</p>
<p>"<em>Well?</em> " hissed the swaying form.</p>
<p>The obvious thought was that going along with the Defense
Professor's plots and deceptions a <em>second</em> time, spinning
an even <em>more</em> complicated lie to cover up the first
mistake, and creating <em>another</em> fatal vulnerability if
anyone ever discovered the truth, would be <em>exactly</em> the
same sort of stupidity as the putative Dark Lord using the Killing
Curse again. It didn't even take his Hufflepuff side to point that
out, Harry thought it in his very own mental voice.</p>
<p>But there was also a certain question as to whether the
appropriate moral to learn from the last experience was to always
say <em>no</em> immediately to the Defense Professor, or...</p>
<p>"<em>Will think about it,</em>" hissed Harry. "<em>Will not
ansswer right away, thiss time, will enumerate risskss and
benefitss firsst -</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Undersstood,</em>" hissed the snake. "<em>But remember
thiss, boy, other eventss proceed without you. Hessitation iss
alwayss eassy, rarely usseful."</em></p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The boy emerged from the private room into the main infirmary,
running nervous fingers through his messy black hair as he walked
past the white beds, occupied and unoccupied.</p>
<p>Shortly afterward, the boy emerged from the Hogwarts infirmary
entirely, passing Madam Pomfrey on the way out with a distracted
nod.</p>
<p>The boy walked out into a hallway, then into a larger corridor,
and then stopped and leaned against the wall.</p>
<p>The thing was...</p>
<p>...he really <em>didn't</em> want to be stuck in Hogwarts for
the next six years; and when you thought about it...</p>
<p>... the Incident with Rescuing Bellatrix From Azkaban wasn't
<em>just</em> imposing costs on Harry. Other people would be
worrying, living in fear of the Dark Lord's return, expending
unknown resources to take unknown precautions. Harry could demand
that they write the script in such fashion as to make it seem
<em>not</em> plausible that the Dark Lord would return a third
time. And then people would relax, it would all be over.</p>
<p>Unless of course there actually <em>was</em> a Dark Lord out
there to be feared. There <em>had</em> been a prophecy.</p>
<p>The boy leaning against the wall vented a soft sigh, and started
walking again.</p>
<p>Harry had almost forgotten, but he <em>had</em> gotten around to
showing Professor Quirrell the deck of cards he'd been given on
Sunday night by 'Santa Claus', within which the King of Hearts was
allegedly a portkey that would take him to the Salem Witches'
Institute in America. Although of course Harry hadn't told
Professor Quirrell <em>who'd</em> sent him the card, nor what it
was <em>supposed</em> to do, before he'd asked Professor Quirrell
if it was possible to tell where the portkey would send him.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor had transformed back to human form, and
examined the King of Hearts, tapping it a few times with his
wand.</p>
<p>And according to Professor Quirrell...</p>
<p>...the portkey would send the user somewhere in London, but he
couldn't pinpoint it any nearer than that.</p>
<p>Harry had shown Professor Quirrell the note that had accompanied
the deck of cards, saying nothing of the earlier notes.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell had taken it in at a glance, given a dry
chuckle, and observed that if you read the note <em>carefully</em>,
it did not <em>explicitly</em> say that the portkey would take him
to the Salem Witches' Institute.</p>
<p>You needed to learn to pay attention to that kind of subtlety,
Professor Quirrell said, if you wanted to be a powerful wizard when
you grew up; or, indeed, if you wanted to grow up at all.</p>
<p>The boy sighed again as he trudged off to class.</p>
<p>He was starting to wonder if all the other wizarding schools
were also like this, or if it was only Hogwarts that had a
problem.</p>

1<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p><em>Hessitation iss alwayss eassy, rarely usseful.</em></p>
<p>So the Defense Professor had told him; and while you could
quibble about the details of the proverb, Harry understood the
weaknesses of Ravenclaws well enough to know that you had to try
<em>answering</em> your own quibbles. Did some plans call for
waiting? Yes, many plans called for <em>delayed action</em>; but
that was not the same as <em>hesitating</em> to <em>choose</em>.
Not delaying because you knew the right moment to do what was
necessary, but delaying because you couldn't make up your mind -
there was no cunning plan which called for that.</p>
<p>Did you sometimes need more information to choose? Yes, but that
could also turn into an excuse for delaying; and it would be
<em>tempting</em> to delay, when you were faced with a choice
between two painful alternatives, and <em>not choosing</em> would
avoid the mental pain for a time. So you would pick a piece of
information you couldn't easily obtain, and claim that you couldn't
possibly decide without it; that would be your excuse. Although if
you knew <em>what</em> information you needed, knew <em>when</em>
and <em>how</em> you would obtain that information, and knew what
you would <em>do</em> depending on each possible observation, then
that was less suspicious as an excuse for hesitating.</p>
<p>If you <em>weren't</em> just hesitating, you ought to be able to
choose <em>in advance</em> what you would do, once you had the
extra information you claimed you needed.</p>
<p>If the Dark Lord were <em>really</em> out there, would it be
smart to go along with Professor Quirrell's plan to have someone
impersonate the Dark Lord?</p>
<p>No. Definitely no. Absolutely not.</p>
<p>And if Harry knew for a <em>fact</em> that the Dark Lord
<em>wasn't</em> really out there... in <em>that</em> case...</p>
<p>The Defense Professor's office was a small room, at least today;
it had changed since the last time Harry had seen it, the stone of
the room becoming darker, more polished. Behind the Defense
Professor's desk stood the single empty bookcase that always
decorated the room, a tall bookcase stretching almost from the
floor to the ceiling, with seven empty wooden shelves. Harry had
only once seen Professor Quirrell take a book from those empty
shelves, and never seen him put a book back.</p>
<p>The green snake swayed above the seat of the chair behind the
Defense Professor's desk, the lidless eyes staring unblinking at
Harry from close to his own eye level.</p>
<p>They were warded now by twenty-two spells, all that could be
cast within Hogwarts without attracting the Headmaster's
attention.</p>
<p>"<em>No,</em>" hissed Harry.</p>
<p>The green snake cocked its head, tilting it slightly; no emotion
was conveyed by the gesture, not that Harry's Parselmouth talent
conveyed to him. "<em>Reasson not?</em> " said the green snake.</p>
<p>"<em>Too rissky,</em>" Harry said simply. That was true whether
or not the Dark Lord was out there. Forcing himself to decide in
advance had made him realize that he'd just been using the
unanswered question as an excuse to hesitate; the sane decision was
the same, either way.</p>
<p>For a moment the dark pitted eyes seemed to gleam blackly, for a
moment the scaled mouth gaped to expose the fangs. "<em>Think you
have learned wrong lessson, boy, from previouss failure. My planss
are not in habit of failing, and lasst one would have gone
flawlesssly, but for your own foolisshnesss. Correct lessson iss to
follow ssteps laid down for you by older and wisser Sslytherin,
tame your wild impulssess."</em></p>
<p>"<em>Lessson I learned is not to try plotss that would make
girl-child friend think I am evil or boy-child friend think I am
sstupid,</em>" Harry snapped back. He'd been planning a more
temporizing response than that, but somehow the words had just
slipped out.</p>
<p>The <em>sssss</em>-ing sound that came from the snake was not
heard by Harry as words, only as pure fury. A moment later,
"<em>You told them -</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Of coursse not! But know what they would ssay.</em>"</p>
<p>There was a long pause as the snake-head swayed, staring at
Harry; again no detectable emotion came through, and Harry wondered
what Professor Quirrell could be thinking that would take Professor
Quirrell that long to think.</p>
<p>"<em>You sserioussly care what thosse two think?</em> " came the
snake's final hiss. "<em>True younglingss thosse two are, not like
you. Could not weigh adult matterss.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Might have done better than me,</em>" Harry hissed.
"<em>Boy-child friend would have assked after ssecret motivess
before asssenting to resscue woman -</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Glad you undersstand that now,</em>" the snake hissed
coldly. "<em>Alwayss assk after other'ss advantage. Next learn to
alwayss assk after your own. If my plan iss not to your tasste,
what iss yours?</em> "</p>
<p>"<em>If necesssary - sstay at sschool ssix yearss and sstudy.
Hogwartss sseemss fine place to dwell. Bookss, friendss, sstrange
but tassty food.</em>" Harry wanted to chuckle, but there wasn't
any gesture in Parseltongue for the kind of laughter he wanted to
express.</p>
<p>The pits of the snake's eyes seemed almost black. "<em>Eassy to
ssay that now. Ssuch as you and I, we do not tolerate
imprissonment. You will losse patience long before sseventh year,
perhapss before end of thiss one. I sshall plan
accordingly.</em>"</p>
<p>And before Harry could hiss another word of Parseltongue, the
human-shape of Professor Quirrell was sitting in his chair once
more. "So, Mr. Potter," said the Defense Professor, his voice as
calm as if they had been discussing nothing important, as if the
whole conversation had not occurred at all, "I hear that you have
begun to practice dueling. Not the worthless sort with
<em>rules</em>, I hope?"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Hannah Abbott looked as unnerved as Hermione had ever seen her
(except on the day of the phoenix, the day Bellatrix Black had
escaped, which shouldn't ought to count for anyone). The Hufflepuff
girl had come over to the Ravenclaw table during dinner, and tapped
Hermione on her shoulder, and very nearly dragged her away -</p>
<p>"Neville and Harry Potter are learning dueling from Mr.
Diggory!" Hannah blurted as soon as they were a few steps away from
the table.</p>
<p>"Who?" said Hermione.</p>
<p>"<em>Cedric Diggory!</em> " said Hannah. "He's the Captain of
our Quidditch Team, and general of an army, and he's taking
<em>all</em> the electives and getting better grades than anyone,
and I hear he learns dueling from professional tutors during the
summers, and he once beat <em>two</em> seventh-year students, and
even some teachers call him the Super Hufflepuff, and Professor
Sprout says we should all emu, uh, emudate him or something like
that, and -"</p>
<p>After Hannah finally stopped for air (the list had gone on for a
while), Hermione managed to insert a word in edgewise.</p>
<p>"Sunshine Soldier Abbott!" said Hermione. "Calm <em>down</em>.
We're not going to be fighting General Diggory, right? Sure,
Neville's studying to beat us, but we can study too -"</p>
<p>"Don't you <em>see?</em> " Hannah shrieked, raising her voice a
lot louder than it should've been, if they were trying to keep the
conversation private from all the Ravenclaws looking at them.
"Neville isn't studying to beat <em>us!</em> He's practicing so he
can fight <em>Bellatrix Black!</em> They're going to go through us
like a Bludger through a stack of pancakes!"</p>
<p>The Sunshine General gave her soldier a look. "Listen," said
Hermione, "I don't think a few weeks of practice is going to make
anyone an invincible fighter. Plus we already <em>know</em> how to
handle invincible fighters. We'll concentrate fire on them and
they'll go down just like Draco."</p>
<p>The Hufflepuff girl was looking at her with mixed admiration and
skepticism. "Aren't you even, you know, <em>worried?</em> "</p>
<p>"Oh, <em>honestly!</em> " said Hermione. Sometimes it was hard
being the only sensible person in your whole school year. "Haven't
you ever heard the saying, the only thing we have to fear is fear
itself?"</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " said Hannah. "That's crazy, what about
Lethifolds lurking in the darkness, and being put under the
Imperius Curse, and horrible Transfiguration accidents and -"</p>
<p>"I <em>mean,</em>" said Hermione, exasperation leaking out into
her now-raised voice, she'd been hearing this sort of thing <em>all
week</em> now, "how about if we wait until <em>after</em> the Chaos
Legion <em>actually</em> crushes us to get so scared of them and
<em>did you just mutter 'Gryffindors' under your voice?</em> "</p>
<p>A few moments later, Hermione was walking back to her place at
the table with a sweet smile plastered onto her young face, it
wasn't the terrible cold glare of Harry's dark side but it was the
scariest face <em>she</em> knew how to make.</p>
<p>Harry Potter was going <em>down.</em></p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"This is loony," gasped Neville, with what tiny amount of breath
he could spare from being completely out of breath.</p>
<p>"This is <em>brilliant!</em> " said Cedric Diggory. The eyes of
the Super Hufflepuff gleamed with manic enthusiasm, shining like
the sweat on his forehead as he stamped his feet through the dance
of one of his dueling postures. His usually-light steps had changed
to heavier stomps, which might have had something to do with the
Transfigured metal weights they'd all attached to their arms and
legs and strapped over their chests. "Where do you <em>get</em>
these ideas, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>"A strange old shop... in Oxford... and I'm never... shopping
there... again." <em>Thud.</em></p>
</div>
<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 63: TSPE, Aftermaths<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p><em>Aftermath, Hermione Granger:</em></p>
<p>She was just starting to close up her books and put away her
homework in preparation for sleep, Padma and Mandy stacking up
their own books across the table from her, when Harry Potter walked
into the Ravenclaw common room; and it was only then that she
realized, she hadn't seen him at all since breakfast.</p>
<p>That realization was rapidly stomped-on by a much more startling
one.</p>
<p>There was a golden-red winged creature on Harry's shoulder, a
bright bird of fire.</p>
<p>And Harry looked sad and worn and really <em>tired</em> like the
phoenix was the only thing keeping him on his feet, but there was
still a warmth about him, if you crossed your eyes you might have
thought you were looking at the Headmaster somehow, that was the
impression that went through Hermione's mind even though it didn't
make any sense.</p>
<p>Harry Potter trudged across the Ravenclaw common room, past
sofas full of staring girls, past cardgame-circles of staring boys,
heading for her.</p>
<p>In theory she wasn't talking to Harry Potter yet, his week
wasn't up until tomorrow, but whatever was going on was clearly a
<em>whole</em> lot more important than that -</p>
<p>"Fawkes," Harry said, just as she was opening her mouth, "that
girl over there is Hermione Granger, she's not talking to me right
now because I'm an idiot, but if you want to be on a good person's
shoulder she's better than me."</p>
<p>So much exhaustion and hurt in Harry Potter's voice -</p>
<p>But before she could figure out what to do about it, the phoenix
had glided off Harry's shoulder like a fire creeping up a
matchstick on fast-forward, flashing toward her; there was a
phoenix flying in front of her and staring at her with eyes of
light and flame.</p>
<p>"<em>Caw?</em> " asked the phoenix.</p>
<p>Hermione stared at it, feeling like she was facing a question on
a test she'd forgotten to study for, the one most important
question and she'd gone her whole life without studying for it, she
couldn't find anything to say.</p>
<p>"I'm -" she said. "I'm only twelve, I haven't <em>done</em>
anything yet -"</p>
<p>The phoenix just glided gently around, rotating around one
wingtip like the being of light and air that it was, and soared
back to Harry Potter's shoulder, where it settled down quite
firmly.</p>
<p>"You silly boy," said Padma across from her, looking like she
was deciding whether to laugh or grimace, "phoenixes aren't for
smart girls who do their homework, they're for idiots who charge
straight at five older Slytherin bullies. There's a reason why the
Gryffindor colors are red and gold, you know."</p>
<p>There was a lot of friendly laughter in the Ravenclaw common
room.</p>
<p>Hermione wasn't one of the laughing ones.</p>
<p>Neither was Harry.</p>
<p>Harry had put a hand over his face. "Tell Hermione I'm sorry,"
he said to Padma, his voice almost fallen to a whisper. "Tell her I
forgot that phoenixes are animals, they don't understand time and
planning, they don't understand people who are <em>going</em> to do
good things later - I'm not sure they understand really the notion
of there being something that a person <em>is</em>, all they see is
what people do. Fawkes doesn't know what twelve means. Tell
Hermione I'm sorry - I shouldn't have - it just all goes wrong,
doesn't it?"</p>
<p>Harry turned to go, the phoenix still on his shoulder, began
slowly trudging toward the staircase that led up to his dorm.</p>
<p>And Hermione couldn't leave it at that, she just
<em>couldn't</em> leave it at that. She didn't know if it was her
competition with Harry or something else. She just couldn't leave
it with the phoenix turning away from her.</p>
<p>She <em>had</em> to -</p>
<p>Her mind keyed a frantic question to the entirety of her
excellent memory, found just one thing -</p>
<p>"I was going to run in front of the Dementor to try and save
Harry!" she shouted a little desperately at the red-golden bird. "I
mean, I actually did start running and everything! That was stupid
and courageous, right?"</p>
<p>With a warbling cry the phoenix launched itself from Harry's
shoulder again, back toward her like a spreading blaze, it circled
her three times like she was the center of an inferno, and for just
a moment its wing brushed against her cheek, before the phoenix
soared back to Harry.</p>
<p>There was a hush in the Ravenclaw common room.</p>
<p>"Told you so," Harry said aloud, and then he started climbing
the stairs up to his bedroom; he seemed to climb very quickly, like
he was very light on his feet for some reason, so that in just a
moment he and Fawkes were gone.</p>
<p>Hermione held up a trembling hand to her cheek where Fawkes had
brushed her with his wing, a spot of warmth lingering there like
that one small patch of skin had been very gently set on fire.</p>
<p>She'd answered the question of the phoenix, she supposed, but it
felt to her like she'd just barely squeaked by on the test, like
she'd gotten a 62 and she could've gotten 104 if she'd tried
harder.</p>
<p>If she'd tried at <em>all</em>.</p>
<p>She hadn't really <em>been</em> trying, when she thought about
it.</p>
<p>Just doing her homework -</p>
<p><em>Who have you saved?</em></p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Aftermath, Fawkes:</em></p>
<p>Nightmares, the boy had expected, screams and begging and
howling hurricanes of emptiness, the discharge of the horrors being
laid down into memory, and in that fashion, perhaps, becoming part
of the past.</p>
<p>And the boy knew that the nightmares would come.</p>
<p>The next night, they would come.</p>
<p>The boy dreamed, and in his dreams the world was on fire,
Hogwarts was on fire, his home was on fire, the streets of Oxford
were on fire, all ablaze with golden flames that shone but did not
consume, and all the people walking through the blazing streets
were shining with white light brighter than the fire, like they
were flames themselves, or stars.</p>
<p>The other first-year boys came to bed, and saw it for
themselves, the wonder whose rumor they had already heard, that in
his bed Harry Potter lay silent and motionless, a gentle smile on
his face, while perched on his pillow a red-golden bird watched
over him, with bright wings swept above him like a blanket pulled
over his head.</p>
<p>The reckoning had been put off one more night.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Aftermath, Draco Malfoy:</em></p>
<p>Draco straightened his robes, making sure the green trim was
straight. He waved his wand over his own head and said a Charm that
Father had taught him while other children were still playing in
mud, a Charm which ensured that not a single speck of lint or dust
would dirty his wizard's robes.</p>
<p>Draco picked up the mysterious envelope that Father had owled
him, and tucked it into his robes. He had already used
<em>Incendio</em> and <em>Everto</em> on the mysterious note.</p>
<p>And then he headed off to breakfast, to seat himself on exactly
the same tick of the clock where the food appeared, if he could
manage it, so that it would seem like all others had been waiting
on his appearance to eat. Because when you were the scion of Malfoy
you were first in everything, including breakfast, that was
why.</p>
<p>Vincent and Gregory were waiting for him outside the door of his
private room, up even before he was - though not, of course,
dressed quite as sharply.</p>
<p>The Slytherin common room was deserted, anyone who got up this
early was heading straight to breakfast anyway.</p>
<p>The dungeon halls were silent but for their own footsteps, empty
and echoing.</p>
<p>The Great Hall was a hubbub of alarm despite the relative few
arrivals, some younger children crying, students running back and
forth between tables or standing in knots shouting at each other, a
red-robed prefect was standing in front of two green-trimmed
students and yelling at them and Snape was striding toward the mess
-</p>
<p>The noise dimmed a little as people caught sight of Draco, as
some of the faces turned to stare at him, and fell quiet.</p>
<p>The food appeared on the tables. No one looked at it.</p>
<p>And Snape spun on his heel, abandoning his target, and headed
straight toward Draco.</p>
<p>A knot of fear clutched at Draco's heart, had something happened
to Father - no, surely Father would have told him - whatever was
happening, why hadn't Father told him -</p>
<p>There were bags of fatigue beneath Snape's eyes, Draco saw as
their Head of House came close, the Potions Master had never been a
sharp dresser (that was an understatement) but his robes were even
dirtier and more disarrayed this morning, spotted with extra
grease.</p>
<p>"You haven't heard?" hissed their Head of House as he came
close. "For pity's sake, Malfoy, don't you have a newspaper
delivered?"</p>
<p>"What is it, Profe-"</p>
<p>"Bellatrix Black was taken from Azkaban!"</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " said Draco in shock, as Gregory behind him
said something he really shouldn't have and Vincent just
gasped.</p>
<p>Snape was gazing at him with narrowed eyes, then nodded
abruptly. "Lucius told you nothing, then. I see." Snape gave a
snort, turned away -</p>
<p>"Professor!" said Draco. The implications were just starting to
dawn on him, his mind spinning frantically. "Professor, what should
I do - Father didn't instruct me -"</p>
<p>"Then I <em>suggest</em>," Snape said sneeringly, as he strode
away, "that you <em>tell</em> them that, Malfoy, as your father
intended!"</p>
<p>Draco glanced back at Vincent and Gregory, though he didn't know
why he was bothering, of course they looked even more confused than
he did.</p>
<p>And Draco walked forward to the Slytherin table, and sat down at
the far end, which was still empty of sitters.</p>
<p>Draco put a sausage omelet on his plate, began eating it with
automatic motions.</p>
<p>Bellatrix Black had been taken from Azkaban.</p>
<p>Bellatrix Black had been taken from Azkaban...?</p>
<p>Draco didn't know what to make of that, it was as totally
unexpected as the Sun going out - well, the Sun would expectedly go
out in six billion years but this was as unexpected as the Sun
going out <em>tomorrow</em>. Father wouldn't have done it,
Dumbledore wouldn't have done it, <em>no one</em> should have been
<em>able</em> to do it - what did it <em>mean</em> - what
<em>use</em> would Bellatrix be to anyone after ten years in
Azkaban - even if she got strong again, what use was a powerful
sorceress who was completely evil and insane and fanatically
devoted to a Dark Lord who wasn't around anymore?</p>
<p>"Hey," said Vincent from where he was sitting next to Draco, "I
don't understand, boss, why'd we do that?"</p>
<p>"<em>We</em> didn't do it, you dolt!" snapped Draco. "Oh, for
Merlin's sake, if even <em>you</em> think we - didn't your father
ever tell you any stories about Bellatrix Black? She tortured
Father once, she tortured <em>your</em> father, she's tortured
<em>everyone,</em> the Dark Lord once told her to Crucio
<em>herself</em> and she <em>did it!</em> She didn't do crazy
things to inspire fear and obedience in the populace, she did crazy
things because she's crazy! She's a <em>bitch</em> is what she
is!"</p>
<p>"Oh, really?" said an incensed voice from behind Draco.</p>
<p>Draco didn't look up. Gregory and Vincent would be watching his
back.</p>
<p>"I would've thought you'd be happy -"</p>
<p>"- to hear that a Death Eater had been freed, Malfoy!"</p>
<p>Amycus Carrow had always been one of the <em>other</em> problem
people; Father had once told Draco to make sure he was never alone
in the same room with Amycus...</p>
<p>Draco turned around and gave Flora and Hestia Carrow his Number
Three Sneer, the one that said that he was in a Noble and Most
Ancient House and they weren't and yes, that mattered. Draco said
in their general direction, certainly not deigning to address
<em>them</em> in particular, "There's Death Eaters and then there's
Death Eaters," and then turned back to his food.</p>
<p>There were two furious huffs in unison, and then two pairs of
shoes stormed off toward the other end of the Slytherin table.</p>
<p>It was a few minutes later that Millicent Bulstrode ran up to
them, visibly out of breath, and said, "Mr. Malfoy, did you
hear?"</p>
<p>"About Bellatrix Black?" said Draco. "Yeah -"</p>
<p>"No, about Potter!"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Potter was going around with a <em>phoenix</em> on his shoulder
last night, looking like he'd been dragged through ten leagues of
mud, they say that the phoenix took him to Azkaban to try to stop
Bellatrix and he fought a duel with her and they blew up half the
fortress!"</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " said Draco. "Oh, there is just no <em>way</em>
that -"</p>
<p>Draco stopped.</p>
<p>He'd said that a number of times about Harry Potter and had
started to notice a trend.</p>
<p>Millicent ran off to tell someone else.</p>
<p>"You don't <em>really</em> think -" said Gregory.</p>
<p>"I honestly don't know anymore," said Draco.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, after Theodore Nott had sat down across
from him and William Rosier had gone to sit with the Carrow twins,
Vincent nudged him and said, "There."</p>
<p>Harry Potter had entered the Great Hall.</p>
<p>Draco watched him closely.</p>
<p>There was no alarm on Harry's face as he saw, no surprise or
shock, he just looked...</p>
<p>It was the same distant, self-absorbed look Harry wore when he
was trying to figure out the answer to a question Draco couldn't
understand yet.</p>
<p>Draco hastily shoved himself up from the bench of the Slytherin
table, saying "Stay behind," and walked with all decorous speed
toward Harry.</p>
<p>Harry seemed to notice his approach just as the other boy was
turning toward the Ravenclaw table, and Draco -</p>
<p>- gave Harry one quick look -</p>
<p>- and then walked right past him, straight out of the Great
Hall.</p>
<p>It was a minute later that Harry peered around the corner of the
small stony nook where Draco had waited, it might not fool everyone
but it would create plausible deniability.</p>
<p>"<em>Quietus</em>," said Harry. "Draco, what -"</p>
<p>Draco took the envelope out of his robes. "I have a message for
you from Father."</p>
<p>"<em>Huh?</em> " said Harry, and took the envelope from Draco,
and tore it open in a rather un-neat manner, and drew forth a sheet
of parchment and unfolded it and -</p>
<p>Harry gave a sharp intake of breath.</p>
<p>Then Harry looked at Draco.</p>
<p>Then Harry looked back down at the parchment.</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>Harry said, "Did Lucius tell you to report on my reaction to
this?"</p>
<p>Draco paused for a moment, weighing, and then opened his mouth
-</p>
<p>"I see he did," said Harry, and Draco cursed himself, he
should've known better, only it <em>had</em> been hard to decide.
"What are you going to tell him?"</p>
<p>"That you were surprised," said Draco.</p>
<p>"Surprised," Harry said flatly. "Yeah. Good. Tell him that."</p>
<p>"What <em>is</em> it?" said Draco. And then, as he saw Harry
looking conflicted, "If you're dealing with Father behind my back
-"</p>
<p>And Harry, without a word, gave Draco the paper.</p>
<p>It said:</p>
<p><em>I know it was you.</em></p>
<p>"<em>WHAT THE -</em>"</p>
<p>"I was going to ask <em>you</em> that," said Harry. "Have you
got <em>any</em> idea what's up with your Dad?"</p>
<p>Draco stared at Harry.</p>
<p>Then Draco said, "<em>Did</em> you do it?"</p>
<p>"What?" said Harry. "What <em>possible</em> reason would I -
<em>how</em> would I -"</p>
<p>"Did you do it, Harry?"</p>
<p>"No!" Harry said. "Of course not!"</p>
<p>Draco had listened carefully, but he hadn't detected any
hesitation or tremor.</p>
<p>So Draco nodded, and said, "I've got no idea what Father's
thinking but it <em>can't</em>, I mean it <em>can't possibly</em>
be good. And, um... people are also saying..."</p>
<p>"What," said Harry warily, "are they saying, Draco?"</p>
<p>"Did a phoenix <em>really</em> take you to Azkaban to try to
stop Bellatrix Black from escaping -"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Aftermath: Neville Longbottom</em></p>
<p>Harry had only just sat down at the Ravenclaw table for the
first time, hoping to grab a quick bite of food. He knew he needed
to go off and think about things, but there was a tiny remaining
bit of phoenix's peace (even after the encounter with Draco) that
he still wanted to cling to, some beautiful dream of which he
remembered nothing but the beauty; and the part of him that
<em>wasn't</em> feeling peaceful was waiting for all the anvils to
finish dropping on him, so that when he went off to think and be by
himself for a while, he could batch-process all the disasters at
once.</p>
<p>Harry's hand grasped a fork, lifted a bite of mashed potatoes
toward his mouth -</p>
<p>And there was a shriek.</p>
<p>Every now and then someone would shout when they heard the news,
but Harry's ears <em>recognized</em> this one -</p>
<p>Harry was up from the bench in an instant, heading toward the
Hufflepuff table, a horrible sick feeling dawning in the pit of his
stomach. It was one of those things he hadn't considered when he'd
decided to commit the crime, because Professor Quirrell had planned
for no one to know; and now, afterward, Harry just - hadn't
<em>thought</em> of it -</p>
<p><em>This,</em> Hufflepuff said with bitter intensity, <em>is
also your fault.</em></p>
<p>But by the time Harry got there, Neville was sitting down and
eating fried sausage patties with Snippyfig Sauce.</p>
<p>The Hufflepuff boy's hands were trembling, but he cut the food,
and ate it, without dropping it.</p>
<p>"Hello, General," Neville said, his voice wavering only
slightly. "Did you fight a duel with Bellatrix Black last
night?"</p>
<p>"No," Harry said. His own voice was also wavery, for some
reason.</p>
<p>"Didn't think so," said Neville. There was a scraping sound as
his knife cut the sausage again. "I'm going to hunt her down and
kill her, can I count on you to help?"</p>
<p>There were startled gasps from the mass of Hufflepuffs who had
gathered around Neville.</p>
<p>"If she comes after you," Harry said hoarsely, <em>if it was all
a terrible mistake, if it was all a lie,</em> "I'll defend you even
with my life," <em>won't let you get hurt for what I did, no matter
what,</em> "but I won't help you go after her, Neville, friends
don't help friends commit suicide."</p>
<p>Neville's fork paused on the way to his mouth.</p>
<p>Then Neville put the bite of food in his mouth, chewed
again.</p>
<p>And Neville swallowed it.</p>
<p>And Neville said, "I didn't mean <em>right now</em>, I mean
after I graduate Hogwarts."</p>
<p>"Neville," Harry said, keeping his voice under very careful
control, "I think, even after you graduate, that might still be a
<em>just plain</em> <em>stupid idea.</em> There's got to be much
more experienced Aurors tracking her -" <em>oh, wait, that's not
good</em> -</p>
<p>"Listen to him!" said Ernie Macmillan, and then an older-looking
Hufflepuff girl standing close to Neville said, "Nevvy, please,
think about it, he's right!"</p>
<p>Neville stood up.</p>
<p>Neville said, "Please don't follow me."</p>
<p>Neville walked away from all of them; Harry and Ernie reaching
out involuntarily toward him, and some of the other Hufflepuffs as
well.</p>
<p>And Neville sat down at the Gryffindor table, and distantly
(though they had to strain to hear) they heard Neville say, "I'm
going to hunt her down and kill her after I graduate, anyone want
to help?" and at least five voices said "Yes" and then Ron Weasley
said loudly, "Get in line, you lot, I got an owl from Mum this
morning, she says to tell everyone she's called dibs" and someone
said "<em>Molly Weasley</em> against <em>Bellatrix Black?</em> Who
does she even think she's kidding -" and Ron reached over to a
plate and hefted a muffin -</p>
<p>Someone tapped Harry on the shoulder, and he turned around and
saw an unfamiliar green-trimmed older girl, who handed him a
parchment envelope and then quickly strode away.</p>
<p>Harry stared at the envelope for a moment, then started walking
toward the nearest wall. That wasn't very private, but it should be
private enough, and Harry didn't want to give the impression of
having much to hide.</p>
<p>That had been a Slytherin System delivery, what you used if you
wanted to communicate with someone without anyone else knowing that
the two of you had talked. The sender gave an envelope to someone
who had a reputation for being a reliable messenger, along with ten
Knuts; that first person would take five Knuts and pass the
envelope to another messenger along with the other five Knuts, and
the second messenger would open up that envelope and find another
envelope with a name written on it and deliver that envelope to
that person. That way neither of the two people passing the message
knew both the sender <em>and</em> the recipient, so no one else
knew that those two parties had been in contact...</p>
<p>When Harry reached the wall, he put the envelope inside his
robes, opened it beneath the folds of cloth, and carefully snuck a
peek at the parchment he drew forth.</p>
<p>It said,</p>
<p><em>Classroom to the left of Transfiguration, 8 in the
morning.</em></p>
<p><em>- LL.</em></p>
<p>Harry stared at it, trying to remember if he knew anyone with
the initials LL.</p>
<p>His mind searched...</p>
<p>Searched...</p>
<p>Retrieved -</p>
<p>"The <em>Quibbler</em> girl?" Harry whispered incredulously, and
then shut his mouth. She was only ten years old, she shouldn't be
in Hogwarts at all!</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Aftermath: Lesath Lestrange.</em></p>
<p>Harry was standing in the unused classroom next to
Transfiguration at 8AM, waiting, he'd at least managed to get some
food into himself before facing the next disaster, Luna
Lovegood...</p>
<p>The door to the classroom opened, and Harry saw, and gave
himself a really <em>hard</em> mental kick.</p>
<p>One more thing he hadn't thought of, one more thing he
<em>really should have.</em></p>
<p>The older boy's green-trimmed formal robes were askew, there
were red spots on them looking very much like small dots of fresh
blood, and one corner of his mouth had the look of a place that had
been cut and healed, by <em>Episkey</em> or some other minor
medical Charm that didn't quite erase all the damage.</p>
<p>Lesath Lestrange's face was streaked with tears, fresh tears and
half-dried tears, and there was water in his eyes, a promise of
still more on the way. "<em>Quietus,</em>" said the older boy, and
then "<em>Homenum Revelio</em>" and some other things, while Harry
thought frantically and without much luck.</p>
<p>And then Lesath lowered his wand and sheathed it in his robes,
and slowly this time, formally, the older boy dropped to his knees
on the dusty classroom floor.</p>
<p>Bowed his head all the way down, until his forehead also touched
the dust, and Harry would have spoken but he was voiceless.</p>
<p>Lesath Lestrange said, in a breaking voice, "My life is yours,
my Lord, and my death as well."</p>
<p>"I," Harry said, there was a huge lump in his throat and he was
having trouble speaking, "I -" <em>didn't have anything to do with
it,</em> he should have been saying, should be saying <em>right
now,</em> but then again the innocent Harry would have had trouble
speaking too -</p>
<p>"Thank you," whispered Lesath, "thank you, my Lord, oh, thank
you," the sound of a choked-off sob came from the kneeling boy, all
Harry could see of him was the hair on the back of his head,
nothing of his face. "I'm a fool, my Lord, an ungrateful bastard,
unworthy to serve you, I cannot abase myself enough, for I - I
shouted at you after you helped me, because I thought you were
refusing me, and I didn't even realize until this morning that I'd
been such a fool as to ask you in front of Longbottom -"</p>
<p>"I didn't have anything to do with it," Harry said.</p>
<p>(It was still very hard to tell an outright lie like that.)</p>
<p>Slowly Lesath raised his head from the floor, looked up at
Harry.</p>
<p>"I understand, my Lord," said the older boy, his voice wavering
a little, "you do not trust my cunning, and indeed I have shown
myself a fool... I only wanted to say to you, that I am not
ungrateful, that I know it must have been hard enough to save only
one person, that they're alerted now, that you can't - get Father -
but I am not ungrateful, I will never be ungrateful to you again.
If ever you have a use for this unworthy servant, call me wherever
I am, and I will answer, my Lord -"</p>
<p>"I was not involved in any way."</p>
<p>(But it got easier each time.)</p>
<p>Lesath gazed up at Harry, said uncertainly, "Am I dismissed from
your presence, my Lord...?"</p>
<p>"I am not your Lord."</p>
<p>Lesath said, "Yes, my Lord, I understand," and pushed himself
back up from the floor, stood straight and bowed deeply, then
backed away from Harry until he turned to open the classroom
door.</p>
<p>As Lesath's hand touched the doorknob, he paused.</p>
<p>Harry couldn't see Lesath's face, as the older boy's voice said,
"Did you send her to someone who would take care of her? Did she
ask about me at all?"</p>
<p>And Harry said, his voice perfectly level, "Please stop that. I
was not involved in any way."</p>
<p>"Yes, my Lord, I'm sorry, my Lord," said Lesath's voice; and the
Slytherin boy opened the door and went out and shut the door behind
him. His feet sped up as he ran away, but not fast enough that
Harry couldn't hear him start sobbing.</p>
<p><em>Would I cry?</em> wondered Harry. <em>If I knew nothing, if
I was innocent, would I cry right now?</em></p>
<p>Harry didn't know, so he just kept looking at the door.</p>
<p>And some unbelievably tactless part of him thought, <em>Yay, we
completed a quest and got a minion -</em></p>
<p><em>Shut up. If you ever want to vote on anything ever again...
shut up.</em></p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Aftermath, Amelia Bones:</em></p>
<p>"Then his life isn't in danger, I take it," said Amelia.</p>
<p>The healer, a stern-eyed old man who wore his robes white (he
was a Muggleborn and honoring some strange tradition of Muggles, of
which Amelia had never asked, although privately she thought it
made him look too much like a ghost), shook his head and said,
"Definitely not."</p>
<p>Amelia looked at the human form resting unconscious on the
healer's bed, the burned and blasted flesh, the thin sheet that
covered him for modesty's sake having been peeled back at her
command.</p>
<p>He might make a full recovery.</p>
<p>He might not.</p>
<p>The healer had said it was too early to say.</p>
<p>Then Amelia looked at the other witch in the room, the
detective.</p>
<p>"And you say," Amelia said, "that the burning matter was
Transfigured from <em>water</em>, presumably in the form of
ice."</p>
<p>The detective nodded her head, and said, sounding puzzled, "It
could have been much worse, if not for -"</p>
<p>"How <em>very nice</em> of them," she spat, and then pressed a
weary hand to her forehead. No... no, it <em>had</em> been intended
as a kindness. By the final stage of the escape there would be no
point in trying to fool anyone. Whoever had done this, then,
<em>had</em> been trying to mitigate the damage - and they'd been
thinking in terms of Aurors breathing the smoke, not of anyone
being attacked with the fire. If it had been them still in control,
no doubt, they would have steered the rocker more mercifully.</p>
<p>But Bellatrix Black had ridden the rocker out of Azkaban alone,
all the watching Aurors had agreed on that, they'd had their
Anti-Disillusionment Charms active and there had been only one
woman on that rocker, though the rocker had sported two sets of
stirrups.</p>
<p>Some good and innocent person, capable of casting the Patronus
Charm, had been tricked into rescuing Bellatrix Black.</p>
<p>Some innocent had fought Bahry One-Hand, carefully subduing an
experienced Auror without significantly injuring him.</p>
<p>Some innocent had Transfigured the fuel for the Muggle artifact
on which the two of them had been to ride out of Azkaban, making it
from frozen water for the benefit of her Aurors.</p>
<p>And then their usefulness to Bellatrix Black had ended.</p>
<p>You would have expected anyone capable of subduing Bahry
One-Hand to have foreseen that part. But then you wouldn't have
expected anyone who could cast the Patronus Charm to try rescuing
Bellatrix Black in the first place.</p>
<p>Amelia passed her hand down over her eyes, closing them for a
moment in silent mourning. <em>I wonder who it was, and how
You-Know-Who manipulated them... what story they could</em>
possibly <em>have been told...</em></p>
<p>She didn't even realize until a moment later that the thought
meant she was starting to believe. Perhaps because, no matter how
difficult it was to believe Dumbledore, it was becoming more
difficult <em>not</em> to recognize the hand of that cold, dark
intelligence.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Aftermath, Albus Dumbledore:</em></p>
<p>It might have been only fifty-seven seconds before breakfast
ended and he might have needed four twists of his Time-Turner, but
in the end, Albus Dumbledore did make it.</p>
<p>"Headmaster?" squeaked the polite voice of Professor Filius
Flitwick, as the old wizard passed him by on his way to his seat.
"Mr. Potter left a message for you."</p>
<p>The old wizard stopped. He looked inquiringly at the Charms
Professor.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter said that after he woke up, he realized how unfair
had been the things he said to you after Fawkes screamed. Mr.
Potter said that he wasn't saying anything about anything else,
just apologizing for that one part."</p>
<p>The old wizard kept looking at his Charms Professor, and still
did not speak.</p>
<p>"Headmaster?" squeaked Filius.</p>
<p>"Tell him I said thank you," said Albus Dumbledore, "but that it
is wiser to listen to phoenixes than to wise old wizards," and sat
down at his place three seconds before all the food vanished.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Aftermath, Professor Quirrell:</em></p>
<p>"No," Madam Pomfrey snapped at the child, "you may <em>not</em>
see him! You may not <em>pester</em> him! You may not ask him
<em>one little question!</em> He is to rest <em>in bed</em> and do
<em>nothing</em> for at least <em>three days!</em> "</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Aftermath, Minerva McGonagall:</em></p>
<p>She was heading toward the infirmary, and Harry Potter was
leaving it, when they passed each other.</p>
<p>The look he gave her wasn't angry.</p>
<p>It wasn't sad.</p>
<p>It didn't say much at all.</p>
<p>It was like... like he was looking at her just long enough to
make it clear that he <em>wasn't</em> deliberately avoiding looking
at her.</p>
<p>And then he looked away before she could figure out what look to
give him in return; as though he wanted to spare her that, as
well.</p>
<p>He didn't say anything as he walked past her.</p>
<p>Neither did she.</p>
<p>What could there possibly be to say?</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Aftermath, Fred and George Weasley:</em></p>
<p>They actually yelped out loud, when they turned the corner and
saw Dumbledore.</p>
<p>It wasn't that the Headmaster had popped up out of nowhere and
was staring at them with a stern expression. Dumbledore was always
doing <em>that</em>.</p>
<p>But the wizard was dressed in formal black robes and looking
<em>very</em> ancient and <em>very</em> powerful and he was giving
the two of them a SHARP LOOK.</p>
<p>"Fred and George Weasley!" spake Dumbledore in a Voice of
Power.</p>
<p>"Yes, Headmaster!" they said, snapping upright and giving him a
crisp military salute they'd seen in some old pictures.</p>
<p>"Hear me well! You are the friends of Harry Potter, is this
so?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Headmaster!"</p>
<p>"Harry Potter is in danger. He <em>must not</em> go beyond the
wards of Hogwarts. Listen to me, sons of Weasley, I beg you listen:
you know that I am as Gryffindor as yourselves, that I too know
there are higher rules than rules. But this, Fred and George, this
one thing is of the most terrible importance, there must be no
exception this time, small or great! If you help Harry to leave
Hogwarts he may <em>die!</em> Does he send you on a mission, you
may go, does he ask you to bring him items, you may help, but if he
asks you to smuggle his own person out of Hogwarts, you <em>must
refuse!</em> Do you understand?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Headmaster!" They said it without even thinking, really,
and then exchanged uncertain looks with each other -</p>
<p>The bright blue eyes of the Headmaster were intent upon them.
"No. Not without thinking. If Harry asks you to bring him out, you
must refuse, if he asks you to tell him the way, you must refuse. I
will not ask you to report him to me, for that I know you would
never do. But beg him on my behalf to go to <em>me,</em> if it is
of such importance, and <em>I</em> will guard him as he walks.
Fred, George, I am sorry to strain your friendship so, but it is
his <em>life.</em>"</p>
<p>The two of them looked at each other for a long while, not
communicating, only thinking the same things at the same time.</p>
<p>They looked back at Dumbledore.</p>
<p>They said, with a chill running through them as they spoke the
name, "Bellatrix Black."</p>
<p>"You may safely assume," said the Headmaster, "that it is at
least that bad."</p>
<p>"Okay -"</p>
<p>"- got it."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Aftermath, Alastor Moody and Severus Snape:</em></p>
<p>When Alastor Moody had lost his eye, he had commandeered the
services of a most erudite Ravenclaw, Samuel H. Lyall, whom Moody
mistrusted slightly less than average because Moody had refrained
from reporting him as an unregistered werewolf; and he had paid
Lyall to compile a list of every known magical eye, and every known
hint to their location.</p>
<p>When Moody had gotten the list back, he hadn't bothered reading
most of it; because at the top of the list was the Eye of Vance,
dating back to an era before Hogwarts, and currently in the
possession of a powerful Dark Wizard ruling over some tiny
forgotten hellhole that wasn't in Britain or anywhere else he'd
have to worry about silly rules.</p>
<p>That was how Alastor Moody had lost his left foot and acquired
the Eye of Vance, and how the oppressed souls of Urulat had been
liberated for a period of around two weeks before another Dark
Wizard moved in on the power vacuum.</p>
<p>He'd considered going after the Left Foot of Vance next, but had
decided against it after he realized that would be <em>just what
they were expecting.</em></p>
<p>Now Mad-Eye Moody was turning slowly, always turning, surveying
the graveyard of Little Hangleton. It should have been a lot
gloomier, that place, but in the broad daylight it seemed like
nothing but a grassy place marked by ordinary tombstones,
demarcated by the chained twists of fragile, easily climbable metal
that Muggles used instead of wards. (Moody could not comprehend
what the Muggles were thinking on that score, if they were
<em>pretending</em> to have wards, or what, and he had decided not
to ask whether Muggle criminals respected the pretense.)</p>
<p>Moody didn't actually <em>need</em> to turn to survey the
graveyard.</p>
<p>The Eye of Vance saw the full globe of the world in every
direction around him, no matter where it was pointing.</p>
<p>But there was no particular reason to let a former Death Eater
like Severus Snape know that.</p>
<p>Sometimes people called Moody 'paranoid'.</p>
<p>Moody always told them to survive a hundred years of hunting
Dark Wizards and then get back to him about that.</p>
<p>Mad-Eye Moody had once worked out how long it had taken him, in
retrospect, to achieve what he now considered a decent level of
caution - weighed up how much experience it had taken him to get
<em>good</em> instead of <em>lucky</em> - and had begun to suspect
that most people died before they got there. Moody had once
expressed this thought to Lyall, who had done some ciphering and
figuring, and told him that a typical Dark Wizard hunter would die,
on average, eight and a half times along the way to becoming
'paranoid'. This explained a great deal, assuming Lyall wasn't
lying.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Albus Dumbledore had told Mad-Eye Moody that the Dark
Lord had used unspeakable dark arts to survive the death of his
body, and was now awake and abroad, seeking to regain his power and
begin the Wizarding War anew.</p>
<p>Someone else might have reacted with incredulity.</p>
<p>"I can't believe you lot never told me about this resurrection
thing," Mad-Eye Moody said with considerable acerbity. "D'you
realize how long it'll take me to do the grave of every ancestor of
every Dark Wizard I've ever killed who could've been smart enough
to make a horcrux? You're not just <em>now</em> doing this one, are
you?"</p>
<p>"I redose this one every year," Severus Snape said calmly,
uncapping the third flask of what the man had <em>claimed</em>
would be seventeen bottles, and beginning to wave his wand over it.
"The other ancestral graves we've been able to locate were poisoned
with only the long-lasting substances, since some of us have less
free time than yourself."</p>
<p>Moody watched the fluid spiraling out of the vial and vanishing,
to appear within the bones where marrow had once been. "But you
think it's worth the effort of the trap, instead of just Vanishing
the bones."</p>
<p>"He <em>does</em> have other avenues to life, should he perceive
this one blocked," Snape said dryly, uncapping a fourth bottle.
"And before you ask, it must be the original grave, the place of
first burial, the bone removed during the ritual and not before.
Thus he cannot have retrieved it earlier; and also there is no
point in substituting the skeleton of a weaker ancestor. He would
notice it had lost all potency."</p>
<p>"Who else knows about this trap?" Moody demanded.</p>
<p>"You. Me. The Headmaster. No one else."</p>
<p>Moody snorted. "Pfah. Did Albus tell Amelia, Bartemius, and that
McGonagall woman about the resurrection ritual?"</p>
<p>"Yes -"</p>
<p>"If Voldie finds out that Albus knows about the resurrection
ritual and that Albus told <em>them</em>, Voldie'll figure that
Albus told <em>me,</em> and Voldie <em>knows</em> I'd think of
this." Moody shook his head in disgust. "What're these other ways
Voldie could come back to life?"</p>
<p>Snape's hand paused on the fifth bottle (it was all
Disillusioned, of course, the whole operation was Disillusioned,
but that meant less than nothing to Moody, it just marked you in
his Eye's sight as trying-to-hide), and the former Death Eater
said, "You don't need to know."</p>
<p>"You're learning, son," said Moody with mild approval. "What's
in the bottles?"</p>
<p>Snape opened the fifth bottle, gestured with his wand to begin
the substance flowing toward the grave, and said, "This one? A
Muggle narcotic called LSD. A conversation yesterday put me in mind
of Muggle things, and LSD seemed the most interesting option, so I
hurried to obtain some. If it is incorporated into the resurrection
potion, I suspect its effects will be permanent."</p>
<p>"What does it do?" said Moody.</p>
<p>"It is said that the effects are impossible to describe to
anyone who has not used it," drawled Snape, "and I have not used
it."</p>
<p>Moody nodded approval as Snape opened the sixth flask. "What
about that one?"</p>
<p>"Love potion."</p>
<p><em>"Love potion?</em> " said Moody.</p>
<p>"Not of the standard sort. It is meant to trigger a two-way bond
with an unbearably sweet Veela woman named Verdandi who the
Headmaster hopes might be able to redeem even him, if they truly
loved each other."</p>
<p>"<em>Gah!</em> " said Moody. "That bloody sentimental fool
-"</p>
<p>"Agreed," Severus Snape said calmly, his attention focused on
his work.</p>
<p>"Tell me you've at least got some Malaclaw venom in there."</p>
<p>"Second flask."</p>
<p>"Iocane powder."</p>
<p>"Either the fourteenth or fifteenth bottle."</p>
<p>"Bahl's Stupefaction," Moody said, naming an extremely addictive
narcotic with interesting side effects on people with Slytherin
tendencies; Moody had once seen an addicted Dark Wizard go to
ridiculous lengths to get a victim to lay hands on a certain exact
portkey, instead of just having someone toss the target a trapped
Knut on their next visit to town; and after going to all that work,
the addict had gone to the <em>further</em> effort to lay a
<em>second Portus,</em> on the <em>same portkey,</em> which had, on
a second touch, transported the victim back to safety. To this day,
even taking the drug into account, Moody could not imagine what
could have possibly been going through the man's mind at the time
he had cast the second Portus.</p>
<p>"Tenth vial," said Snape.</p>
<p>"Basilisk venom," offered Moody.</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " spat Snape. "Snake venom is a positive
component of the resurrection potion! Not to mention that it would
dissolve the bone and all the other substances! And where would
<em>we</em> even get -"</p>
<p>"Calm down, son, I was just checking to see if you could be
trusted."</p>
<p>Mad-Eye Moody continued his (secretly unnecessary) slow turning,
surveying the graveyard, and the Potions Master continued
pouring.</p>
<p>"Hold on," Moody said suddenly. "How do you know <em>this</em>
is really where -"</p>
<p>"Because it says 'Tom Riddle' on the easily moved headstone,"
Snape said dryly. "And I have just won ten Sickles from the
Headmaster, who bet you would think of that before the fifth
bottle. So much for constant vigilance."</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>"How long did it take Albus to reali-"</p>
<p>"Three years after we learned of the ritual," said Snape, in a
tone not quite like his usual sardonic drawl. "In retrospect, we
should have consulted you earlier."</p>
<p>Snape uncapped the ninth bottle.</p>
<p>"We poisoned all the other graves as well, with long-lasting
substances," remarked the former Death Eater. "It <em>is</em>
possible that we are in the correct graveyard. He may not have
planned this far ahead back when he was slaughtering his family,
and he cannot move the grave itself -"</p>
<p>"The true location doesn't look like a graveyard any more,"
Moody said flatly. "He moved all the <em>other</em> graves here and
Memory-Charmed the Muggles. Not even Bellatrix Black would be told
anything about that until just before the ritual started. <em>No
one</em> knows the true location now except him."</p>
<p>They continued their futile work.</p>

<p><em>Aftermath, Blaise Zabini:</em></p>
<p>The Slytherin common room could be accurately and precisely
described as a remilitarized zone; the moment you stepped through
the portrait hole you would see that the left half of the room was
Definitely Not Talking to the right half and vice versa. It was
very clear, it did not need to be explained to anyone, that you did
<em>not</em> have the option of <em>not taking sides</em>.</p>
<p>At a table in the exact middle of the room, Blaise Zabini sat by
himself, smirking as he did his homework. He had a reputation now,
and meant to keep it.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Aftermath, Daphne Greengrass and Tracey Davis:</em></p>
<p>"You doing anything interesting today?" said Tracey.</p>
<p>"Nope," said Daphne.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Aftermath, Harry Potter:</em></p>
<p>If you went high enough in Hogwarts, you didn't see many other
people around, just corridors and windows and staircases and the
occasional portrait, and now and then some interesting sight, such
as a bronze statue of a furry creature like a small child, holding
a peculiar flat spear...</p>
<p>If you went high enough in Hogwarts, you didn't see many other
people around, which suited Harry.</p>
<p>There were much worse places to be trapped, Harry supposed. In
fact you probably couldn't think of anywhere <em>better</em> to be
trapped than an ancient castle with a fractal ever-changing
structure that meant you couldn't ever run out of places to
explore, full of interesting people and interesting books and
incredibly important knowledge unknown to Muggle science.</p>
<p>If Harry hadn't been told that he <em>couldn't</em> leave, he
probably would've <em>jumped</em> at the chance to spend more time
in Hogwarts, he would've plotted and connived to get it. Hogwarts
was literally <em>optimal,</em> not in all the realms of
possibility maybe, but certainly on the real planet Earth, it was
the Maximum Fun Location.</p>
<p>How could the castle and its grounds seem so much smaller, so
much more confining, how could the rest of the world become so much
more interesting and important, the instant Harry had been told
that he wasn't allowed to leave? He'd spent <em>months</em> here
and hadn't felt claustrophobic <em>then.</em></p>
<p><em>You</em> know <em>the research on this,</em> observed some
part of himself, <em>it's just standard scarcity effects, like that
time where as soon as a county outlawed phosphate detergents,
people who'd never cared before drove to the next county in order
to buy huge loads of phosphate detergent, and surveys showed that
they rated phosphate detergents as gentler and more effective and
even easier-pouring... and if you give two-year-olds a choice
between a toy in the open and one protected by a barrier they can
go around, they'll ignore the toy in the open and go for the one
behind the barrier... salespeople know that they can sell things
just by telling the customer it might not be available... it was
all in Cialdini's book</em> Influence, <em>everything you're
feeling right now, the grass is always greener on the side that's
not allowed.</em></p>
<p>If Harry hadn't been told that he couldn't leave, he probably
would've <em>jumped</em> at the chance to stay at Hogwarts over the
summer...</p>
<p>...but not the rest of his life.</p>
<p>That was sort of the problem, really.</p>
<p>Who knew whether there <em>was</em> still a Dark Lord Voldemort
for him to defeat?</p>
<p>Who knew whether He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named still existed outside
of the imagination of a possibly-not-just-pretending-to-be-crazy
old wizard?</p>
<p>Lord Voldemort's body had been found burned to a crisp, there
couldn't really be such things as souls. How could Lord Voldemort
still be alive? How did Dumbledore <em>know</em> that he was
alive?</p>
<p>And if there wasn't a Dark Lord, Harry couldn't defeat him, and
he would be trapped in Hogwarts forever.</p>
<p>...maybe he would be legally allowed to escape after he
graduated his seventh year, six years and four months and three
weeks from now. It wasn't <em>that</em> long as lengths of time
went, it only <em>seemed</em> like long enough for protons to
decay.</p>
<p>Only it wasn't <em>just</em> that.</p>
<p>It wasn't <em>just</em> Harry's freedom that was at stake.</p>
<p>The Headmaster of Hogwarts, the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot,
the Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards,
was quietly sounding the alarm.</p>
<p>A <em>false</em> alarm.</p>
<p>A false alarm which <em>Harry</em> had triggered.</p>
<p><em>You know,</em> said the part of him that refined his skills,
<em>didn't you sort of ponder, once, how every different profession
has a different way to be excellent, how an excellent teacher isn't
like an excellent plumber; but they all have in common certain
methods of not being stupid; and that one of the most important
such techniques is to face up to your little mistakes before they
turn into BIG mistakes?</em></p>
<p>...although this already seemed to qualify as a BIG mistake,
actually...</p>
<p><em>The point being,</em> said his inner monitor, <em>it's
getting worse literally by the minute. The way spies turn people
is, they get them to commit a little sin, and then they use the
little sin to blackmail them into a bigger sin, and then they use
THAT sin to make them do even bigger things and then the
blackmailer owns their soul.</em></p>
<p><em>Didn't you once think about how the person being
blackmailed, if they could foresee the whole path, would just
decide to take the punch on the first step, take the hit of
exposing that first sin? Didn't you decide that you would do that,
if anyone ever tried to blackmail you into doing something major in
order to conceal something little? Do you see the similarity here,
Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres?</em></p>
<p>Only it wasn't little, it already wasn't little, there would be
a lot of very powerful people extremely angry at Harry, not just
for the false alarm but for <em>freeing Bellatrix from
Azkaban,</em> if the Dark Lord <em>did</em> exist and did come
after him later, that war might already be lost -</p>
<p><em>You don't think they'll be impressed by your honesty and
rationality and foresight in stopping this before it snowballs even
further?</em></p>
<p>Harry did <em>not</em>, in fact, think this; and after a
moment's reflection, whichever part of himself he was talking to,
had to agree that this was absurdly optimistic.</p>
<p>His wandering feet took him near an open window, and Harry went
over, and leaned his arms on the ledge, and stared down at the
grounds of Hogwarts from high above.</p>
<p>Brown that was barren trees, yellow that was dead grass,
ice-colored ice that was frozen creeks and frozen streams...
whichever school official had dubbed it 'The Forbidden Forest'
really hadn't understood marketing, the name just made you want to
go there even more. The sun was sinking in the sky, for Harry had
been thinking for some hours now, thinking mostly the same thoughts
over and over, but with key differences each time, like his
thoughts were not going in circles, but climbing a spiral, or
descending it.</p>
<p>He still couldn't believe that he'd gone through the
<em>entire</em> thing with Azkaban - he'd switched off his Patronus
before it took all his life, he'd stunned an Auror, he'd figured
out how to hide Bella from the Dementors, he'd faced down twelve
Dementors and scared them away, he'd invented the rocket-assisted
broomstick, and ridden it - he'd gone through the <em>entire</em>
thing without ever <em>once</em> rallying himself by thinking,
<em>I have to do this... because... I promised Hermione I'd come
back from lunch!</em> It felt like an irrevocably missed
opportunity; like, having done it wrong <em>that</em> time, he
would never be able to get it <em>right</em> no matter what sort of
challenge he faced next time, or what promise he made. Because then
he would just be doing it awkwardly and deliberately to make up for
having missed it the <em>first</em> time around, instead of making
the heroic declarations he could've made if he'd remembered his
promise to Hermione. Like that one wrong turn was irrevocable, you
only got one chance, had to do it right on the first try...</p>
<p>He should've remembered that promise to Hermione <em>before</em>
going to Azkaban.</p>
<p>Why had he decided to do that, again?</p>
<p><em>My working hypothesis is that you're stupid,</em> said
Hufflepuff.</p>
<p><em>That is not a useful fault analysis,</em> thought Harry.</p>
<p><em>If you want a little more detail,</em> said Hufflepuff,
<em>the Defense Professor of Hogwarts was all like 'Let's get
Bellatrix Black out of Azkaban!' and you were like 'Okay!'</em></p>
<p><em>Hold on, THAT'S not fair -</em></p>
<p><em>Hey,</em> said Hufflepuff, <em>notice how, once you're all
the way up here, and the individual trees sort of blur together,
you can actually see the shape of the forest?</em></p>
<p>Why <em>had</em> he done it...?</p>
<p>Not because of any cost-benefit calculation, that was for sure.
He'd been too embarrassed to pull out a sheet of paper and start
calculating expected utilities, he'd worried that Professor
Quirrell would stop respecting him if he said no or even hesitated
too much to help a maiden in distress.</p>
<p>He'd thought, somewhere deep inside him, that if your mysterious
teacher offered you the first mission, the first chance, the call
to adventure, and you said <em>no</em>, then your mysterious
teacher walked away from you in disgust, and you never got another
chance to be a hero...</p>
<p>...yeah, that had been it. In retrospect, that had been it. He'd
gone and started thinking his life had a plot and here was a plot
twist, as opposed to, oh, say, here was a proposal to <em>break
Bellatrix Black out of Azkaban.</em> That had been the true and
original reason for the decision in the split second where it had
been made, his brain perceptually recognizing the narrative where
he said 'no' as dissonant. And when you thought about it, that
wasn't a rational way to make decisions. Professor Quirrell's
ulterior motive to obtain the last remains of Slytherin's lost
lore, before Bellatrix died and it was irrevocably forgotten,
seemed impressively sane by comparison; a benefit commensurate with
what had appeared at the time as a small risk.</p>
<p>It didn't seem fair, it didn't seem <em>fair</em>, that
<em>this</em> was what happened if he lost his grip on his
rationality for just a tiny fraction of a second, the tiny fraction
of a second required for his brain to decide to be more comfortable
with 'yes' arguments than 'no' arguments during the discussion that
had followed.</p>
<p>From high above, far enough above that the individual trees
blurred together, Harry stared out at the forest.</p>
<p>Harry <em>didn't</em> want to confess and ruin his reputation
forever and get everyone angry at him and maybe end up killed by
the Dark Lord later. He'd rather be trapped in Hogwarts for six
years than face that. That was how he felt. And so it was in fact
helpful, a relief, to be able to cling to a single decisive factor,
which was that if Harry confessed, Professor Quirrell would go to
Azkaban and die there.</p>
<p>(A catch, a break, a stutter in Harry's breathing.)</p>
<p>If you phrased it <em>that</em> way... why, you could even
pretend to be a hero, instead of a coward.</p>
<p>Harry lifted his eyes from the Forbidden Forest, looked up at
the clear blue forbidden sky.</p>
<p>Stared out the glass panes at the big bright burning thing, the
fluffy things, the mysterious endless blue in which they were
embedded, that strange new unknown place.</p>
<p>It... actually did help, it helped quite a lot, to think that
his own troubles were nothing compared to being in Azkaban. That
there were people in the world who were <em>really</em> in trouble
and Harry Potter was not one of them.</p>
<p>What was he going to do about Azkaban?</p>
<p>What was he going to do about magical Britain?</p>
<p>...which side was he on, now?</p>
<p>In the bright light of day, everything that Albus Dumbledore had
said certainly <em>sounded</em> a lot wiser than Professor
Quirrell. Better and brighter, more moral, more
<em>convenient,</em> wouldn't it be nice if it were true. And the
thing to remember was that Dumbledore believed things
<em>because</em> they sounded nice, but Professor Quirrell was the
one who was <em>sane</em>.</p>
<p>(Again the catch in his breathing, it happened each time he
thought of Professor Quirrell.)</p>
<p>But just because something sounded nice, didn't make it
<em>wrong,</em> either.</p>
<p>And if the Defense Professor <em>did</em> have a flaw in his
sanity, it was that his outlook on life was <em>too
negative.</em></p>
<p><em>Really?</em> inquired the part of Harry that had read
eighteen million experimental results about people being too
optimistic and overconfident. <em>Professor Quirrell is too
pessimistic? So pessimistic that his expectations routinely</em>
undershoot <em>reality? Stuff him and put him in a museum, he's
unique. Which one of you two planned the perfect crime, and</em>
then <em>put in all the error margin and fallbacks that ended up
saving your butt,</em> just in case <em>the perfect crime went
wrong? Hint hint, his name wasn't Harry Potter.</em></p>
<p>But "pessimistic" wasn't the correct word to describe Professor
Quirrell's problem - if a problem it truly was, and not the
superior wisdom of experience. But to Harry it looked like
Professor Quirrell was constantly interpreting everything in the
worst possible light. If you handed Professor Quirrell a glass that
was 90% full, he'd tell you that the 10% empty part proved that no
one <em>really</em> cared about water.</p>
<p>That was a very good analogy, now that Harry thought about it.
Not all of magical Britain was like Azkaban, that glass was well
over half full...</p>
<p>Harry stared up at the bright blue sky.</p>
<p>...although, <em>following</em> the analogy, if Azkaban existed,
then maybe it <em>did</em> prove that the 90% good part was there
for other reasons, people trying to <em>make a show of
kindness</em> as Professor Quirrell had put it. For if they were
truly kind they would not have made Azkaban, they would storm the
fortress to tear it down... wouldn't they?</p>
<p>Harry stared up at the bright blue sky. If you wanted to be a
rationalist you had to read an awful lot of papers on flaws in
human nature, and some of those flaws were innocent logical
failures, and some of them looked a lot darker.</p>
<p>Harry stared up at the bright blue sky, and thought of the
Milgram experiment.</p>
<p>Stanley Milgram had done it to investigate the causes of World
War II, to try to understand why the citizens of Germany had obeyed
Hitler.</p>
<p>So he had designed an experiment to investigate
<em>obedience,</em> to see if Germans were, for some reason, more
liable to obey harmful orders from authority figures.</p>
<p>First he'd run a pilot version of his experiment on American
subjects, as a control.</p>
<p>And afterward he hadn't bothered trying it in Germany.</p>
<p>Experimental apparatus: A series of 30 switches set in a
horizontal line, with labels starting at '15 volts' and going up to
'450 volts', with labels for each group of four switches. The first
group of four labeled 'Slight Shock', the sixth group labeled
'Extreme Intensity Shock', the seventh group labeled 'Danger:
Severe Shock', and the two last switches left over labeled just
'XXX'.</p>
<p>And an actor, a confederate of the experimenter, who had
appeared to the true subjects to be someone just like them: someone
who had answered the same ad for participants in an experiment on
learning, and who had lost a (rigged) lottery and been strapped
into a chair, along with the electrodes. The true experimental
subjects had been given a slight shock from the electrodes, just so
that they could see that it worked.</p>
<p>The true subject had been told that the experiment was on the
effects of punishment on learning and memory, and that part of the
test was to see if it made a difference what sort of person
administered the punishment; and that the person strapped to the
chair would try to memorize sets of word pairs, and that each time
the 'learner' got one wrong, the 'teacher' was to administer a
successively stronger shock.</p>
<p>At the 300-volt level, the actor would stop trying to call out
answers and begin kicking at the wall, after which the experimenter
would instruct the subjects to treat non-answers as wrong answers
and continue.</p>
<p>At the 315-volt level the pounding on the wall would be
repeated.</p>
<p>After that nothing would be heard.</p>
<p>If the subject objected or refused to press a switch, the
experimenter, maintaining an impassive demeanor and dressed in a
gray lab coat, would say 'Please continue', then 'The experiment
requires that you continue', then 'It is absolutely essential that
you continue', then 'You have no other choice, you <em>must</em> go
on'. If the fourth prod still didn't work, the experiment halted
there.</p>
<p>Before running the experiment, Milgram had described the
experimental setup, and then asked fourteen psychology seniors what
percentage of subjects <em>they</em> thought would go all the way
up to the 450-volt level, what percentage of subjects would press
the last of the two switches marked XXX, after the victim had
stopped responding.</p>
<p>The most pessimistic answer had been 3%.</p>
<p>The actual number had been 26 out of 40.</p>
<p>The subjects had sweated, groaned, stuttered, laughed nervously,
bitten their lips, dug their fingernails into their flesh. But at
the experimenter's prompting, they had, most of them, gone on
administering what they believed to be painful, dangerous, possibly
lethal electrical shocks. All the way to the end.</p>
<p>Harry could hear Professor Quirrell laughing, in his mind; the
Defense Professor's voice saying something along the lines of:
<em>Why, Mr. Potter, even I had not been so cynical; I knew men
would betray their most cherished principles for money and power,
but I did not realize that a stern look also sufficed.</em></p>
<p>It was dangerous, to try and guess at evolutionary psychology if
you weren't a professional evolutionary psychologist; but when
Harry had read about the Milgram experiment, the thought had
occurred to him that situations like this had probably arisen many
times in the ancestral environment, and that most potential
ancestors who'd tried to disobey Authority were dead. Or that they
had, at least, done less well for themselves than the obedient.
People <em>thought</em> themselves good and moral, but when push
came to shove, some switch flipped in their brain, and it was
suddenly a lot harder to heroically defy Authority than they
thought. Even if you could do it, it wouldn't be easy, it wouldn't
be some effortless display of heroism. You would tremble, your
voice would break, you would be afraid; would you be able to defy
Authority even then?</p>
<p>Harry blinked, then; because his brain had just made the
connection between Milgram's experiment and what Hermione had done
on her first day of Defense class, she'd refused to shoot a fellow
student, even when Authority had told her that she must, she had
trembled and been afraid but she had still refused. Harry had seen
that happen right in front of his own eyes and he still hadn't made
the connection until now...</p>
<p>Harry stared down at the reddening horizon, the Sun was sinking
lower, the sky fading, darkening, even if most of it was still
blue, soon it would turn to night. The gold and red colors of Sun
and sunset reminded him of Fawkes; and Harry wondered, for a
moment, if it must be a sad thing to be a phoenix, and call and cry
and scream without being heeded.</p>
<p>But Fawkes would never give up, as many times as he died he
would always be reborn, for Fawkes was a being of light and fire,
and despairing over Azkaban belonged to the darkness just as much
as did Azkaban itself.</p>
<p>If you were given a glass half-empty and half-full, then that
was the way reality was, that was the truth and it was so; but you
still had a choice of how to <em>feel</em> about it, whether you
would despair over the empty half or rejoice in the water that was
there.</p>
<p>Milgram had tried certain other variations on his test.</p>
<p>In the eighteenth experiment, the experimental subject had only
needed to call out the test words to the victim strapped into the
chair, and record the answers, while someone <em>else</em> pressed
the switches. It was the same apparent suffering, the same frantic
pounding followed by silence; but it wasn't <em>you</em> pressing
the switch. <em>You</em> just watched it happen, and read the
questions to the person being tortured.</p>
<p>37 of 40 subjects had continued their participation in that
experiment to the end, the 450-volt end marked 'XXX'.</p>
<p>And if you were Professor Quirrell, you might have decided to
feel cynical about that.</p>
<p>But 3 out of 40 subjects had <em>refused</em> to participate all
the way to the end.</p>
<p>The Hermiones.</p>
<p>They did exist, in the world, the people who wouldn't fire a
Simple Strike Hex at a fellow student even if the Defense Professor
ordered them to do it. The ones who had sheltered Gypsies and Jews
and homosexuals in their attics during the Holocaust, and sometimes
lost their lives for it.</p>
<p>And were those people from some other species than humanity? Did
they have some extra gear in their heads, some additional chunk of
neural circuitry, which lesser mortals did not possess? But that
was not likely, given the logic of sexual reproduction which said
that the genes for complex machinery would be scrambled beyond
repair, if they were not universal.</p>
<p>Whatever parts Hermione was made from, everyone had those same
parts inside them somewhere...</p>
<p>...well, that was a nice thought but it wasn't <em>strictly</em>
true, there was such a thing as literal brain damage, people could
<em>lose</em> genes and the complex machine could stop working,
there were sociopaths and psychopaths, people who lacked the gear
to care. Maybe Lord Voldemort had been born like that, or maybe he
had known good and yet still chosen evil; at this point it didn't
matter in the slightest. But a <em>supermajority</em> of the
population ought to be capable of learning to do what Hermione and
Holocaust resisters did.</p>
<p>The people who had been run through the Milgram experiment, who
had trembled and sweated and nervously laughed as they went all the
way to pressing the switches marked 'XXX', many of them had written
to thank Milgram, afterward, for what they had learned about
themselves. That, too, was part of the story, the legend of that
legendary experiment.</p>
<p>The Sun had almost sunk below the horizon now, a last golden tip
peeking above the faraway tops of trees.</p>
<p>Harry looked at it, that tip of Sun, his glasses were supposed
to be proof against UV so he ought to be able to look directly at
it without damaging his eyes.</p>
<p>Harry stared directly at it, that tiny fraction of the Light
that was not obscured and blocked and hidden, even if it was only 3
parts out of 40, the other 37 parts were there somewhere. The 7.5%
of the glass that was full, which proved that people really did
care about water, even if that force of caring within themselves
was too often defeated. If people truly didn't care, the glass
would have been truly empty. If everyone had been like You-Know-Who
inside, secretly cleverly selfish, there would have been no
resisters to the Holocaust at all.</p>
<p>Harry looked at the sunset, on the second day of the rest of his
life, and knew that he had switched sides.</p>
<p>Because he couldn't believe in it any more, he couldn't really,
not after going to Azkaban. He couldn't do what 37 out of 40 people
would vote for him to do. Everyone might have inside them what it
took to be Hermione, and someday they might learn; but
<em>someday</em> wasn't <em>now</em>, not here, not today, not in
the real world. If you were on the side of 3 out of 40 people then
you weren't a political majority, and Professor Quirrell had been
right, Harry would not bow his head in submission when that
happened.</p>
<p>There was a sort of awful appropriateness to it. You shouldn't
go to Azkaban and come back having not changed your mind about
anything important.</p>
<p><em>So is Professor Quirrell right, then?</em> asked Slytherin.
<em>Leaving out whether he's good or evil, is he</em> right?
<em>Are you, to them, whether they know it or not, their next Lord?
We'll just leave out the Dark part, that's him being cynical again.
But is it your intention now to rule? I've got to say, that makes
even</em> me <em>nervous.</em></p>
<p><em>Do you think you can be trusted with power?</em> said
Gryffindor. <em>Isn't there some sort of rule that people who want
power shouldn't have it? Maybe we should make Hermione the ruler
instead.<br></em></p>
<p><em>Do you think you're fit to run a society and not have it
collapse into total chaos inside of three weeks flat?</em> said
Hufflepuff. <em>Imagine how loudly Mum would scream if she'd heard
you'd been elected Prime Minister, now ask yourself, are you sure
she's wrong about that?</em></p>
<p><em>Actually,</em> said Ravenclaw, <em>I have to point out that
all this political stuff sounds overwhelmingly boring. How about if
we leave all the electioneering to Draco and stick to science? It's
what we're actually good at, and that's been known to improve the
human condition too, y'know.</em></p>
<p><em>Slow down,</em> thought Harry at his components, <em>we
don't have to decide everything right now. We're allowed to ponder
the problem as fully as possible before coming to a
solution.</em></p>
<p>The last part of the Sun sank below the horizon.</p>
<p>It was strange, this feeling of not quite knowing who you were,
which side you were on, of having <em>not already made up your
mind</em> about something as major as that, there was an unfamiliar
sensation of freedom in it...</p>
<p>And that reminded him of what Professor Quirrell had said to his
last question, which reminded him of Professor Quirrell, which made
it hard once more to breathe, started that burning sensation in
Harry's throat, sent his thoughts around that loop of the climbing
spiral once again.</p>
<p>Why was he so sad, now, whenever he thought of Professor
Quirrell? Harry was used to knowing himself, and he didn't know why
he felt so sad...</p>
<p>It felt like he'd lost Professor Quirrell forever, lost him in
Azkaban, that was how it felt. As surely as if the Defense
Professor had been eaten by Dementors, consumed in the empty
voids.</p>
<p><em>Lost him! Why did I lose him? Because he said Avada Kedavra
and there was in fact a perfectly good reason even though I didn't
see it for a couple of hours? Why can't things go back to the way
they were?</em></p>
<p>But then it hadn't <em>been</em> the Avada Kedavra. That might
have played a part in irreversibly collapsing a structure of
rationalizations and flinches and carefully not thinking about
certain things. But it hadn't been the Avada Kedavra, that hadn't
been the disturbing thing that Harry had seen.</p>
<p><em>What did I see...?</em></p>
<p>Harry looked at the fading sky.</p>
<p>He'd seen Professor Quirrell turn into a hardened criminal while
facing the Auror, and the apparent change of personalities had been
effortless, and complete.</p>
<p>Another woman had known the Defense Professor as 'Jeremy
Jaffe'.</p>
<p><em>How many different people are you, anyway?</em></p>
<p><em>I cannot say that I bothered keeping count.</em></p>
<p>You couldn't help but wonder...</p>
<p>...whether 'Professor Quirrell' was just one more name on the
list, just one more person that had been <em>turned into</em>, made
up in the service of some unguessable goal.</p>
<p>Harry would always be wondering now, every time he talked to
Professor Quirrell, if it was a mask, and what motive was behind
that mask. With every dry smile, Harry would be trying to see what
was pulling the levers on the lips.</p>
<p><em>Is that how other people will start thinking of me, if I get
too Slytherin? If I pull off too many plots, will I never be able
to smile at anyone again, without them wondering what I really mean
by it?</em></p>
<p>Maybe there was some way to restore a trust in surface
appearances and make a normal human relationship possible again,
but Harry couldn't think of what it might be.</p>
<p>That was how Harry had lost Professor Quirrell, not the person,
but the... connection...</p>
<p>Why did that hurt so much?</p>
<p>Why did it feel so lonely, now?</p>
<p>Surely there were other people, maybe better people, to trust
and befriend? Professor McGonagall, Professor Flitwick, Hermione,
Draco, not to mention Mum and Dad, it wasn't like Harry was
<em>alone...</em></p>
<p>Only...</p>
<p>A choking sensation grew in Harry's throat as he understood.</p>
<p>Only Professor McGonagall, Professor Flitwick, Hermione, Draco,
they all of them sometimes knew things that Harry didn't,
but...</p>
<p>They did not excel above Harry <em>within</em> his own sphere of
power; such genius as they possessed was not like his genius, and
his genius was not like theirs; he might look upon them as peers,
but not look <em>up</em> to them as his <em>superiors.</em></p>
<p>None of them had been, none of them could ever be...</p>
<p>Harry's mentor...</p>
<p>That was who Professor Quirrell had been.</p>
<p>That was who Harry had lost.</p>
<p>And the manner in which he had lost his first mentor might or
might not allow Harry to ever get him back. Maybe someday he would
know all Professor Quirrell's hidden purposes and the doubts
between them would go away; but even if that seemed possible, it
didn't seem very probable.</p>
<p>There was a gust of wind, outside Hogwarts, it bent the empty
trees, rippled the lake whose heart was still unfrozen, made a
whispering sound as it slid past the window that looked upon the
half-twilit world, and Harry's thoughts wandered outward for a
time.</p>
<p>Then returned inward again, to the next step of the spiral.</p>
<p><em>Why am I different from the other children my age?</em></p>
<p>If Professor Quirrell's answer to that had been an evasion, then
it was a very well-calculated one. Deep enough and complex enough,
sufficiently full of suggestions of hidden meaning, to serve as a
trap for a Ravenclaw who couldn't be diverted by less. Or maybe
Professor Quirrell had meant his answer honestly. Who knew what
motive might have pulled that lever on those lips?</p>
<p><em>I will say this much, Mr. Potter: You are already an
Occlumens, and I think you will become a perfect Occlumens before
long. Identity does not mean, to such as us, what it means to other
people. Anyone we can imagine, we can be; and the true difference
about you, Mr. Potter, is that you have an unusually good
imagination. A playwright must contain his characters, he must be
larger than them in order to enact them within his mind. To an
actor or spy or politician, the limit of his own diameter is the
limit of who he can pretend to be, the limit of which face he may
wear as a mask. But for such as you and I, anyone we can imagine,
we can</em> be, <em>in reality and not pretense.</em> <em>While you
imagined yourself a child, Mr. Potter, you</em> were <em>a child.
Yet there are other existences you could support, larger
existences, if you wished. Why are you so free, and so great in
your circumference, when other children your age are small and
constrained? Why can you imagine and</em> become <em>selves more
adult than a mere child of a playwright should be able to compose?
That I do not know, and I must not say what I guess. But what you
have, Mr. Potter, is freedom.</em></p>
<p>If that was a snow job it was one heck of a distracting one.</p>
<p>And the still more worrisome thought was that Professor Quirrell
hadn't <em>realized</em> how disturbed Harry would be, how
<em>wrong</em> that speech would sound to him, how much damage it
would do to his trust in Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>There ought to always be one real person who you <em>truly</em>
were, at the center of everything...</p>
<p>Harry stared out at the falling night, the gathering
darkness.</p>
<p>...right?</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>It was almost bedtime when Hermione heard the scattered intakes
of breath and looked up from her copy of <em>Beauxbatons: A
History</em> to see the missing boy, the boy who had been misplaced
at lunch that Sunday, whose dinner nonappearance had been
accompanied by rumors - and she hadn't believed them because they
were <em>completely ridiculous</em>, but she'd felt a little
queasiness inside - that he'd withdrawn from Hogwarts in order to
hunt down Bellatrix Black.</p>
<p>"<em>Harry!</em> " she shrieked, she didn't even realize that
she was talking directly to him for the first time in a week, or
notice how some other students started at the sound of her yelling
all the way across the Ravenclaw common room.</p>
<p>Harry's eyes had already lifted to her, he was already walking
toward her, so she stopped halfway out of her chair -</p>
<p>A few moments later, Harry was seated across from her, and he
was putting away his wand after casting a Quieting barrier around
them.</p>
<p>(And an awful lot of Ravenclaws were trying not to look like
they were watching.)</p>
<p>"Hey," Harry said. His voice wavered. "I missed you. You're...
going to talk to me again, now?"</p>
<p>Hermione nodded, she just nodded, she couldn't think of what to
say. She'd missed Harry too, but she was realizing, with a guilty
sort of feeling, that it might've been a lot worse for him. She had
other friends, Harry... it didn't feel <em>fair</em>, sometimes,
that Harry talked to only her like that, so that she <em>had</em>
to talk to him; but Harry had a look about him like unfair things
had been happening to <em>him</em>, too.</p>
<p>"What's been going <em>on?</em> " she said. "There's all sorts
of rumors. There were people saying you'd run off to fight
Bellatrix Black, there were people saying you'd run off to
<em>join</em> Bellatrix Black -" and <em>those</em> rumors had said
that Hermione had just made up the thing about the phoenix, and
she'd yelled that the whole Ravenclaw common room had seen it, so
then the next rumor had claimed she'd made up <em>that</em> part
too, which was stupidity of such an inconceivable level that it
left her <em>completely flabbergasted.</em></p>
<p>"I can't talk about it," Harry said in a bare whisper. "Can't
talk about a lot of it. I wish I could tell you everything," his
voice wavered, "but I can't... I guess, if it helps or anything,
I'm not going to lunch with Professor Quirrell any more..."</p>
<p>Harry put his hands over his face, then, covering his eyes.</p>
<p>Hermione felt the queasy feeling all through her stomach.</p>
<p>"Are you crying?" said Hermione.</p>
<p>"Yeah," said Harry, his voice sounding a little breathy. "I
don't want anyone else to see."</p>
<p>There was a little silence. Hermione wanted to help but she
didn't know what to do about a boy crying, and she didn't know what
was happening; she felt like huge things were happening around her
- no, around Harry - and if she knew what they were she would
probably be scared, or alarmed, or something, but she didn't know
anything.</p>
<p>"Did Professor Quirrell do something wrong?" she said at
last.</p>
<p>"That's not why I can't go to lunch with him any more," Harry
said, still in that bare whisper with his hands pressed over his
eyes. "That was the Headmaster's decision. But yeah, Professor
Quirrell said some things to me that made me trust him less, I
guess..." Harry's voice sounded very shaky. "I'm feeling kind of
alone right now."</p>
<p>Hermione put her hand on her cheek where Fawkes had touched her
yesterday. She'd kept thinking about that touch, over and over,
maybe because she <em>wanted</em> it to be important, to mean
something to her...</p>
<p>"Is there any way I can help?" she said.</p>
<p>"I want to do something normal," Harry said from behind his
hands. "Something very normal for first-year Hogwarts students.
Something eleven-year-olds and twelve-year-olds like us are
<em>supposed</em> to do. Like play a game of Exploding Snap or
something... I don't suppose you have the cards or know the rules
or anything like that?"</p>
<p>"Um... I <em>don't</em> know the rules, actually..." said
Hermione. "I know they <em>explode</em>."</p>
<p>"I don't suppose Gobstones?" said Harry.</p>
<p>"Don't know the rules and they <em>spit</em> at you. Those are
<em>boy</em> games, Harry!"</p>
<p>There was a pause. Harry ground his hands against his face to
wipe it, and then took his hands away; and then he was looking at
her, looking a little helpless. "Well," Harry said, "what
<em>do</em> wizards and witches our age do, when they play, you
know, the kind of pointless silly games we're <em>supposed</em> to
play at this age?"</p>
<p>"Hopscotch?" said Hermione. "Jump-rope? Unicorn attack?
<em>I</em> don't know, <em>I</em> read books!"</p>
<p>Harry started laughing, and Hermione started giggling along with
him even though she didn't know quite why, but it <em>was</em>
funny.</p>
<p>"I guess that helped a little," said Harry. "Actually I think it
helped more than playing Gobstones for an hour could've possibly
helped, so thanks for being you. And no matter what, I'm
<em>not</em> having anyone Obliviate everything I know about
calculus. I'd sooner die."</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " said Hermione. "Why - why would you
<em>ever</em> want to do <em>that?</em> "</p>
<p>Harry stood up from the table, and there was a rush of restored
background noise as his rise broke the Quieting Charm. "I'm a tad
sleepy so I'm going off to bed," Harry said, now his voice was
ordinary and wry, "I've got some lost time to make up for, but I'll
see you at breakfast, and then at Herbology, if that's all right.
Not to mention it wouldn't be fair to dump all my depression on
you. G'night, Hermione."</p>
<p>"Good night, Harry," she said, feeling very confused and
alarmed. "Pleasant dreams."</p>
<p>Harry stumbled a little as she said that, and then he continued
on toward the stairs that led to the first-year-boys' dorms.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry turned the Quieting Charm all the way up, on the head of
his bedboard, so that he wouldn't wake anyone else up if he
screamed.</p>
<p>Set his alarm to wake him up for breakfast (if he wasn't up
already by that hour, if indeed he slept at all).</p>
<p>Got into bed, laid down -</p>
<p>- felt the lump beneath his pillow.</p>
<p>Harry stared up at the canopy above his bed.</p>
<p>Hissed under his breath, "Oh, you've got to be kidding
me..."</p>
<p>It took a few seconds before Harry could muster the heart to sit
up in bed, pull the blanket over himself and his pillow to obscure
the deed from the other boys, cast a low-intensity <em>Lumos</em>
and see what was under his pillow.</p>
<p>There was a parchment, and a deck of playing cards.</p>
<p>The parchment read,</p>
<p><em>A little bird told me that Dumbledore has shut the door of
your cage.</em></p>
<p><em>I must admit, on this occasion, that Dumbledore may have a
point. Bellatrix Black is loosed upon the world once more, and that
is not good news for any good person. If I stood in Dumbledore's
place, I might well do the same.</em></p>
<p><em>But just in case... The Salem Witches' Institute in America
accepts boys as well, despite the name. They are good people and
would protect you even from Dumbledore, if you needed it. Britain
holds that you need Dumbledore's permission to emigrate to magical
America, but magical America disagrees. So in the final extremity,
get outside the wards of Hogwarts and tear in half the King of
Hearts from this deck of cards.</em></p>
<p><em>That you should resort to it only in the final extremity
goes without saying.</em></p>
<p><em>Be well, Harry Potter.</em></p>
<p><em>- Santa Claus</em></p>
<p>Harry stared down at the pack of cards.</p>
<p>It <em>couldn't</em> take him anywhere else, not right now,
portkeys didn't work here.</p>
<p>But he still felt unnerved about the prospect of picking it up,
even to hide it inside his trunk...</p>
<p>Well, he'd <em>already</em> picked up the parchment, which could
just as easily have been enchanted with a trap, if a trap was
involved.</p>
<p>But still.</p>
<p>"Wingardium Leviosa," Harry whispered, and Hovered the packet of
cards to lie next to where his alarm clock rested in a pocket of
the headboard. He'd deal with it tomorrow.</p>
<p>And then Harry lay back in bed, and closed his eyes, to dream
without any phoenix to protect him, and pay his reckoning.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>He came awake with a gasp of horror, not a scream, he'd yet to
scream this night, but his blanket was all tangled around him from
where his sleeping form had jerked as he dreamed of running, trying
to get away from the gaps in space that were pursuing him through a
corridor of metal lit by dim gaslight, an endlessly long corridor
of metal lit by dim gaslight, and he hadn't <em>known</em>, in the
dream, that touching those voids meant he would die horribly and
leave his still-breathing body empty behind him, all he'd known was
that he had to run and run and run from the wounds in the world
sliding after him -</p>
<p>Harry started to cry again, it wasn't for the horror of the
chase, it was that he'd run away while someone behind him was
screaming for help, screaming for him to come back and save her,
help her, she was being eaten, she was going to die, and in the
dream Harry had run away instead of helping her.</p>
<p><em>"DON'T GO!" The voice came in a scream from behind the metal
door. "No, no, no, don't go, don't take it away, don't don't don't
-"</em></p>
<p>Why had Fawkes ever rested on his shoulder? He'd walked away.
Fawkes should hate him.</p>
<p>Fawkes should hate Dumbledore. <em>He'd</em> walked away.</p>
<p>Fawkes should hate everyone -</p>
<p>The boy wasn't awake, wasn't dreaming, his thoughts were jumbled
and confused in the shadowlands that bordered sleep and waking,
unprotected by the safety rails that his aware mind imposed on
itself, the careful rules and censors. In that shadowland his brain
had woken up enough to think, but something else was too sleepy to
act; his thoughts ran free and wild, unconstrained by his
self-concept, his waking self's ideals of what he shouldn't think.
That was the freedom of his brain's dreams, as his self-concept
slept. Free to repeat, over and over, Harry's new worst
nightmare:</p>
<p><em>"No, I didn't mean it, please don't die!"</em></p>
<p><em>"No, I didn't mean it, please don't die!"</em></p>
<p><em>"No, I didn't mean it, please don't die!"</em></p>
<p>A rage grew in him alongside the self-loathing, a terrible hot
wrath / icy cold hatred, for the world which had done that to her /
for himself, and in his half-awake state Harry fantasized escapes,
fantasized ways out of the moral dilemma, he imagined himself
hovering above the vast triangular horror of Azkaban, and
whispering an incantation unlike any syllables that had ever been
heard before on Earth, whispers that echoed all the way across the
sky and were heard on the other side of the world, and there was a
blast of silver Patronus fire like a nuclear explosion that tore
apart all the Dementors in an instant and ripped apart the metal
walls of Azkaban, shattered the long corridors and all the dim
orange lights, and then a moment later his brain remembered that
there were people in there, and rewrote the half-dream fantasy to
show all the prisoners laughing as they flew away in flocks from
the burning wreck of Azkaban, the silver light restoring the flesh
to their limbs as they flew, and Harry started crying harder into
his pillow, because he couldn't do it, because he wasn't God -</p>
<p>He'd sworn upon his life and magic and his art as a rationalist,
he'd sworn by all he held sacred and all his happy memories, he'd
given his oath so now he had to do something, <em>had to do
something, had to DO SOMETHING -</em></p>
<p>Maybe it was pointless.</p>
<p>Maybe trying to follow rules was pointless.</p>
<p>Maybe you just burned down Azkaban however.</p>
<p>And in fact he'd sworn he'd do it, so now that was what he had
to do.</p>
<p>He'd just do whatever it took to get rid of Azkaban, that was
all. If that meant ruling Britain, fine, if that meant finding a
spell to whisper that would echo all across the sky, whatever, the
important thing was to destroy Azkaban.</p>
<p>That was the side he was on, that was who he was, so there, it
was done.</p>
<p>His waking mind would have demanded a lot more details before
accepting that as an answer, but in his half-dreaming state it felt
like enough of a resolution to let his tired mind fall truly asleep
again, and dream the next nightmare.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Final Aftermath:</em></p>
<p>She came awake with a gasp of horror, a disruption of her
breathing that left her feeling deprived of air and yet her lungs
didn't move, she woke up with an unvoiced scream on her lips and no
words, no words came forth, for she could not understand what she
had seen, <em>she could not understand what she had seen</em>, it
was too large for her to encompass and still taking shape, she
could not put words to that formless shape and so she could not
discharge it, could not discharge it and become innocent and
unknowing once more.</p>
<p>"What time is it?" she whispered.</p>
<p>Her golden jeweled alarm clock, the beautiful and magical and
expensive alarm clock that the Headmaster had given her as a gift
upon her employment at Hogwarts, whispered back, "Around two in the
morning. Go back to sleep."</p>
<p>Her sheets were soaked in sweat, her nightclothes soaked in
sweat, she took her wand from beside the pillow and cleaned herself
up before she tried to go back to sleep, she tried to go back to
sleep and eventually succeeded.</p>
<p>Sybill Trelawney went back to sleep.</p>

<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 68: Self Actualization, Pt
3<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>Hermione wasn't feeling very nice right now, or Good either,
there was a hot ball of anger burning inside her and she wondered
if this was something like Harry's darkness (though it probably
wasn't even close) and she shouldn't have felt that way over some
silly little game but -</p>
<p>Her whole army. Two soldiers had beaten her whole army. That was
what she'd been told after she woke up.</p>
<p>It was a little too much.</p>
<p>"Well," Professor Quirrell said. From up close the Defense
Professor didn't look quite as healthy as he had the last time
she'd been in his office; his skin looked paler, and he moved a
little slower. His expression was as stern as ever, and his gaze as
penetrating; his fingers tapped sharply on his desk, rap-rap. "I
would guess that of the three of you, only Mr. Malfoy has guessed
why I've asked you here."</p>
<p>"Something to do with Noble and Most Ancient Houses?" said Harry
from beside her, sounding puzzled. "I didn't violate some kind of
crazy law by firing on Daphne, did I?"</p>
<p>"Not quite," the man said with heavy irony. "Since Miss
Greengrass did not invoke the correct dueling forms, she is not
entitled to demand that you be stripped of your House name.
Although of course I would not have permitted a formal duel. Wars
do not respect such rules." The Defense Professor leaned forward
and rested his chin on steepled hands, as though sitting upright
had already tired him. His eyes gazed at them, sharp and dangerous.
"General Malfoy. Why did I call you here?"</p>
<p>"General Potter against the two of us isn't a fair fight
anymore," Draco Malfoy said in a quiet voice.</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " blurted Hermione. "We almost <em>had</em>
them, if Daphne hadn't fainted -"</p>
<p>"Miss Greengrass did not faint from magical exhaustion,"
Professor Quirrell said dryly. "Mr. Potter shot her in the back
with a Sleep Hex while your soldiers were distracted by the sight
of their general flying into a wall. But congratulations
nonetheless, Miss Granger, on <em>almost</em> defeating two Chaotic
Legionnaires with a mere twenty-four Sunshine Soldiers."</p>
<p>The blood flaming in her cheeks grew a little hotter. "That -
that was just - if I'd only figured out he was wearing armor -"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell gazed at her from over touched fingers. "Of
course there are ways you <em>could</em> have won, Miss Granger.
There always are, in every lost battle. The world around us redunds
with opportunities, explodes with opportunities, which nearly all
folk ignore because it would require them to violate a habit of
thought; in every battle a thousand Hufflepuff bones waiting to be
sharpened into spears. If you had thought to try a massed
<em>Finite Incantatem</em> on general principles, you would have
dispelled Mr. Potter's suit of chainmail and everything else he was
wearing except his underwear, which leads me to suspect that Mr.
Potter did not quite realize his own vulnerability. Or you could
have had your soldiers swarm Mr. Potter and Mr. Longbottom and
physically wrest the wands from their hands. Mr. Malfoy's own
response was not what I would term <em>well-reasoned,</em> but at
least he did not wholly ignore his thousand alternatives." A
sardonic smile. "But you, Miss Granger, had the misfortune to
remember how to cast the Stunning Hex, and so you did not search
your excellent memory for a dozen easier spells that might have
proved efficacious. And you pinned all your army's hopes on your
own person, so they lost spirit when you fell. Afterward they
continued to cast their futile Sleep Hexes, governed by the habits
of fighting that had been trained into them, unable to break the
pattern as Mr. Malfoy did. I cannot quite comprehend what goes
through people's minds when they repeat the same failed strategy
over and over, but apparently it is an astonishingly rare
realization that you can try something else. And so the Sunshine
Regiment was wiped out by two soldiers." The Defense Professor
grinned mirthlessly. "One perceives certain similarities to how
fifty Death Eaters dominated all of magical Britain, and how our
much-loved Ministry continues in its rule."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor sighed. "<em>Nonetheless,</em> Miss
Granger, the fact remains that this is not the first such defeat
for you. In the previous battle, you and Mr. Malfoy united your
forces, and yet you were fought to a standstill, so that you and
Mr. Malfoy had to pursue Mr. Potter onto the roof. The Chaos Legion
has now demonstrated, twice in succession, military strength equal
to both other armies combined. This leaves me no choice. General
Potter, you will select eight soldiers from your army, including at
least one Chaotic Lieutenant, to be divided among Dragon Army and
the Sunshine Regiment -"</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " Hermione burst out again, she glanced over at
the other generals and saw that Harry looked as shocked as her,
while Draco Malfoy only looked resigned.</p>
<p>"General Potter is stronger than both of you together,"
Professor Quirrell said with calm precision. "Your contest is over,
he has won, and it is time to rebalance the three armies to present
him with a renewed challenge."</p>
<p>"<em>Professor Quirrell!</em> " said Harry. "I didn't -"</p>
<p>"This is my decision as the Professor of Battle Magic at the
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and it is not subject to
negotiation." The words were still precise, but the look in
Professor Quirrell's eyes chilled Hermione's blood, even though he
was glaring at Harry and not at her. "And I find it
<em>suspicious</em>, Mr. Potter, that the moment you wished to
isolate Miss Granger and Mr. Malfoy and force them to chase you
onto the roof, you were able to annihilate just exactly as much of
their united force as you pleased. Indeed, that is the level of
performance I <em>expected</em> of you since the start of this
year, and I am <em>annoyed</em> to discover that you have been
holding back in my classes this entire time! I have seen what you
can truly do, Mr. Potter. You are far beyond the point where Mr.
Malfoy or Miss Granger can fight you on an equal level, and you
will not be permitted to pretend otherwise. This, Mr. Potter, I
tell you in my capacity as your professor: For you to learn to your
full potential, you must exercise your full abilities and not hold
back for <em>any</em> reason - particularly not childish frets over
what your friends might think!"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>She left the Defense Professor's office with a larger army, and
less dignity, and feeling a lot like a sad little bug that had just
been squished, and trying very very hard not to cry.</p>
<p>"I <em>wasn't</em> holding back!" Harry said as soon as they
turned the first corner away from Professor Quirrell's office, the
moment the wooden door faded out of sight behind the stone walls.
"I wasn't pretending, I never <em>let</em> either of you win!"</p>
<p>She didn't answer, couldn't answer, it would all break loose if
she tried to say a word.</p>
<p>"Really?" said Draco Malfoy. The Dragon General still had that
air of resignation. "Because Quirrell's right, you know, it's
<em>suspicious</em> that you could beat nearly everyone in both our
armies as soon as you wanted to make us chase you onto the roof.
And didn't you say something then, Potter, about us needing to beat
you when you were fighting for real?"</p>
<p>The burning sensation was creeping up her throat, and when it
reached her eyes she would burst into tears, and from then on she
would be just a crying little girl to both of them.</p>
<p>"That -" Harry's voice said urgently, she wasn't looking at him
but his voice sounded like he had his head turned toward her. "That
was - I tried a lot harder that time, there was an important
reason, I <em>had</em> to, so I used a whole bunch of tricks I'd
been saving up - and -"</p>
<p>She'd always been trying her hardest, every time.</p>
<p>"- and I, I let out a side of myself I wouldn't usually use for
something like Defense class -"</p>
<p>So if she ever got close to winning against Harry when it
<em>really</em> mattered, he could just go into his dark side and
crush her, was that it?</p>
<p>...of course it was. She couldn't even <em>look</em> Harry in
the eyes when he was being scary, how had she ever thought she
could beat him for real?</p>
<p>The corridor forked, and Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy went left
toward a staircase that climbed to the second floor, and she went
right instead, she didn't even know where that passage went but
right now she'd rather be lost in the castle.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, Draco," said Harry's voice, and then there was a
pattering of footsteps behind her.</p>
<p>"Leave me alone," she said, it came out sounding stern but then
she had to shut her mouth and press her lips together tightly and
hold her breath to stop it all from coming out.</p>
<p>That boy just kept on coming, and ran around her and put himself
in front of her, because he was stupid that was why, and Harry
said, his voice now a high and desperate whisper, "I didn't run
away when <em>you</em> were beating <em>me</em> in all my classes
except broomstick riding!"</p>
<p>He didn't understand, and he would never understand, Harry
Potter would never understand, because no matter what contest he
lost he would still be the Boy-Who-Lived, if you were Harry Potter
and Hermione Granger was beating you then it meant everyone was
expecting you to rise to the challenge, if you were Hermione
Granger and Harry Potter was beating you that meant you were just
no one.</p>
<p>"It's not fair," she said, her voice was shaking but she wasn't
crying yet, not yet, "<em>I</em> shouldn't have to fight your dark
side, I'm just - I'm only -" <em>I'm only twelve,</em> that was
what she thought then.</p>
<p>"I only used my dark side <em>once</em> and that was - when I
<em>had</em> to!"</p>
<p>"So today you beat my <em>whole army</em> being just Harry?" She
still wasn't crying yet, and she wondered what her face looked like
right now, if she looked like an angry Hermione or a sad one.</p>
<p>"I -" Harry said. His voice got a little lower, "I wasn't...
really <em>expecting</em> to win, that time, I know I said I was
invincible but that was just to try to scare you, I really just
thought we'd slow you down for a bit -"</p>
<p>She started walking again, walked right past him, and as she
passed Harry's face tightened up like <em>he</em> was going to
cry.</p>
<p>"Is Professor Quirrell right?" came a high desperate whisper
from behind her. "If I have you for a friend, will I always be
afraid to do better because I know it will hurt your feelings?
That's not fair, Hermione!"</p>
<p>She took a breath and held it and ran, her feet pattering across
the stone as fast as they could, running as fast as she dared with
her vision all blurry, ran so that no one would hear her, and this
time Harry didn't follow.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Minerva was going over the Transfiguration parchment due Monday,
and had just marked down to negative two hundred points a
fifth-year parchment with an error that could have potentially
killed someone. During her first year as a professor she'd been
indignant at the folly of older students, now she was just
resigned. Some people not only never learned, they never noticed
that they were hopeless, they stayed bright and eager and kept on
trying. Sometimes they believed you when you told them, before they
left Hogwarts, that they must <em>never</em> try anything unusual,
give up free Transfiguration and use the art only through
established Charms; and sometimes... they didn't.</p>
<p>She was in the middle of trying to unravel a particularly
convoluted answer when a knock at the door disrupted her thoughts;
and it wasn't her office hours, but it had only taken a very short
time as Head of Gryffindor House for her to learn to suspend
judgment. You could always deduct House points
<em>afterward.</em></p>
<p>"Come in," she said in a crisp voice.</p>
<p>The young girl who entered her office had clearly been crying,
and then afterward had washed her face in hopes it wouldn't show
-</p>
<p>"Miss Granger!" said Professor McGonagall. It had taken her a
moment to recognize that face with its eyes reddened and cheeks
puffed. "What happened?"</p>
<p>"Professor," said the young girl in a wavering voice, "you said
that if I was ever worried or uncomfortable about anything, I
should come to you at once -"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Professor McGonagall, "now what
<em>happened?</em> "</p>
<p>The girl started to explain -</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Hermione stood still and the stairs turned around her, a
revolving helix that shouldn't have taken her anywhere at all, and
instead bore her continuously <em>upward.</em> Hermione thought it
seemed like the Enchantment of the Endless Stair, which had been
invented in 1733 by the wizard Arram Sabeti who'd lived on top of
Mount Everest in the days when no Muggles could climb it. Only that
couldn't be right because Hogwarts was much older - maybe the
enchantment had been <em>re</em>invented?</p>
<p>She should've been frightened, should've been nervous about her
second meeting with the Headmaster.</p>
<p>She <em>was</em>, in fact, frightened and nervous about her
second meeting with the Headmaster.</p>
<p>Only Hermione Granger had been thinking; she'd been thinking a
lot, after she hadn't been able to run any further and had slid
down against the wall with her lungs on fire, thinking while she
curled up in a ball with her back against the chilly stone wall and
her legs drawn up and crying.</p>
<p>Even if she lost to Harry Potter she was never, ever going to
lose to Draco Malfoy, that was just totally <em>absolutely</em>
unacceptable, and Professor Quirrell had praised General Malfoy for
not ignoring his thousand alternatives; and so after Hermione had
cried herself out she'd thought of fourteen other spells she
<em>should've</em> tried against Harry and Neville, and then she'd
started wondering if she might be making the same sort of mistake
about other things; and that was how she'd ended up knocking on
Professor McGonagall's door. Not asking for help, right now
Hermione didn't have any plans she could ask for help
<em>with,</em> just telling Professor McGonagall everything,
because when she'd thought of it that had seemed like one of the
thousand alternatives that Professor Quirrell had been talking
about.</p>
<p>And she'd told Professor McGonagall about how Harry Potter had
changed since the day the phoenix had been on his shoulder, and
about how people more and more seemed to see her as just something
of Harry's, and how it seemed like Harry was pulling farther and
farther away from everyone else in their school year and went
around with a sad air sometimes like he was losing something, and
<em>she didn't know what to do anymore.</em></p>
<p>And Professor McGonagall had told her that they needed to talk
to the Headmaster.</p>
<p>And Hermione had felt worried, but then the thought had come to
her that <em>Harry Potter</em> wouldn't have been scared of the
Headmaster. Harry Potter would have just barged ahead doing
whatever he was trying to do. Maybe (the thought had come to her)
it was worth <em>trying</em> to be like that, <em>not</em> being
scared, just doing whatever, and seeing what happened to her, it
couldn't really be worse.</p>
<p>The Endless Stair stopped turning.</p>
<p>The great oaken door in front of them with the brass griffin
knocker opened without being touched.</p>
<p>Behind a black oaken desk with dozens of drawers facing in every
direction, looking like it had drawers set <em>inside</em> other
drawers, was the silver-bearded Headmaster of Hogwarts upon his
throne, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, into whose gently
twinkling eyes Hermione looked for around three seconds before she
was distracted by all the other things in the room.</p>
<p>Some time later - she wasn't sure how long but it was while she
was trying to count the number of things in the room for the third
time and <em>still</em> not getting the same answer, even though
her memory insisted that nothing had been added or removed - the
Headmaster cleared his throat and said, "Miss Granger?"</p>
<p>Hermione's head snapped around, and she felt a little heat in
her cheeks; but Dumbledore didn't appear annoyed with her at all,
only serene, and with an inquiring look in those mild, half-glassed
eyes.</p>
<p>"Hermione," said Professor McGonagall, the older witch's voice
was gentle and her hand rested reassuringly on Hermione's shoulder,
"please tell the Headmaster what you said to me about Harry."</p>
<p>Hermione began speaking, despite her newfound resolution her
voice still stumbled a little with nervousness, as she described
how Harry had changed in the last few weeks since Fawkes had been
on his shoulder.</p>
<p>When she was done there was a pause, and then the Headmaster
sighed. "I am sorry, Hermione Granger," said Dumbledore. Those blue
eyes had grown sadder as she spoke. "That is... unfortunate, but I
cannot say it is unexpected. That is a hero's burden, which you
see."</p>
<p>"A <em>hero?</em> " said Hermione. She looked up nervously at
Professor McGonagall and saw that the Transfiguration Professor's
face had grown tight, though her hand still squeezed Hermione's
shoulder reassuringly.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Dumbledore. "I was a hero myself once, before I was
a mysterious old wizard, in the days when I opposed Grindelwald.
You have read history books, Miss Granger?"</p>
<p>Hermione nodded.</p>
<p>"Well," said Dumbledore, "that is what heroes have to do, Miss
Granger, they have their tasks and they must grow strong to
accomplish them, and that is what you see happening to Harry. If
there is anything that can be done to gentle his pathway, then
<em>you</em> will be the one to do it, and not I. For I am not
Harry's friend, alas, but only his mysterious old wizard."</p>
<p>"I -" said Hermione. "I'm not sure - I still want to be -" Her
voice stopped, it seemed too awful to say aloud.</p>
<p>Dumbledore closed his eyes, and when he opened them, he looked a
little older than before. "No one can stop you, Miss Granger, if
you choose to stop being Harry's friend. As for what it would do to
him, you may know that better than I."</p>
<p>"That - doesn't seem <em>fair,</em>" Hermione said, her voice
trembling. "That I've <em>got</em> to be Harry's friend because
he's got no one else? That doesn't seem fair."</p>
<p>"<em>Being</em> a friend is not something you can be forced to,
Miss Granger." The blue eyes seemed to look right through her. "The
feelings are there, or they are not. If they are there, you can
accept them or deny them. You <em>are</em> Harry's friend - and
choosing to deny it would wound him terribly, perhaps beyond
healing. But Miss Granger, what would drive you to such
extremes?"</p>
<p>She couldn't find words. She'd never been able to find words.
"If you get too near Harry - you get <em>swallowed up,</em> and no
one sees <em>you</em> any more, you're just something of
<em>his,</em> everyone thinks the whole world revolves around him
and..." She didn't have the words.</p>
<p>The old wizard nodded slowly. "It is indeed an unjust world we
live in, Miss Granger. All the world now knows that it is I who
defeated Grindelwald, and fewer remember Elizabeth Beckett who died
opening the way so I could pass through. And yet she is remembered.
Harry Potter <em>is</em> the hero of this play, Miss Granger; the
world <em>does</em> revolve around him. He is destined for great
things; and I ween that in time the name of Albus Dumbledore will
be remembered as Harry Potter's mysterious old wizard, more than
for anything else I have done. And perhaps the name of Hermione
Granger will be remembered as his companion, if you prove worthy of
it in your day. For this I tell you true: never will you find more
glory on your own, than in Harry Potter's company."</p>
<p>Hermione shook her head rapidly. "But that's <em>not</em> -"
She'd known she wouldn't be able to explain. "It's not about
<em>glory,</em> it's about being - something that belongs to
someone else!"</p>
<p>"So you think you would rather be the hero?" The old wizard
sighed. "Miss Granger, I have <em>been</em> a hero, and a leader;
and I would have been a thousand times happier if I could have
belonged to someone like Harry Potter. Someone made of sterner
stuff than I, to make the hard decisions, and yet worthy to lead
me. I thought, once, that I knew such a man, but I was mistaken...
Miss Granger, you have no idea at <em>all</em> how fortunate are
those like you, compared to heroes."</p>
<p>The hot burning feeling was creeping up her throat again, along
with helplessness, she didn't understand why Professor McGonagall
had brought her here if the Headmaster wasn't going to help, and
from a glance at Professor McGonagall's face, it looked like
Professor McGonagall also wasn't sure now that it had been a good
idea.</p>
<p>"I don't want to be a hero," said Hermione Granger, "I don't
want to be a hero's companion, I just want to be <em>me.</em>"</p>
<p>(The thought came to her a few seconds later that maybe she
<em>did</em> in fact want to be a hero, but she decided not to
change what she'd said.)</p>
<p>"Ah," said the old wizard. "That is a tall order, Miss Granger."
Dumbledore rose from his throne, stepped out behind his desk, and
pointed to a symbol on the wall, so ubiquitous that Hermione's eyes
had glossed right over it; a faded shield on which was inscribed
the heraldry of Hogwarts, the lion and snake, and badger and raven,
and in Latin engraved words whose point she'd never understood.
Then, as she realized where that shield was, and how old it looked,
it suddenly occurred to Hermione that this might be the
<em>original</em> -</p>
<p>"A Hufflepuff would say," said Dumbledore, tapping his finger on
the faded badger and making Hermione wince for the sacrilege (if it
<em>was</em> the original), "that people fail to become who they
are meant to be, because they are too lazy to put in all the work
involved. A Ravenclaw," tapping the raven, "would repeat those
words that the wise know to be far older than Socrates, <em>know
thyself,</em> and say that people fail to become who they are meant
to be, through ignorance and lack of thought. And Salazar
Slytherin," Dumbledore frowned as his finger tapped the faded
snake, "why, he said that we become who we are meant to be by
following our desires wherever they lead. Perhaps he would say that
people fail to become themselves because they refuse to do what is
necessary to achieve their ambitions. But then one notes that
nearly all of the Dark Wizards to come out of Hogwarts have been
Slytherins. Did they become what they were meant to be? I think
not." Dumbledore's finger tapped the lion, and then he turned
toward her. "Tell me, Miss Granger, what would a Gryffindor say? I
do not need to ask whether the Sorting Hat offered you that
House."</p>
<p>It didn't seem like a hard question. "A Gryffindor would say
that people don't become who they should be, because they're
afraid."</p>
<p>"Most people <em>are</em> afraid, Miss Granger," said the old
wizard. "They live their whole lives circumscribed by crippling
fear that cuts off everything they might accomplish, everything
they might become. Fear of saying or doing the wrong thing, fear of
losing their mere possessions, fear of death, and above all the
fear of what other people will think of them. Such fear is a most
terrible thing, Miss Granger, and it is terribly important to know
that. But it is not what Godric Gryffindor would have said. People
become who they are meant to be, Miss Granger, by doing what is
right." The old wizard's voice was gentle. "So tell me, Miss
Granger, what seems to you like the <em>right</em> choice? For
<em>that</em> is who you truly are, and wherever that path leads,
that is who you are meant to become."</p>
<p>There was a long space filled with the sounds of things that
could not be counted.</p>
<p>She thought about it, because she was a Ravenclaw.</p>
<p>"I don't <em>think</em> it's right," Hermione said slowly, "for
someone to have to live inside someone else's shadow like
that..."</p>
<p>"Many things in the world are not right," said the old wizard,
"the question is what is right for <em>you</em> to do about them.
Hermione Granger, I shall be less subtle than is usual for a
mysterious old wizard, and tell you outright that you cannot
<em>imagine</em> how badly things could go if the events
surrounding Harry Potter turn to ill. His quest is a matter you
would not even <em>dream</em> of walking away from, if you
knew."</p>
<p>"<em>What</em> quest?" said Hermione. Her voice was trembling,
because it was very clear what answer the Headmaster was looking
for and she didn't want to give it. "What <em>happened</em> to
Harry back then, <em>why</em> was Fawkes on his shoulder?"</p>
<p>"He grew up," said the old wizard. His eyes blinked several
times, beneath the half-moon glasses, and his face suddenly looked
very lined. "You see, Miss Granger, people do not grow up because
of time, people grow up when they are placed in grownup situations.
That is what happened to Harry Potter that Saturday. He was told -
you are not to share this information with anyone, you understand -
he was told that he would have to fight someone. I cannot tell you
who. I cannot tell you why. But that is what happened to him, and
why he needs his friends."</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>"<em>Bellatrix Black?</em> " Hermione said. She couldn't have
been more shocked if someone had plugged an electrical cord into
her ear. "You're going to make Harry fight <em>Bellatrix
Black?</em> "</p>
<p>"No," said the old wizard. "Not her. I cannot tell you who, or
why."</p>
<p>She thought about it some more.</p>
<p>"Is there any way I can <em>keep up</em> with Harry?" said
Hermione. "I mean, I'm not saying it's what I'll <em>do</em>, but -
if he needs friends then can we be <em>equal</em> friends? Can I be
a hero too?"</p>
<p>"Ah," said the old wizard, and smiled. "Only you can decide
that, Miss Granger."</p>
<p>"But you're not going to help me like you're helping Harry."</p>
<p>The old wizard shook his head. "I have helped him little enough,
Miss Granger. And if you are asking me for a quest -" The old
wizard smiled again, rather wryly. "Miss Granger, you are in your
first year of Hogwarts. Do not be too eager to grow up; there will
be time enough for that later."</p>
<p>"I'm twelve. Harry's <em>eleven.</em>"</p>
<p>"Harry Potter is special," said the old wizard. "As you know,
Miss Granger." The blue eyes were suddenly piercing beneath the
half-moon glasses, and she was reminded of the day of the Dementor
when Dumbledore's voice had said, inside her mind, that he knew
about Harry's dark side.</p>
<p>Hermione put up her hand and touched Professor McGonagall's
hand, which had stayed strong on her shoulder this whole time, and
Hermione said, she was surprised that her voice didn't break, "I'd
like to go, now, please."</p>
<p>"Of course," said Professor McGonagall, and Hermione felt the
hand on her shoulder gently turning her around to face the oaken
door.</p>
<p>"Have you chosen your path yet, Hermione Granger?" said Albus
Dumbledore's voice from behind her, even as the door slowly creaked
open to reveal the Enchantment of the Endless Stair.</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>"And?"</p>
<p>"I'll," she said, her voice stuck, "I'll, I'll -"</p>
<p>She swallowed.</p>
<p>"I'll do - what's right -"</p>
<p>She didn't say anything else, she couldn't, and then the Endless
Stair began revolving around her once again.</p>
<p>Neither she nor Professor McGonagall spoke on the way down.</p>
<p>When the Flowing Stone gargoyles stepped out of their way, and
the two of them stepped out into the corridors of Hogwarts,
Professor McGonagall finally spoke, and she said in a whisper, "I'm
so terribly sorry, Miss Granger. I did not think the Headmaster
would say such things to you. I think he truly has forgotten what
it is like to be a child."</p>
<p>Hermione glanced back up to her and saw that Professor
McGonagall looked like <em>she</em> was about to burst into
tears... only not really, but there was a tightness in her face
that was like that.</p>
<p>"If I want to be a hero too," said Hermione, "if I've decided to
be a hero too, is there anything <em>you</em> can do to help?"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall rapidly shook her head, and said, "Miss
Granger, I'm not sure the Headmaster is wrong about <em>that.</em>
You <em>are</em> twelve."</p>
<p>"Okay," said Hermione.</p>
<p>They walked forward a bit.</p>
<p>"Excuse me," said Hermione, "is it okay if I walk back to the
Ravenclaw tower by myself? I'm sorry, it's not your fault or
anything, I just want to be by myself right now."</p>
<p>"Of course, Miss Granger," said Professor McGonagall, her voice
sounding a little hoarse, and Hermione heard her footsteps stop,
and then turn around behind her.</p>
<p>Hermione Granger walked away.</p>
<p>She climbed a flight of stairs, and then another, wondering if
there was anyone else in Hogwarts who would give her a chance to be
a hero. Professor Flitwick would say the same thing as Professor
McGonagall, and even if he didn't, he probably couldn't help,
Hermione didn't know who <em>could</em> help. Well, Professor
Quirrell would come up with something clever if she used up enough
Quirrell points, but she had a feeling that asking him would be a
bad idea - that the Defense Professor couldn't help anyone become
the sort of hero that was worth becoming, and that he wouldn't even
understand the difference.</p>
<p>She had almost gotten to the Ravenclaw tower when she saw the
flash of gold.</p>
</div>
<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 69: Self Actualization, Pt
4<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>It was out of the corner of her eye that Hermione Granger saw
it, a reflection on the polished metal of a statue at the junction
of two corridors, a flash of gold, a flash of red, something like
an image of fire; just for a moment she saw it, and then it was
gone.</p>
<p>She paused, puzzled, and she <em>almost</em> walked away, but
there had been something familiar about that brief glow -</p>
<p>Hermione walked forward to where the statue had stood, looked at
the corridor from which she thought the fiery reflection might have
come.</p>
<p>Faintly, as though from a faraway place, she heard the cry, the
call.</p>
<p>Hermione started to run.</p>
<p>She ran for a while; whenever she got to a junction she would
pause, catch as much breath as she could, and then she would see a
flash of fire reflected from one direction or another, or hear that
distant call. If it hadn't been for her army training she would've
fallen over in exhaustion, running like that.</p>
<p>She never saw the phoenix.</p>
<p>And then she came to a four-way branch and there was
<em>nothing,</em> no sign, she waited for long seconds and she
heard no cry and saw no fire, and she was only just starting to
wonder with a sick sad feeling if she'd imagined the whole thing,
when she heard a <em>person</em> cry out.</p>
<p>When her rapidly racing feet turned the corner her mind took in
the whole scene at a glance, three huge boys in green-trimmed robes
already turning to look at her, and one shorter and smaller boy in
yellow, who was dangling in the air from one foot held up high by
an invisible hand.</p>
<p>The Sunshine General didn't even think about it, people who
stopped to think didn't spring very good ambushes.</p>
<p>Her wand was in her hand, her fingers did the twist and her lips
said "<em>Somnium!</em> " and the largest bully fell over, the
Hufflepuff boy dropped out of the air with a <em>thump</em> and the
other two bullies were trying to aim their wands at her and she
said "<em>Somnium!</em> " again and another huge boy keeled over -
the one who'd been aiming his wand faster, that was who she'd fired
at.</p>
<p>Unfortunately casting two Sleep Hexes in a row like that was
hard even for her, and she couldn't get off a third before -</p>
<p>The last bully shouted "<em>Protego!</em> " and was surrounded
by a shimmering blue glow.</p>
<p>Twenty-four hours ago, Hermione would have panicked at that, a
<em>real</em> Shielding Charm would let the bully-boy cast spells
on her even while he was protected.</p>
<p><em>Now</em> she -</p>
<p>"<em>Stupefy!</em> " shouted the bully-boy.</p>
<p>The crimson bolt blasted toward her with a terrible brilliance,
blazing far brighter than any hex that had sprung from Harry's
wand.</p>
<p>Hermione swayed slightly to the left, and the bolt missed,
because the bully's <em>aim</em> hadn't been nearly as good as
Harry's; and the thought came to her that maybe bullies and
Professor Quirrell's armies didn't mix.</p>
<p>"<em>Stupefy!</em> " shouted the bully-boy again.
"<em>Expelliarmus! Stupefy!</em> "</p>
<p>Anyway, <em>now</em> she'd just spent a whole hour thinking of
all the <em>other</em> spells she could've cast on Harry and
Neville -</p>
<p>"<em>Jellyfy!</em> " yelled the bully-boy, a wide-beam jinx with
no visible bolt to dodge, and her knees suddenly felt almost too
weak to support her. And then, with an angry roar producing an even
brighter blaze of crimson, "<em>Stupefy!</em> "</p>
<p>She dodged that one by deliberately falling, and by then she'd
recovered enough for her next spell, which was -</p>
<p>"<em>Glisseo,</em>" said Hermione, directing her remark to the
floor.</p>
<p>"Oof," said the bully-boy as his feet went out from under him
and <em>he actually dropped his wand.</em></p>
<p>The <em>Protego</em> winked out.</p>
<p>"<em>Somnium,</em>" said Hermione.</p>
<p>She was still breathing in gasps as she crawled over to where
the Hufflepuff boy was sitting up, and groaning and rubbing his
skull where he'd been dropped head-first into the floor; it was a
good thing he hadn't been a Muggle, Hermione realized, or he might
have snapped his neck. She hadn't actually thought of that.</p>
<p>"Uh," said the boy, his hair was of a color that would've been
called 'brunette' if he was a girl, his eyes an undistinguished
brown that somehow seemed just right for Hufflepuff, there weren't
any tears on his face but he looked sort of pale. She pegged him at
about fourth year, or third.</p>
<p>Then the brown eyes widened as he focused on her. "<em>General
Sunshine?</em> "</p>
<p>"Yeah," she said. "That's <em>(gasp)</em> me." If the Hufflepuff
boy said anything about her being Harry Potter's love interest, she
decided, he was going to die.</p>
<p>"Wow," said the Hufflepuff boy. "That was - you just - I mean I
saw you on the screens before Christmas but - wow! I can't believe
you just did that!"</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p><em>I can't believe I just did that,</em> thought Hermione
Granger, who was feeling a little faint all of a sudden, it must
have been all that running. "Excuse <em>(gasp)</em> me," she said,
"can you <em>(gasp)</em> Unjellyfy my legs?"</p>
<p>The boy nodded, pushed himself to his feet, and reached inside
his robes for his wand; but Hermione had to correct his gesture
before the counter-Jinx worked right.</p>
<p>"I'm Michael Hopkins," said the boy once Hermione had rolled
back to her own feet. He stuck out his hand. "Or just Mike inside
Hufflepuff, there aren't any other Mikes in all of Hufflepuff this
year, would you believe it?"</p>
<p>They shook hands, and Mike said, "Anyway, <em>thank
you.</em>"</p>
<p>Hermione wasn't prepared for the rush of euphoria that hit her
then, saving someone like that literally felt better than anything
she'd ever felt in her <em>whole life.</em></p>
<p>She turned to look at the bullies.</p>
<p>They were very big and they looked, she thought, around fifteen
years old, and she was suddenly realizing just how <em>large</em> a
difference had sprung up between Hogwarts students who'd signed up
for all of Professor Quirrell's extra-curricular activities, and
students who'd had years of being taught by the worst Professors
ever to go Professing. Being able to <em>hit</em> things that you
aimed at, for example; or being able to think well enough in the
middle of a fight to realize that you ought to <em>Innervate</em>
your fallen allies. And other things Professor Quirrell had said,
like that in the real world almost any fight would be settled by a
surprise attack, suddenly made a lot more sense to her.</p>
<p>Still trying to catch her breath, she looked back at Mike.</p>
<p>"Would you <em>(gasp)</em> believe," said Hermione Granger,
"that five minutes ago I was <em>(gasp)</em> having trouble
figuring out how to become a <em>(gasp)</em> hero?"</p>
<p>Had she really thought she needed <em>permission</em> from
someone, or that heroes sat around waiting for someone else to give
them quests? It was very simple actually, you just went where the
evil was, that was all it ever took to be a hero. She should've
remembered, she shouldn't have needed a phoenix to tell her, that
bad things sometimes happened right here in Hogwarts.</p>
<p>Then Hermione glanced nervously back at where the three older
boys were lying unconscious as the realization hit that they'd
<em>seen</em> her, they might <em>know</em> who she was, they might
sneak up on her and take <em>her</em> by surprise and - and they
could really hurt her -</p>
<p>Hermione stopped.</p>
<p>She remembered that Harry Potter had put himself in the middle
of <em>five</em> Slytherin bullies on the first day of class when
he hadn't even known how to use his wand.</p>
<p>She remembered the Headmaster saying that you grew up by being
put in grownup situations, and that most people lived their lives
inside a constraining circle of fear.</p>
<p>And she remembered Professor McGonagall's voice saying, 'You
<em>are</em> twelve.'</p>
<p>Hermione took a deep breath, once, twice, and three times.</p>
<p>She asked Mike if he needed to go to Madam Pomfrey's office,
which he didn't; and got him to tell her the names of the Slytherin
boys, just in case.</p>
<p>And then Hermione Granger strolled away from the heap of
unconscious bullies, making sure to put a smile on her face as she
walked.</p>
<p>She knew that she was probably going to get hurt sooner or
later. But if you were too scared of getting hurt to do what was
right, then you couldn't be a hero, it was as simple as that; and
if you'd put the Sorting Hat on her head at that moment it wouldn't
have waited even <em>one</em> <em>second</em> before calling out
'GRYFFINDOR!'</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>She was still thinking about it when she came down to dinner;
the euphoria of saving someone still hadn't worn off, and she was
beginning to worry that it had broken something in her brain.</p>
<p>As she approached the Ravenclaw table a sudden epidemic of
whispers broke out, and Hermione wondered if the Hufflepuff boy had
said anything yet before she realized that the whispers probably
weren't about <em>that.</em></p>
<p>She sat down across from Harry Potter who looked
<em>extremely</em> nervous, probably because she was still
smiling.</p>
<p>"Uh -" said Harry, as she served herself freshly toasted bread,
butter, cinnamon, no fruits or vegetables whatsoever, and three
helpings of chocolate brownies. "Uh -"</p>
<p>She let him go on like that until she'd finished pouring herself
a glass of grapefruit juice, and then she said, "I've got a
question for you, Mr. Potter. How do you think people fail to
become themselves?"</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " said Harry.</p>
<p>She looked at him. "Pretend there isn't all this stuff going
on," she said, "and just say whatever you'd have said
yesterday."</p>
<p>"Um..." Harry said, looking very confused and worried. "I think
we already <em>are</em> ourselves... it's not like I'm an imperfect
copy of someone else. But I guess if I try to run with the sense of
the question, then I'd say that people don't become themselves
because we absorb all this crazy stuff from the environment and
then regurgitate it. I mean, how many people playing Quidditch
would be playing a game like that if they'd invented the game
themselves? Or back in Muggle Britain, how many people who think of
themselves as Labour or Conservative or Liberal Democrat would
invent that exact bundle of political beliefs if they had to come
up with everything themselves?"</p>
<p>Hermione considered this. She'd been wondering if Harry would
say something Slytherin or maybe even Gryffindor, but this didn't
seem to fit into the Headmaster's list; and it occurred to Hermione
that there might be a lot more viewpoints on the subject than just
four.</p>
<p>"Okay," said Hermione, "different question. What makes someone a
hero?"</p>
<p>"A <em>hero?</em> " said Harry.</p>
<p>"Yeah," said Hermione.</p>
<p>"Ah..." Harry said. His fork and knife nervously sawed at a
piece of steak, cutting it into tinier and tinier pieces. "I think
a lot of people can do things when the world channels them into
it... like people are expecting you to do it, or it only uses
skills you already know, or there's an authority watching to catch
your mistakes and make sure you do your part. But problems like
that are probably already being solved, you know, and then there's
no need for heroes. So I think the people we call 'heroes' are rare
because they've got to make everything up as they go along, and
most people aren't comfortable with that. Why do you ask?" Harry's
fork stabbed three pieces of thoroughly shredded steak and lifted
them up to his mouth.</p>
<p>"Oh, I just stunned three older Slytherin bullies and rescued a
Hufflepuff," said Hermione. "I'm going to be a hero."</p>
<p>When Harry had finished choking on his food (some of the other
Ravenclaws in hearing distance were still coughing) he said,
"<em>What?</em> "</p>
<p>Hermione told the story, it began rippling out in further
whispers even as she spoke. (Though she left out the part about the
phoenix, because that seemed like a private thing between the two
of them. Hermione had felt surprised, thinking about it afterward,
that a phoenix would appear for someone who <em>wanted</em> to be a
hero; it seemed a bit selfish when she thought about it that way;
but maybe it didn't matter to phoenixes so long as they saw that
you were willing to help people.)</p>
<p>When she was done talking, Harry stared at her across the table
and didn't say a word.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry for how I acted earlier," Hermione said. She sipped
from her glass of grapefruit juice. "I should've remembered that if
I'm still beating the pants off you in Charms class then it's okay
for you to do better in Defense."</p>
<p>"<em>Please</em> don't take this the wrong way," said Harry. He
looked too-adult now, and grim. "But are you sure this is who
<em>you</em> are, and not, to put it bluntly, me?"</p>
<p>"I'm quite certain," said Hermione. "Why, my name practically
spells out 'heroine' except for the extra 'm', I never noticed that
until today."</p>
<p>"Being a hero isn't all fun and games," said Harry. "Not real
heroing, the sort grownups have to do, it isn't like this, it isn't
going to be this easy."</p>
<p>"I know," said Hermione.</p>
<p>"It's hard and it's painful and you've got to make decisions
where there isn't any good answer -"</p>
<p>"Yes, Harry, I read those books too."</p>
<p>"No," said Harry, "you don't understand, even if the books warn
you there's no way you <em>can</em> understand until -"</p>
<p>"That doesn't stop you," said Hermione. "It doesn't stop you
even a little. I bet you never even <em>considered</em> not being a
hero because of that. So why d'you think it'll stop me?"</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>A sudden huge smile lit Harry's face, a smile that was as bright
and as boyish as the frown had been grim and adult, and everything
was all right again between them.</p>
<p>"This is going to go horribly mind-bogglingly wrong somehow,"
said Harry, still smiling hugely. "You know that, right?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I know," said Hermione. She ate another bite of toast.
"That reminds me, Dumbledore refused to be my mysterious old
wizard, is there someplace I can write to get another one?"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Aftermath:</em></p>
<p>"...and Professor Flitwick says her determination seems
unshakeable," Minerva said tightly, staring at the silver-bearded
old wizard who was responsible for this. Albus Dumbledore was just
sitting silently and listening to her with a distant sad look in
his eyes. "Miss Granger didn't even blink when Professor Flitwick
threatened to have her transferred to Gryffindor, just said that if
she left she would take all the books with her. Hermione Granger
has decided she's going to be a hero and she's not taking no for an
answer. I doubt you could have pushed her into this any harder if
you had <em>tried</em> to -"</p>
<p>It took all of five full seconds for Minerva's brain to process
the realization.</p>
<p><em>"ALBUS!"</em> she shrieked.</p>
<p>"My dear," said the old wizard, "after you have dealt with your
thirtieth hero or so, you will realize that they react quite
predictably to certain things; such as being told that they are too
young, or that they are not destined to be heroes, or that being a
hero is unpleasant; and if you truly wish to be sure you should
tell them all three. Although," with a brief sigh, "it does not do
to be <em>too</em> blatant, or your Deputy Headmistress might catch
you."</p>
<p>"Albus," Minerva said, her voice even tighter, "if she is hurt,
I swear this time I'll -"</p>
<p>"She would have come to that same place in due time," Albus
said, the distant sad look still in his eyes. "If someone is meant
to become a hero then they will not listen to our warnings,
Minerva, no matter how hard we try. And given that, it is better
for Harry if Miss Granger does not fall too far behind him." Albus
produced, as though from nowhere, a tin which flipped open to
reveal small yellow lumps, she'd never been able to figure out
where he kept it and she'd never been able to detect the magic
involved. "Lemon drop?"</p>
<p>"<em>She is a twelve-year-old girl, Albus!</em> "</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Afteraftermath:</em></p>
<p>Within the windows, barely visible in the evening gloom, fishes
swam in the black waters; illuminated by the bright shine of the
Slytherin common room as they came closer, fading into darkness as
they swam away.</p>
<p>Daphne Greengrass was sitting in a comfortable black leather
couch, her head collapsed into her hands, glowing golden-yellowish
as bright sparks of white light winked in and out of existence
around her.</p>
<p>She'd been ready to be teased about liking Neville Longbottom.
She'd been expecting to hear a lot of snide remarks about
Hufflepuffs. She'd thought of whole <em>reams</em> of snappy
comebacks for it while she was on the way back to the Slytherin
dungeons.</p>
<p>She'd been looking <em>forward</em> to being teased about liking
Neville. Being teased about that sort of thing meant you'd grown up
into a real girl.</p>
<p>As it turned out, nobody had worked out that her challenging
Neville to a Most Ancient Duel meant that she liked him. She'd
thought it would be <em>obvious</em> but no, nobody else had even
thought of that apparently.</p>
<p>It was always the hex you didn't see that hit you.</p>
<p>She should've just called herself Daphne of Sunshine, like
Neville of Chaos. Or Sunny Daphne like Sunny Ron. Or
<em>anything</em> except Greengrass of Sunshine.</p>
<p>Greengrass of Sunshine.</p>
<p>It had gone from there to Greengrass of Sunshine and Blue
Skies.</p>
<p>Then someone had added Snow-Topped Mountains and Frolicking
Woodland Creatures.</p>
<p>Currently she was being referred to as the Sparkly Unicorn
Princess of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Sparklypoo.</p>
<p>And some cursed sixth-year girl had hit her with a Sparkling
Jinx, she hadn't even known there <em>was</em> such a thing as a
Sparkling Jinx, and <em>Finite Incantatem</em> hadn't worked, and
she'd asked older girls who she'd <em>thought</em> were her friends
(she had apparently been wrong about this) and then she'd
threatened the caster with grievous political mayhem wreaked by her
father and nonetheless Daphne Greengrass was still sitting in the
Slytherin common room with her head in her hands, sparkling
brightly and wondering how she'd ended up as the only sane person
in Hogwarts.</p>
<p>It was <em>after dinnertime</em> and they were <em>still at
it</em> and if they didn't stop by tomorrow morning she was going
to transfer to Durmstrang and become the next Dark Lady.</p>
<p>"Hey, everyone!" said the Carrow twins dramatically, waving an
issue of the <em>Daily Prophet.</em> "Did you hear the news? The
Wizengamot just ruled that 'let's see what you got' constitutes a
lawful challenge to be fought until the challenger lies down and
has a nap!"</p>
<p>"How dare you insult the honor of the Sparkly Unicorn Princess!"
shouted Tracey. "Let's see what you got!" Then Tracey lay down flat
on her sofa and started snoring loudly.</p>
<p>Daphne's sparkling head sank further into her glowing hands.
"After my family takes over I'm going to have you all put under
anti-Apparition jinxes and Flooed into the sea," she said to no one
in particular. "You're all okay with that, right?"</p>
<p><em>Thunk-thunk, thunk-thunk-thunk, thunk.</em></p>
<p>Daphne looked up, surprised; that was a Sunshine code-signal
-</p>
<p>"<em>I hight someone knocking!</em> " bellowed Mr. Goyle.
"<em>Knocking of the door!</em> "</p>
<p>"<em>Let's see what you've got, door!</em> " shouted an older
boy near the door, and yanked the door open.</p>
<p>There was a moment of complete surprise.</p>
<p>"I've come to have a word with Miss Greengrass," said the
Sunshine General, sounding like she was trying to sound confident.
"Could someone please -"</p>
<p>From the look on Hermione's face she had just noticed Daphne
sparkling.</p>
<p>And <em>that</em> was when Millicent Bulstrode raced up from the
lower dorms and shouted, "Hey, everyone, guess what, now
<em>Granger</em> went and beat up Derrick and what's left of his
crew, and his father owled him and said that if he didn't -"</p>
<p>Millicent caught sight of Hermione standing in the doorway.</p>
<p>There was a very loud silence.</p>
<p>"Uh," said Daphne. <em>What?</em> said her brain. "Uh, what're
you doing here, General?"</p>
<p>"Well," said Hermione Granger with a strange smile on her face,
"I've decided it's not fair if mysterious old wizards give some
people a chance to be heroes and not others, and also I've read
history books and there aren't nearly enough girl heroes in them.
So I thought I'd just drop by and see if you wanted to be a hero
and why are you glowing like that?"</p>
<p>There was another silence.</p>
<p>"This," said Daphne, "was probably <em>not</em> the best time to
ask me that question -"</p>
<p>"<em>I'll take it!</em> " shouted Tracey Davis, leaping off her
sofa.</p>

<p>Even if you had been the Deputy Headmistress for three decades,
and a Transfiguration Professor before that, it was rare that you
saw Albus Dumbledore caught completely flatfooted.</p>
<p>"...Susan Bones, Lavender Brown, and Daphne Greengrass," Minerva
finished. "I should also note, Albus, that Miss Granger's account
of your seemingly unsupportive attitude - I believe her phrase was
'he said I should be happy to be just a sidekick' - has generated a
good deal of <em>interest</em> among the older girls. Several of
whom came to me to ask if Miss Granger's accusations were true,
since Miss Granger had said that I was there."</p>
<p>The old wizard leaned back in his huge chair, still gazing at
her, his eyes looking rather abstracted beneath the half-moon
glasses.</p>
<p>"It placed me in something of a dilemma, Albus," said Professor
McGonagall. Her face stayed quite neutral, she made sure of that.
"I now know that you did not truly mean to discourage the girl.
Quite the opposite, in fact. But you and Severus have often told me
that to keep a secret I must give no sign that differs from the
reaction of someone truly ignorant. Thus I had no choice but to
confirm that Miss Granger's account was accurate, and feign the
appropriate degree of worry, with a slight overtone of offense.
After all, had I <em>not</em> known you were deliberately
manipulating Miss Granger, I might have been rather put out."</p>
<p>"I... see," the old wizard said slowly. His hands toyed absently
with his silver beard, small quick gestures.</p>
<p>"Thankfully," Professor McGonagall continued, "so far Professors
Sinistra and Vector are the only two faculty members to don Miss
Granger's buttons."</p>
<p>"Buttons?" repeated the old wizard.</p>
<p>Minerva drew forth a small silver disc bearing the initials
S.P.H.E.W., laid it on Albus's desk, and gave it a brief tap with
her finger.</p>
<p>And the voices of Hermione Granger, Padma Patil, Parvati Patil,
Lavender Brown, Susan Bones, Hannah Abbott, Daphne Greengrass, and
Tracey Davis cried out in unison, "<em>We won't settle for second
best, it's time to give a witch a quest!</em> "</p>
<p>"Miss Granger is selling them for two Sickles, and tells me that
she has so far sold fifty of them. I believe that Nymphadora Tonks,
in seventh-year Hufflepuff, is enchanting them for her. To conclude
my report," Professor McGonagall said briskly, "our eight newly
minted heroines have asked permission to conduct a protest outside
the entrance to your office."</p>
<p>"I hope," Albus said, frowning, "you explained to them that
-"</p>
<p>"I explained to them that Wednesday at 7PM would be fine," said
Minerva. She took back the button from the Headmaster's desk,
favored Albus with a honeyed smile, and turned to the door.</p>
<p>"Minerva?" said the old wizard from behind her.
"<em>Minerva!</em> "</p>
<p>The oaken door shut solidly behind her.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>There wasn't a lot of room between the brief stone walls that
demarcated the vestibule to the Headmaster's office, so although a
lot of people had wanted to watch the protest, not many had been
allowed to come. Just Professor Sinistra and Professor Vector, who
were wearing the buttons, and the prefects Penelope Clearwater and
Rose Brown and Jacqueline Preece, who were wearing the buttons.
Behind <em>them,</em> Professor McGonagall and Professor Sprout and
Professor Flitwick, who weren't wearing the buttons, scrutinizing
the whole affair. Harry Potter and the Head Boy of Hogwarts were
there, and the boy prefects Percy Weasley and Oliver Beatson, all
wearing the buttons to show Solidarity. And of course the eight
founding members of S.P.H.E.W., forming a picket line next to the
gargoyles with their signs. Hermione's own sign, attached to a
solid wooden handle which seemed to weigh heavier and heavier in
her hands as the seconds passed, said NOBODY'S SIDEKICK.</p>
<p>And Professor Quirrell, who was leaning with his back against
the far stone wall and watching with unreadable eyes. The Defense
Professor had gotten one of her buttons, though she'd never sold
one to him; and he wasn't wearing it, but idly tossing it with one
hand.</p>
<p>This whole idea had seemed like a much better idea four days
ago, when the fires of her indignation had been burning fresh and
hot, and she'd been facing the prospect of doing it all four days
<em>later</em> instead of <em>right now.</em></p>
<p>But she had to carry on, because that was what heroes did, they
carried on, and also because it had seemed infinitely too awful to
tell everyone she was calling it off. Hermione wondered how much
heroism had gone on for reasons like that. Most books didn't
<em>say</em> "And then they refused to give up, no matter how
sensible it would have been, because that would've been too
embarrassing"; but a great deal of history made a lot more sense
that way.</p>
<p>At 7:15pm, Professor McGonagall had told her, Headmaster
Dumbledore would come down and talk to them for a couple of
minutes. Professor McGonagall had said not to be frightened - the
Headmaster was a good person deep down, and they'd properly gotten
the school's authorization for the protest.</p>
<p>But Hermione was very very aware that even if she was doing it
with signed permission, she was still Defying Authority.</p>
<p>After she'd decided to be a hero, Hermione had done the obvious
thing, and gone to the Hogwarts library and taken out books on how
to be a hero. Then she'd returned those books back to their
shelves, because it'd been patently obvious that none of the
authors had been actual heroes themselves. Instead she'd just read
five times over, until she'd memorized every word, the thirty
inches by Godric Gryffindor that was all his autobiography and his
life's advice. (Or the English translation, anyway; she couldn't
read Latin yet.) Godric Gryffindor's autobiography had been a lot
more <em>compressed</em> than the books Hermione was used to
reading, he used <em>one sentence</em> to say things that should've
taken thirty inches just by themselves, and then there was
<em>another</em> sentence after that...</p>
<p>But it was clear from what she'd read that, while Defying
Authority wasn't the <em>point</em> of being a hero, you couldn't
be a hero if you were too scared to do it. And Hermione Granger
knew by now how others saw her, and she knew what other people
thought she couldn't do.</p>
<p>Hermione hefted her picket sign a little higher and concentrated
on breathing slowly and rhythmically instead of hyperventilating
until she fell over.</p>
<p>"<em>Really?</em> " said Miss Preece in a tone of undisguised
fascination. "They couldn't <em>vote?</em> "</p>
<p>"Indeed," said Professor Sinistra. (The Astronomy Professor's
hair was still dark, and her dark face only slightly lined;
Hermione <em>would</em> have guessed her age at around seventy,
except -) "I quite remember my mother's rejoicing when they
announced the Qualification of Women Act, although she did not
actually qualify." (Which meant that Professor Sinistra had been
around her Muggle family in 1918.) "And that wasn't the worst of
it. Why, just a few centuries earlier -"</p>
<p>Thirty seconds later all the non-Muggleborns, male and female
both, were staring at Professor Sinistra with utterly shocked
expressions. Hannah had dropped her sign.</p>
<p>"And <em>that</em> wasn't the worst of it either, not by half,"
finished Professor Sinistra. "But you see where this sort of thing
could potentially lead."</p>
<p>"Merlin preserve us," said Penelope Clearwater in a strangled
voice. "You mean <em>that's</em> how men would treat us if we
didn't have wands to defend ourselves?"</p>
<p>"<em>Hey!</em> " said one of the boy prefects. "<em>That's</em>
not -"</p>
<p>There was a short, sardonic laugh from the direction of
Professor Quirrell. When Hermione turned her head to look she saw
that the Defense Professor was still idly toying with the button,
not bothering to glance up at the rest of them, as he said, "Such
is human nature, Miss Clearwater. Rest assured that <em>you</em>
would be no kinder, if witches had wands and men lacked them."</p>
<p>"I hardly think so!" snapped Professor Sinistra.</p>
<p>A cold chuckle. "I suspect it happens more often than any dare
suggest, in the proudest pureblood families. Some lonely witch
spies a handsome Muggle; and thinks how very easy it would be, to
slip the man a love potion, and by him be adored alone and utterly.
And since she knows he can offer her no resistance, why, it is only
natural for her to take from him whatever she pleases -"</p>
<p>"<em>Professor Quirrell!</em> " said Professor McGonagall
sharply.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," Professor Quirrell said mildly, his eyes still
looking down on the button in his hand, "are we all still
pretending it doesn't happen? My apologies, then."</p>
<p>Professor Sinistra snapped, "And I suppose that wizards don't
-"</p>
<p>"There are <em>children</em> present, Professors!" Again
Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>"Some do," Professor Quirrell said equably, as though discussing
the weather. "Although personally, I don't."</p>
<p>There was a bit of silence, for a time. Hermione put up her sign
again - it had slipped down to her shoulder while she was
listening. She'd never thought of that, not even a little, and now
she was trying <em>not</em> to think of it, and her stomach was
feeling a bit queasy. She looked in Harry Potter's direction, not
quite knowing why she did; and she saw that Harry's face was
perfectly still. A chill ran down her spine before she looked away,
not quite fast enough to miss the small nod that Harry gave her, as
though they were agreeing on something.</p>
<p>"To be fair," Professor Sinistra said after a while, "since I
received my Hogwarts letter I can't recall encountering any
prejudice on account of being a woman, or colored. No, now it is
all for being a Muggleborn. I believe Miss Granger said that it was
<em>just</em> with heroes that she found a problem, so far?"</p>
<p>It took Hermione a moment to recognize that she'd been asked the
question, and then she said "Yes," in a tone that squeaked a
little. This whole thing had blown up a bit larger than she'd
imagined when she'd started it.</p>
<p>"What exactly did you check, Miss Granger?" said Professor
Vector. She looked older than Professor Sinistra, her hair starting
to gray a little; Hermione hadn't ever come close to Professor
Vector in person until the Arithmancy Professor had asked her for a
button.</p>
<p>"Um," Hermione said, her voice a little high, "I checked the
history books and there's been as many woman Ministers of Magic as
men. Then I looked at Supreme Mugwumps and there were a few more
wizards than witches but not many. But if you look at people like
famous Dark Wizard hunters, or people who've stopped invasions of
Dark creatures, or people who've overthrown Dark Lords -"</p>
<p>"And the Dark Wizards themselves, of course," said Professor
Quirrell. <em>Now</em> the Defense Professor had looked up. "You
may add that to your list, Miss Granger. Among all the suspected
Death Eaters we know of only two sorceresses, Bellatrix Black and
Alecto Carrow. And I daresay that most wizards would be
hard-pressed to name a single Dark Lady besides Baba Yaga."</p>
<p>Hermione just stared at him.</p>
<p>He couldn't <em>possibly</em> be -</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell," said Professor Vector, "what exactly are
you implying?"</p>
<p>The Defense Professor raised the button so that the
golden-lettered S.P.H.E.W. faced them, and said, "Heroes," then
turned the button to show its silver backside and said, "Dark
Wizards. They are similar career paths followed by similar people,
and one can hardly ask why young witches are turning away from one
course without considering its reflection."</p>
<p>"Oh, <em>now</em> I see!" said Tracey Davis, speaking up so
suddenly that Hermione gave a small startle. "You're joining our
protest because you're worried that not enough girls are becoming
Dark Witches!" Then Tracey giggled, which Hermione couldn't have
managed at this point if you paid her a million pounds
sterling.</p>
<p>There was a half-smile on Professor Quirrell's face as he
replied, "Not really, Miss Davis. In truth I do not care about that
sort of thing in the slightest. But it is futile to count the
witches among Ministers of Magic and other such ordinary folk
leading ordinary existences, when Grindelwald and Dumbledore and
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named were all men." The Defense Professor's
fingers idly spun the button, turning it over and over. "Then
again, only a very few folk ever do anything interesting with their
lives. What does it matter to you if <em>they</em> are mostly
witches or mostly wizards, so long as <em>you</em> are not among
them? And I suspect you will not be among them, Miss Davis; for
although you are ambitious, you have no ambition."</p>
<p>"<em>That's not true!</em> " said Tracey indignantly. "And
what's it mean?"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell straightened from where he had been leaning
against the wall. "You were Sorted into Slytherin, Miss Davis, and
I expect that you will grasp at any opportunity for advancement
which falls into your hands. But there is no great ambition that
you are driven to accomplish, and you will not <em>make</em> your
opportunities. At best you will grasp your way upward into Minister
of Magic, or some other high position of unimportance, never
breaking the bounds of your existence."</p>
<p>Then Professor Quirrell's gaze shifted away from Tracey, he was
looking at <em>her,</em> the pale blue eyes staring at her with an
awful intensity <em>-</em> "Tell me, Miss Granger. Do <em>you</em>
have an ambition?"</p>
<p>"Professor -" squeaked the high stern voice of Professor
Flitwick, and then her Head of House's voice cut off, and from the
side of her vision Hermione saw that Harry had laid his hand on
Professor Flitwick's shoulder and was shaking his head, face
looking very adult.</p>
<p>Hermione felt like a deer caught in headlights.</p>
<p>"What drove you to break your bounds, Miss Granger?" said the
Defense Professor, still gazing directly at her. "Why is getting
good marks in class no longer enough? Is it true greatness that you
seek? Does some aspect of the world dissatisfy you, that you must
remake according to your will? Or is this all merely a child's game
to you? I will be quite disappointed if this is only about rivaling
Harry Potter."</p>
<p>"I -" said Hermione, her voice so high-pitched it made a sort of
peeping sound, but then she couldn't think of what else to say.</p>
<p>"You may take a moment to think, if you like," said Professor
Quirrell. "Pretend it is a homework essay, six inches due Thursday.
I hear you are quite eloquent in them."</p>
<p>Everyone was looking at her.</p>
<p>"I -" said Hermione. "I don't agree with one single thing you
just said, anywhere."</p>
<p>"Well spoken," came Professor McGonagall's crisp voice.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's gaze did not waver. "That is not six
inches, Miss Granger. <em>Something</em> drives you to defy the
Headmaster's verdict and gather followers about yourself. Perhaps
it is something you prefer not to speak aloud?"</p>
<p>Hermione knew the correct answer wouldn't impress Professor
Quirrell, but it was the correct answer, so she said it. "I don't
think you need ambition to be a hero," Hermione said. Her voice
wavered but it didn't crack. "I think you just have to do what's
right. And they're not my followers, we're friends."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell leaned back against the wall again. The
half-smile had faded from his face. "Most folk tell themselves they
are doing right, Miss Granger. They do not thereby rise above the
ordinary."</p>
<p>Hermione took a couple of deep breaths, trying to be brave.
"It's not <em>about</em> being not ordinary," she said as stoutly
as she could. "But I think if someone just tries to do what's
right, over and over again, and they're not too lazy to do all the
work it takes, and they think about what they're doing, and they're
brave enough to do it even when they're scared -" Hermione paused
for an instant, her eyes darting to Tracey and Daphne, "- and they
cleverly plan how to do it - and they don't just do what other
people do - then I think someone like that would already get into
enough trouble."</p>
<p>Some of the girls and boys chuckled, as did Professor
McGonagall, who looked wry and proud at the same time.</p>
<p>"You may be right about that," said the Defense Professor, his
eyes half-lidded. He tossed Hermione the button, and she caught it
without thinking. "My donation to your cause, Miss Granger. I
understand that they are worth two Sickles."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor turned and walked away without another
word.</p>
<p>"I thought I was going to faint!" gasped Hannah after his
footsteps had faded, and she heard some of the other girls letting
out their breath or putting down their signs for a moment.</p>
<p>"I do <em>too</em> have an ambition!" said Tracey, who seemed to
be almost on the verge of tears. "I'm - I'm - I'll figure out what
it is by tomorrow, but I have one, I'm sure!"</p>
<p>"If you really can't think of anything," Daphne said, giving
Tracey a comforting pat on the shoulder, "just go with the oldie
but goodie and try to take over the world."</p>
<p>"Hey!" said Susan sharply. "You're supposed to be heroes now!
That means you have to be <em>good!</em> "</p>
<p>"No, it's all right," said Lavender, "I'm pretty sure General
Chaos wants to take over the world and <em>he's</em> sort of a good
guy."</p>
<p>More conversation was going on behind the picket line. "My
goodness," said Penelope Clearwater. "I think that's the most
<em>overtly</em> evil Defense Professor we've ever had."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall coughed warningly, and the Head Boy said,
"You weren't around for Professor Barney," which made several
people twitch.</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell just <em>talks</em> like that," said Harry
Potter, though he sounded less certain than before. "I mean, think
about it, he doesn't <em>do</em> anything like what Professor Snape
does -"</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter," squeaked Professor Flitwick, voice polite and face
stern, "why did you ask me to stay silent?"</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell was testing Hermione to see if he wanted to
be her mysterious old wizard," Harry said. "Which totally would not
have worked out in any way, shape, or form, but she had to answer
for herself."</p>
<p>Hermione blinked.</p>
<p>Then Hermione blinked again, as she realized that it was
Professor Quirrell who was Harry Potter's mysterious old wizard,
and not Dumbledore at all, and that <em>really wasn't a good sign
-</em></p>
<p>A rumbling noise filled the small stone vestibule, and Hermione,
her nerves already on edge, spun rapidly around, almost dropping
her protest sign as her other hand darted toward her wand.</p>
<p>The gargoyles were stepping aside, the Flowing Stone rumbling
like rock as it moved like flesh. The huge ugly figures waited only
briefly, dead gray eyes staring out in silent vigil. Then the great
gargoyles folded their wings back into place and stepped back into
their former positions, the Flowing Stone not changing its outward
appearance at all as it returned from flexibility to
motionlessness, and the brief gap in the stone of Hogwarts was
solid once more.</p>
<p>And before them all, wearing robes of bright purple that
probably only looked hideous if you were Muggleborn, stood the
towering form of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, the
Headmaster of Hogwarts, the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, the
Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards, the
vanquisher of the Dark Lord Grindelwald and protector of Britain,
the rediscoverer of the fabled Twelve Uses of Dragon's Blood, the
most powerful wizard alive; and he was looking at <em>her,</em>
Hermione Jean Granger, General of the recently expanded Sunshine
Regiment, who was getting the best grades in the first year of
Hogwarts classes, and who had declared herself a heroine.</p>
<p>Even her <em>name</em> was shorter than his.</p>
<p>The Headmaster smiled benevolently at her, his wrinkle-lined
eyes twinkling cheerfully beneath their half-circles of glass, and
said, "Hello, Miss Granger."</p>
<p>The odd thing was that it wasn't nearly as scary as talking to
Professor Quirrell. "Hello, Headmaster Dumbledore," Hermione said
with only a slight quaver in her voice.</p>
<p>"Miss Granger," said Dumbledore, now looking more serious, "I
think you and I may have had a bit of a misunderstanding. I did not
mean to imply that you could not, or should not be a hero. I
certainly did not mean to imply that witches in general should not
be heroes. Only that you were... a bit young, to be thinking of
such things."</p>
<p>Hermione, unable to help herself, glanced at Professor
McGonagall and saw that Professor McGonagall was giving her an
encouraging smile - or she was giving the two of them <em>some</em>
kind of smile, anyway - so Hermione looked back at the Headmaster
and said, the small quaver in her voice a little larger now, "Since
you became Headmaster forty years ago, there've been eleven
students to graduate Hogwarts who became heroes, I mean people like
Lupe Cazaril and so on, and <em>ten</em> of those were boys.
Cimorene Linderwall was the only witch."</p>
<p>"Hm," said the Headmaster. There was a thoughtful expression on
his face; he at least <em>seemed</em> to be thinking about it.
"Miss Granger, I have never been one for tallying such numbers.
Often it is too much easier to count than to understand. Many good
people have come out of Hogwarts, witches and wizards both; those
famed as heroes are only one kind of good person, and perhaps not
the highest. You did not include Alice Longbottom or Lily Potter in
your reckoning... But leave that aside. Tell me, Miss Granger, did
you tally how many heroes came out of Hogwarts in the forty years
before me? For in that time I can recall only three now called
heroes; and among those three, no witches at all."</p>
<p>"I'm not trying to say it's <em>just</em> you!" Hermione said.
"Only I think maybe a <em>lot</em> of people, like the Headmasters
before you too, maybe even your whole society and everything, might
be discouraging girls."</p>
<p>The old wizard sighed. His half-glasses eyes looked only at her,
as though they were the only two people present. "Miss Granger, it
might be possible to discourage witches from becoming Charms
Mistresses, or Quidditch players, or even Aurors. But not heroes.
If someone is meant to be a hero then a hero they will be. They
will walk through fire and swim through ice. Dementors will not
stop them, nor the deaths of friends, and not discouragement
either."</p>
<p>"Well," Hermione said, and paused, struggling with the words.
"Well, I mean... what if that's not <em>actually</em> true? I mean,
to <em>me</em> it seems that if you want more witches to be heroes,
you ought to teach them heroing."</p>
<p>"Many boys and girls are heroes in their dreams," Dumbledore
said quietly. He did not look at any of the other girls, only at
her. "Fewer in the waking world. Many have stood their ground and
faced the darkness when it comes for them. Fewer come for the
darkness and force it to face them. It is a hard life, sometimes
lonely, often short. I have told none to refuse that calling, but
neither would I wish to increase their number."</p>
<p>Hermione hesitated; there was something in the lined face that
stopped her, like a hint to all the emotion that wasn't being
displayed, years and years of it...</p>
<p><em>Maybe if there were more heroes, their lives wouldn't be so
lonely, or so short.</em></p>
<p>She couldn't bring herself to say that, though, not to him.</p>
<p>"But the point is moot," said the old wizard. He smiled, a bit
ruefully she thought. "Miss Granger, you cannot teach heroism like
you would teach Charms. You cannot assign twelve inches on how to
carry on when all hope seems lost. You cannot rehearse students on
when to stand up and tell the Headmaster he has done wrong. Heroes
are born, not taught. And for whatever reason, more of them are
born boys than girls." The Headmaster shrugged, as if to say that
<em>he</em> was helpless to do anything about that.</p>
<p>"Um," Hermione said. She couldn't help it, she glanced behind
her.</p>
<p>Professor Sinistra was looking a bit indignant. And it
<em>wasn't</em> true that everyone was staring at her like she'd
just been silly, the way she'd started to imagine while she was
listening to Dumbledore.</p>
<p>Hermione turned back to face Dumbledore again, took a deep
breath, and said, "Well, maybe people who are going to be heroes,
will be heroes no matter what. But I don't see how anyone could
really <em>know</em> that, aside from just saying it afterward. And
when <em>I</em> told you that I wanted to be a hero, you weren't
very encouraging."</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter," the Headmaster said mildly. His eyes didn't leave
hers. "Please tell Miss Granger your impression of our own first
meeting. Would you say that I was encouraging? Speak the
truth."</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter?" said Professor Vector's voice from behind her,
sounding puzzled.</p>
<p>"Um," Harry's voice said from further back, sounding extremely
reluctant. "Um... well, actually in my case the Headmaster set fire
to a chicken."</p>
<p>"He <em>what?</em> " Hermione blurted, only there were several
other people exclaiming things at around the same time so she
wasn't sure anyone heard her.</p>
<p>Dumbledore went on gazing at her, looking perfectly serious.</p>
<p>"I didn't know about Fawkes," Harry's voice said rapidly, "so he
told me that Fawkes was a phoenix, while he was pointing to a
chicken on Fawkes's stand so I'd think <em>that</em> was Fawkes,
and then he set the chicken on fire - and also he gave me this big
rock and told me it had belonged to my father and I ought to carry
it everywhere -"</p>
<p>"But that's <em>crazy!</em> " Susan blurted out.</p>
<p>There was a sudden hush.</p>
<p>The Headmaster slowly turned his head to stare at Susan.</p>
<p>"I -" said Susan. "I mean - I -"</p>
<p>The Headmaster leaned down until he was face-to-face with the
young girl.</p>
<p>"I didn't -" said Susan.</p>
<p>Dumbledore put a finger to his lips and twiddled them, making a
<em>bweeble-bweeble-bweeble</em> sound.</p>
<p>The Headmaster straightened up again and said, "Well, my good
heroines, it has been pleasant speaking to you, but alas, much else
remains to do this day. Still, rest assured that I am inscrutable
at everyone, not just witches."</p>
<p>The gargoyles stepped aside, the Flowing Stone rumbling like
rock as it moved like flesh.</p>
<p>The huge ugly figures waited briefly with dead gray eyes staring
out in silent vigil, as Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore,
smiling as benevolently as when he'd first emerged from his office,
stepped back into the Enchantment of the Endless Stair.</p>
<p>Then the great gargoyles folded their wings back into place and
stepped back into their former positions, only one last brief
"Bwa-ha-ha!" echoing out before the gap closed.</p>
<p>There was a long silence.</p>
<p>"He <em>really</em> set a chicken on fire?" said Hannah.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The eight of them had continued protesting even after that, but
to be honest their heart had gone out of it.</p>
<p>It <em>had</em> been established, after some careful questions
from Professor Flitwick, that Harry Potter hadn't smelled the
chicken burning. Which meant that it had probably been a pebble or
something, Transfigured into a chicken and then enclosed in a
Boundary Charm to make sure that no smoke escaped into the air -
both Professor Flitwick and Professor McGonagall had been very
emphatic about nobody trying that without their supervision.</p>
<p>But still...</p>
<p>But still... what?</p>
<p>Hermione didn't even <em>know</em> but still what.</p>
<p>But <em>still</em>.</p>
<p>After a lot of glances exchanged between girls none of whom had
wanted to be first to say it, Hermione had declared the protest
over, and the adults and boys had drifted off.</p>
<p>"You don't think we were being unfair to Dumbledore, do you?"
said Susan as the heroines walked away to the sound of eight pairs
of feet trodding on the stone paving of Hogwarts's corridors. "I
mean, if he <em>is</em> crazy at everyone and not just at witches
then it's not discrimination, right?"</p>
<p>"I don't want to protest against the Headmaster any more,"
Hannah said weakly. The Hufflepuff girl seemed a bit unsteady on
her feet. "I don't care what Professor McGonagall says about him
not holding it against us, it's just too much for my nerves."</p>
<p>Lavender snorted. "I guess <em>you</em> won't be slaying armies
of Inferi anytime soon -"</p>
<p>"Stop that!" Hermione said sharply. "Look, all of us have got to
<em>learn</em> to be heroines, right? It's okay if someone doesn't
know right away."</p>
<p>"The Headmaster doesn't think it <em>can</em> be learned," Padma
said. The Ravenclaw girl's face was thoughtful, her steps measured
as she strode through the corridor. "The Headmaster doesn't even
think that's a good idea."</p>
<p>Daphne was striding with her back straight and her head held
bolt upright, looking more like a Proper Young Lady in her Hogwarts
robes than Hermione could have done with her best formal dress.
"The Headmaster," Daphne said in a precise voice, her shoes making
hard, sharp tacking sounds on the stone, "thinks the lot of us are
a bunch of silly girls playing games, and that someday Hermione
might make a good sidekick but the rest of us are hopeless."</p>
<p>"Is he <em>right?</em> " said Parvati. The Gryffindor girl's
face was very serious, making her look much more like her twin than
she usually did. "I mean it has to be asked -"</p>
<p>"<em>No!</em> " spat Tracey. The Slytherin girl was stalking
through the hallway looking ready to <em>kill</em> someone, like a
miniature female Snape. Of all the girls, Tracey was the one who
Hermione knew least. Hermione had talked to Lavender once before,
but she'd never really <em>seen</em> Tracey except at wandpoint
during a battle, until the Slytherin had jumped up from her sofa to
volunteer. "We'll show him! We'll show them <em>all!</em> "</p>
<p>"Okay," said Susan, "that was <em>definitely</em> evil -"</p>
<p>"No," said Lavender, "that's a Chaos Legion motto, actually.
Only she didn't do the insane laughter."</p>
<p>"That's right," Tracey said, her voice low and grim. "This time
I'm not laughing." The girl went on stalking through the corridor,
like she had dramatic music accompanying her that only she could
hear.</p>
<p>(Hermione was starting to worry about what <em>exactly</em> the
impressionable youths of the Chaos Legion were learning from Harry
Potter.)</p>
<p>"But - I mean -" Parvati said. She still had a contemplative
look on her face. "I mean, you can see <em>why</em> the Headmaster
would think we were just silly girls, right? What does protesting
outside the Headmaster's office have to do with becoming
heroines?"</p>
<p>"Huh," Lavender said, now looking thoughtful herself. "That's
true. We should do something heroic. I mean heroinic."</p>
<p>"Um -" said Hannah, which very much expressed Hermione's own
feelings on the subject.</p>
<p>"Well," said Parvati, "has everyone already been through
Dumbledore's third-floor forbidden corridor? I mean everyone in
Gryffindor's been through it by now -"</p>
<p>"Hold <em>on!</em> " Hermione said desperately. "I don't want
you doing anything <em>dangerous!</em> "</p>
<p>There was a pause while everyone looked at Hermione, who was
realizing, much too late, why Dumbledore hadn't wanted anyone
<em>else</em> to be a hero.</p>
<p>"I don't think you can become a heroine if you never do anything
dangerous," Lavender observed reasonably.</p>
<p>"Besides," said Padma, a considering look on her face. "Everyone
knows that nothing <em>really</em> bad ever happens in Hogwarts,
right? To students, I mean, not to the Defense Professors. We've
got all these ancient wards and so on."</p>
<p>"Um -" Hannah said again.</p>
<p>"Yeah," said Parvati, "the worst that can happen is that we'll
lose a few dozen House points or something, and there's two of us
from each House so <em>that'll</em> all come out even."</p>
<p>"Why, that's <em>brilliant,</em> Hermione!" said Daphne in a
tone of great amazement. "The way you set it up means we can get
away with <em>anything!</em> And I didn't even notice your cunning
plan until now!"</p>
<p>"<em>UM</em> -" said Hermione, Hannah, and Susan.</p>
<p>"Right!" said Parvati. "So now it's time for us to become real
heroines. We'll come for the darkness -"</p>
<p>"And make <em>it</em> face <em>us</em> -" said Lavender.</p>
<p>"And teach it to be afraid," Tracey Davis said grimly.</p>

<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 67: Self Actualization, Pt
2<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>In the high reaches of Hogwarts where rooms and corridors
changed on a daily basis, where the territory itself was uncertain
and not just the map, where the stability of the castle began to
fray into dreams and chaos without changing its architectural style
or apparent solidity - in the high reaches of Hogwarts, a battle
would soon be fought.</p>
<p>The presence of so many students would stabilize the corridors
for a time, by dint of constant observation. The rooms and
corridors of Hogwarts sometimes <em>moved</em> even while people
looked directly at them, but they wouldn't <em>change</em>. Even
after eight centuries, Hogwarts was still a little shy about
changing in front of people.</p>
<p>But despite that transient permanence (the Defense Professor had
said) the upper reaches of Hogwarts still had a military realism:
you had to learn the ground anew each time, and check every closet
for secret corridors all over again.</p>
<p>Sunday it was, Sunday the first of March. Professor Quirrell had
recovered enough to supervise battles once more, and they were all
catching up on the backlog.</p>
<p>The Dragon General, Draco Malfoy, watched two compasses he held
in either hand. One compass was the color of the Sun, the other had
a multicolored, iridescent sheen to indicate Chaos. The other two
generals, Draco knew, had been given their own compasses; only
Hermione Granger's hand, and Harry Potter's hand, would hold a
compass that was orange-red and flickered in its reflections like
fire, pointing always to the direction of the largest active
contingent of Dragon Army.</p>
<p>Without those compasses they might have searched for days and
never found each other, which was a territorial hazard of fighting
in the upper levels of Hogwarts.</p>
<p>Draco had a bad feeling about what would happen when Dragon Army
found the Chaos Legion. Harry Potter had changed since Bellatrix
Black had escaped; the Heir of Slytherin had begun to seem truly
Lordly now (and how had Professor Quirrell known that would
happen?) Draco would have felt a lot better with Hermione Granger
standing alongside him with her twenty-three Sunshine Soldiers in
tow, but no, the Sunshine General was being stupidly proud and
refusing to accept aid against General Potter. She wanted to take
down Potter herself, she'd told him.</p>
<p>The Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy had maintained their
influence over Britain for centuries by understanding that you
couldn't always be <em>the</em> most powerful. Sometimes another
Lord was just stronger, and you had to settle for <em>merely</em>
being his foremost lieutenant. You could build up <em>quite</em> a
position of wealth and power over a dozen generations of being
second in command. You just had to be careful, each time, not to
let your House be dragged down with the fall of the Lord you
served. That was the Malfoy tradition which centuries of experience
had honed...</p>
<p>And so Father had thoroughly explained to Draco that if he ran
into someone who was obviously stronger than him, Draco was
<em>not</em> to resent this and <em>not</em> to deny it and
<em>not</em> to throw a tantrum that could sabotage his potential
position, but Draco <em>was</em> to make sure that his place in the
next generation's power structure wasn't any lower than second.</p>
<p>Granger, apparently, had never gotten this lecture from her own
parents, and was still in denial about the obvious fact that Harry
Potter was becoming stronger than her.</p>
<p>So Draco had secretly met with Captain Goldstein and Captain
Bones and Captain Macmillan and they'd agreed to all do their best
to make sure that Dragon and Sunshine didn't engage each other
before they engaged the larger threat of Chaos.</p>
<p>It wasn't <em>really</em> violating the agreement against
traitors, you weren't soliciting traitors if you honestly meant to
<em>help</em> the other army.</p>
<p>A high ringing tone belled through the corridors to signal the
start of the battle, and a moment later Draco shouted
"<em>Go!</em> " and the Dragons started running. It would tire his
soldiers, it would cost them something even after they stopped and
caught their breath, but they <em>had</em> to put Chaos directly
between themselves and the Sunshine Regiment.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry and Neville walked at a leisurely pace through the
corridors, Harry watching the yellow-golden compass that pointed
toward the location of the Sunshine Regiment, and Neville keeping a
lookout just in case they ran into someone else.</p>
<p>Their footsteps sounded a bit thumpy, if you listened
closely.</p>
<p>"So," the Chaotic Lieutenant said after a while. "That's why you
had us practice dueling with all that weight strapped on?"</p>
<p>Harry nodded, keeping his eyes on the compass that led to
Sunshine; if the apparent direction started to change quickly then
they were getting close.</p>
<p>"I didn't want to say anything in front of the others, but a
couple of weeks isn't a lot of time to put on extra muscle," said
Neville. "And the balance is different, and I think this weighs
<em>more</em> actually, and doesn't this count as Transfiguring a
Muggle artifact?"</p>
<p>"Nope," Harry said. "I checked that in advance. You can see it
in Hogwarts statues, so some wizards <em>used</em> to wear it, even
if they were just being fashionable for the Dark Ages." And since
nobody would ever try this if they <em>weren't</em> fighting
first-year students using weak spells like the Sleep Hex, it didn't
count as giving away good ideas, either.</p>
<p>They came to a Y-intersection, an annoying one; neither corridor
bent in quite the right way to take them on a direct intercept
course toward where Sunshine would go as they followed the Chaos
Legion following Dragon Army. So Harry chose what seemed like the
better of the two options, and Neville followed.</p>
<p>"We'd better try a quick Silencing Charm on this stuff when we
get close," Neville said. "It's kind of noisy, they might figure it
out."</p>
<p>Harry nodded, and then said "Good idea" in case Neville hadn't
been looking at him.</p>
<p>They trudged on through the stone-floored corridor of the upper
reach of Hogwarts, lit by windows of plain glass or stained glass,
now and then passing statues of witches and dragons and even the
occasional wizard-knight in plate armor or chainmail.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The Sunshine Soldiers were striding through a long, wide
corridor with their wands out and pointed. They couldn't use the
Prismatic Shield while they were maneuvering, but Parvati Patil and
Jenny Rustad were currently maintaining <em>Contegos</em> around
the officer group, who would be the first targets of any
ambush.</p>
<p>Their tactic for the next battle, she and her officers had
decided, would be to mix directly in with the enemy soldiers as
fast as possible - after having practiced among <em>themselves</em>
how to support one another, avoid hitting each other, and get into
positions where enemy soldiers would hesitate to fire. They'd only
gotten in four hours practice, but she thought her troops would
already be better at that kind of mixed-in fighting than soldiers
who hadn't practiced at all. It seemed like the sort of tactic
Chaos would use, but they hadn't actually used it yet.</p>
<p>It was a good strategy, she believed. And yet still, no matter
how much she'd lectured her soldiers, they'd persisted in
whispering fearful rumors about what Harry and Neville were
learning to do. Finally she'd gone off and talked with Captain
Goldstein, who understood things like Troop Morale, and Anthony had
suggested -</p>
<p>"That's weird," Captain Macmillan spoke up suddenly, frowning at
the fiery and iridescent compasses he held in either hand. (Ernie
was, as Harry would have termed it, "good at spatial
visualization", and so had been designated to hold both compasses
and try to figure out what their enemies were doing.) "I think...
Dragon's not moving fast anymore... I think they got on the other
side of Chaos from us first... and it looks like Chaos is moving to
attack them instead of trying to maneuver out from in between?"</p>
<p>Hermione frowned, trying to understand, and she saw similar
frowns on the faces of Anthony and Ron. If Chaos and Dragon
attacked each other straight out, and spent all their forces
fighting each other, that was practically conceding the battle to
Sunshine...</p>
<p>"Potter thinks we're allied so he's attacking Malfoy now, before
Dragon can link up with us," said Blaise Zabini from the common
ranks of soldiers. "Or Potter just thinks he can beat both armies
in a row, if he attacks them separately." The Slytherin boy gave a
condescending sigh. "Are you going to promote me back to officer
now? You lot are hopeless without me, you know."</p>
<p>They all ignored the talking noises coming from Zabini's
mouth.</p>
<p>"We still moving in the right direction?" said Anthony.</p>
<p>"Yeah," said Ernie.</p>
<p>"We getting close to them?" said Ron.</p>
<p>"Not yet -"</p>
<p>That was when the huge black-wooden doors at the end of the
corridor flew open and crashed into the wall, revealing two figures
almost completely enveloped in grey cloaks, grey cloth stretched
over the faces beneath the grey hoods, one of those figures already
raising a wand and pointing it directly at her.</p>
<p>And then the face of the game changed drastically, as Harry's
voice, high and strained with the effort, screamed the word:</p>
<p>"<em>Stupefy!</em> "</p>
<p>The dueling-grade stunner blasted toward her, she was so shocked
that she didn't start to move until almost too late, as the red jet
of light <em>smashed</em> right through the <em>Contego</em> shield
to their front and she just barely dodged, there was a tingle on
her arm as the red light went past her, and she saw out of the
corner of her eye Susan getting hit and blown off her feet into Ron
-</p>
<p>"<em>Somnium!</em> " bellowed Anthony's voice, followed a moment
later by a dozen voices crying "<em>Somnium!</em> "</p>
<p>Hermione frantically pushed herself to her feet, and as she
rose, she saw the two figures in the grey cloaks just standing
there.</p>
<p>You couldn't <em>see</em> Sleep Hexes, the spell was too weak
-</p>
<p>But there was no way they all could've <em>missed</em>.</p>
<p>"<em>Stupefy!</em> " shrieked the voice of Neville Longbottom,
and another red jet shot at her, she fell in an undignified heap as
she desperately twisted out of the way, and when she scrambled up,
panting, she saw that this time the stunbolt had gotten Ron where
he'd been rising from the ground.</p>
<p>"Hello there, Sunshine," said Harry's voice from beneath his
hood.</p>
<p>"We're the Grey Knights of Chaos," said Neville's voice.</p>
<p>"We'll be your opponents for this battle," said Harry's voice,
"while Chaos's <em>other</em> army slaughters the Dragons."</p>
<p>"And by the way," said Neville's voice, "we're invincible."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The two boys in their grey cloaks and robes, grey cloth over
their faces, stood facing Sunshine's entire army, seemingly unfazed
by a dozen Sleep Hexes.</p>
<p>Daphne heard a soft sigh from beside her, and when her head
turned she saw that Hannah's lips were parted, and the Hufflepuff
girl's eyes were huge, and she was staring at -</p>
<p>It would have been hard to describe the jumble of thoughts that
flashed through Daphne's mind as she realized that Hannah was
staring at Neville rather than Harry, which in turn seemed to
trigger some part of her into noticing that in point of fact
Neville <em>had</em> been getting pretty interesting lately as boys
went, in fact right now the Last Scion of Longbottom was seeming
downright <em>cool,</em> and something woke up inside her and her
own lips parted and everything the Lady her Mother had ever
instructed her about demure demeanors and flattery and scented
shampoo blew straight out of her mind so hard it should have
fluffed her hair about her ears, because she'd watched Hermione and
Harry and she knew how she wanted <em>her</em> own courtship to go
-</p>
<p>Her Lady Mother had also recently instructed her on a few spells
it might be embarrassing not to know if you belonged to the Noble
and Most Ancient House of Greengrass.</p>
<p>Daphne's wand swung to point to her left, and she shouted
"<em>Tonare!</em> "</p>
<p>The wand went over her head, and she spoke the incantation
"<em>Ravum Calvaria!</em> "</p>
<p>And finally she grasped her wand in both hands and shrieked,
"<em>Lucis Gladius!</em> "</p>
<p>The huge magical drain almost sent her to her knees, but she
bore it, and when the blazing shape had fully formed and stabilized
the drain was a little less.</p>
<p>Still, she had a feeling she'd better not try to fight with this
for long.</p>
<p>That everyone was staring at her went <em>quite</em> without
saying, and she <em>should</em> have leaped forward to confront
Neville with her hair billowing around her, but it was all she
could do to walk forward steadily to level her Most Ancient Blade
at Neville Longbottom. That everyone moved aside and made way for
her also went without saying.</p>
<p>"<em>I hight Daphne, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of
Greengrass!</em> " she cried. "<em>Greengrass of Sunshine!</em> "
The dueling forms had gone completely out of her mind, she'd seen
enough plays to remember death challenges and blood challenges but
she couldn't remember at all what was appropriate for this, so she
just pointed the incandescent sword toward the object of her crush
and yelled, "<em>Let's see what you got, Nevvy!</em> "</p>
<p>Once again Harry's voice shrieked "<em>Stupefy!</em> ", and
later on, when she was remembering this, she could never quite
believe she'd managed to do it, but she slashed out with her blade
of light like it was a Beater's bat, and <em>hit the stunbolt back
at Harry</em> who just barely managed to twist out of the way.</p>
<p>"<em>Tonare!</em> " shouted Neville, of the Noble and Most
Ancient House of Longbottom. "<em>Ravum Calvaria, Lucis
Gladius!</em> "</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>For a few seconds, no one did anything but stare at Neville and
Daphne as they started whacking at each other. They were both
moving slowly, and Hermione guessed that the spell was taking a lot
of strength out of them. It wasn't very impressive by comparison,
if you were a Muggleborn and you'd watched certain movies.</p>
<p>But you still had to give them extra credit for using
lightsabers at all.</p>
<p>"Point of order," said Harry's voice. "I know the Defense
Professor is watching, but I still have to ask, does anyone know
whether they'll slice each other in half if they actually hit
-"</p>
<p>"No," Hermione said absently. This had been in one of her
history books, though she'd had no idea the magical dueling sword
looked like <em>that</em>. "They cast it so it'll only stun if it
touches."</p>
<p>"You <em>know</em> that spell?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no, it's the Charm of the Most Ancient Blade, it's only
legal for Noble and Most Ancient Houses to use -"</p>
<p>Hermione stopped talking and looked at Harry, or Harry's grey
hood rather.</p>
<p>"Well," said Harry's voice, "I guess I could take down the rest
of the Sunshine Regiment by myself, then." She couldn't see his
face, but his voice sounded like he was smiling.</p>
<p>"You dodged when Daphne hit your own spell back at you,"
Hermione said. "So whatever you did, you're <em>not</em>
invincible. A <em>Stupefy</em> can still get you."</p>
<p>"Interesting theory," said Harry's voice from beneath the hood.
"Got anyone in your army who can test it?"</p>
<p>"I read about the Stunning Hex once," said Hermione. "A few
months ago. I wonder if I can remember the instructions right?" Her
wand came up to point at Harry.</p>
<p>There was a slight pause, as nearby a boy and a girl breathing
in audible gasps slowly whacked at each other with lightsabers.</p>
<p>"Of course," Harry said, leveling his own wand on her,
"<em>I</em> can just use Somnium on you. That'll take a lot less
effort."</p>
<p>New <em>Contego</em> shields sprung into existence in front of
her, cast by Jenny and Parvati, even as Harry spoke.</p>
<p>The tip of Hermione's own wand began making small motions in the
air, a diamond within a circle, a diamond within a circle,
rehearsing the gesture to match exactly what she remembered seeing
in the book. It would be a difficult feat even for her, but she
<em>had</em> to cast the spell right on the first try, she couldn't
afford any failed castings that would sap her energy.</p>
<p>"You know," said Hermione Granger, "I understand that it's not
really your fault, but I'm getting tired of hearing people talk
about the Boy-Who-Lived like you're - like you're some kind of
<em>god</em> or something."</p>
<p>"Same here, I must say," said Harry Potter. "It's sad how people
keep underestimating me."</p>
<p>Her wand kept rehearsing the diamond within the circle, over and
over. Harry would be recharging his own strength, she knew, even as
she practiced as much as she could before her attack. "I'm starting
to think you need taking down a peg, General Chaos."</p>
<p>"You could be right," Harry said equably. His feet began to
shuffle through what she recognized as a duelist's dance.
"Unfortunately there's nothing left that can defeat me now except
another Harry Potter."</p>
<p>"Let me be specific, Mr. Potter. <em>I'm</em> taking you down a
peg."</p>
<p>"You and what other army?"</p>
<p>"You think you're pretty cool, don't you," said Hermione.</p>
<p>"Why, yes," said Harry. "Yes, I do. Some might call that
arrogant, but am I supposed to be the last person in Hogwarts to
notice how awesome I am?"</p>
<p>Hermione raised her left hand into the air, and made a fist.</p>
<p>It was a signal. Eight designated soldiers in her army would be
pointing their wands at her, and quietly casting <em>Wingardium
Leviosa</em>.</p>
<p>They'd practiced <em>this,</em> too, once Hermione had given up
on lecturing her soldiers, and at Anthony's suggestion, tried
giving them a Sunshine General who <em>looked</em> like she could
defeat invincible enemies.</p>
<p>"You pretend you're Superman," said Hermione. She raised her
left fist higher in the air, and the eight soldiers supporting her
Hovered her off the ground. "<em>Well here's Super Hermione!</em> "
Her hand pushed forward, and as she shot rapidly through the air
toward Harry, regretting only that she couldn't see the look on his
face, her wand made a diamond within a circle and she summoned up
all the magic she could, it felt like she imagined touching a live
wire would feel as the too-powerful spell poured through her when
her voice screamed "<em>Stupefy!</em> "</p>
<p>The red bolt burst from her wand, perfectly formed.</p>
<p>Harry dodged it.</p>
<p>And then, because they hadn't practiced doing this part inside
of hallways, she crashed into a wall.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"<em>Somnium!</em> " shrieked Draco, and then after only a few
seconds to recharge, "<em>SOMNIUM, CURSE YOU!</em> "</p>
<p>He <em>knew</em> he was hitting Theodore, the other boy wasn't
even trying to dodge, but the scion of Nott only grinned as evilly
as his father and leveled his wand -</p>
<p>Draco managed to leap aside just as Theodore said
"<em>Somnium!</em> " but Draco was getting winded, he couldn't keep
this up, Theodore wasn't bothering to dodge at all while Draco had
to keep moving, this was <em>crazy.</em></p>
<p>He had enough strength now to fire again, but -</p>
<p><em>Stupidity is doing the same thing and expecting a different
result,</em> Harry had said, this was <em>Harry's</em> work
somehow, it couldn't be a Muggle artifact anymore but Draco
couldn't figure out what it <em>could</em> be, and he should be
thinking of hypotheses and ways to test them but he was too busy
frantically dodging as Theodore laughed and shot another Sleep Hex
at him, Draco felt a little numbness in his side that time as he
twisted, that had been a very very near miss and finally Draco
couldn't take it anymore, he didn't bother working out what theory
he was testing or why as he just -</p>
<p>"<em>Luminos!</em> " shouted Draco, and Theodore was haloed in
red light, "<em>Dulak!</em> " and it went out again (so Theodore
<em>was</em> still being affected by magic),
"<em>Expelliarmus!</em> " and Theodore's wand went flying (that had
been a good spell to cast anyway now that Draco realized it) but
Theodore was rushing toward Draco with his arms outstretched to
grapple so Draco yelled "<em>Flipendo!</em> " and the other boy's
feet were abruptly yanked up -</p>
<p>- and Theodore's back hit the ground with a surprisingly loud
and <em>metallic</em>-sounding crash.</p>
<p>Draco's vision was swimming now from casting four spells in such
fast succession, and Theodore was already scrambling to his feet,
so there wasn't even time to think in words, but Draco still
managed to say "<em>Somnium!</em> " and <em>this</em> time he aimed
for Theodore's face instead of the chest.</p>
<p>Theodore dodged (he <em>dodged!</em>) and the boy shouted
"<em>Code seven on Malfoy!</em> "</p>
<p>"<em>Prismatis!</em> " cried Padma's voice and there was
suddenly a shimmering rainbow wall in front of Draco, just as four
Chaotic voices cried "<em>Somnium!</em> "</p>
<p>And there was a pause, as everyone looked at the huge Prismatic
Sphere protecting the remnants of Dragon Army.</p>
<p>Casting that fifth spell had sent Draco to his hands and knees,
but he looked up and managed to say, as clearly as he could, "If
the Sleep Hex - doesn't work - aim for the face - I think the
Lieutenants are wearing metal shirts."</p>
<p>"You've already lost too many soldiers," Finnigan said loudly
from across the barrier, "we'll beat you anyway," and then the
Gryffindor boy laughed evilly. He did the evil laughter almost as
well as Harry Potter by now, and the other Chaotic Legionnaires
started laughing with him soon afterward.</p>
<p>Draco could see from the corner of his eye where Gregory and
Vincent lay unconscious. Padma was still sustaining the Prismatic
Sphere, the largest one he'd ever seen her cast; but she was
breathing hard, still visibly sweaty from when they'd all jogged to
get into position, the Ravenclaw girl was a strong witch but not an
<em>athletic</em> one.</p>
<p>He really hoped General Granger got here soon and hit Chaos from
behind. General Potter and Neville of Chaos were missing, and Draco
could guess where they'd gone, but two soldiers couldn't delay the
whole Sunshine Regiment for too long all by themselves, could
they?</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>She knew it wasn't fair, that the other girl had given all she
could, but Hermione still wished that Daphne had lasted longer.</p>
<p>"<em>Lagann!</em> " said Neville's voice from behind her as she
flew, and there was the sound of a Prismatic Wall shattering,
Hannah's voice desperately cried "<em>Somnium!</em> " and then a
few moments later Neville's voice calmly said "Somnium" and there
was the thud of another of her soldiers falling over.</p>
<p>And the force keeping her in the air diminished again, Hermione
could feel the grab of the Hover Charms straining at her, but now
it just wasn't enough.</p>
<p>Her flight stopped and she began falling in slow motion toward
the ground, and she should've signaled her soldiers to just
<em>drop</em> her, but she was too angry and confused and not
thinking fast enough and still trying to muster the strength for
one last Stunning Hex, and so there was nowhere to go when Harry
pointed his wand at her and said "<em>Somnium</em>" and that was
the last word that Hermione Granger heard of her battle.</p>
</div>
<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 71: Self Actualization, Pt
6<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>"Well," Daphne whispered, keeping her voice as low as she could,
"at least now I don't feel like the only sane person in Hogwarts
any more."</p>
<p>"Because now you've got the rest of us as friends?" whispered
Lavender Brown, who was tiptoeing along at her left side.</p>
<p>"I don't think that's what she means," General Granger murmured
from Lavender's own left.</p>
<p>They crept slowly and carefully through the corridors of
Hogwarts, all eight of them keeping both ears peeled for the
slightest sound of Trouble, just like it was a battle and they were
looking for enemy soldiers to ambush; only in this case they were
looking for bullies to Vanquish and victims to Rescue in the span
between the end of breakfast-time and when Lavender and Parvati had
to get to their Herbology class.</p>
<p>Lavender had argued that if one first-year girl could take down
three older bullies, then eight first-year girls ought to be able
to outfight twenty-four older bullies because of
Multiplication.</p>
<p>Judging by her frantic spluttering and waving of hands, General
Granger hadn't found this convincing.</p>
<p>Padma had stayed silent for a bit during the ensuing argument,
and then observed thoughtfully that even in Hogwarts, beating up
first-year girls probably wouldn't be good for your reputation as a
bully.</p>
<p>Parvati had straightened up at this, exclaiming that this meant
they were the <em>only ones</em> who could do something about
Hogwarts's bully problem, which made it <em>really truly</em>
heroinic. Plus the <em>whole reason</em> their parents had moved to
Britain was so that the two of them could attend the world's only
magical school with a 0% fatality rate, and what was the point if
they didn't take advantage and try a few things?</p>
<p>To which General Granger had responded that Parvati didn't
understand the point of a perfect safety record <em>at all</em>
-</p>
<p>Lavender had said that if they were <em>really</em> all friends
together and not Hermione's followers like Professor Quirrell
thought, then they should vote on things like this.</p>
<p>Daphne had expected that hers would be the deciding vote after
Hermione and Susan and Hannah voted no. And so Daphne had
considered it carefully after her first flush of enthusiasm wore
off. She <em>was</em> a Slytherin, after all, and that meant it was
<em>her</em> responsibility to keep a watchful eye on their own
interests while they were all running around trying to help people
- her job to figure out how risky it really was, and whether it
would be worth it for <em>them</em>, just like Mother would have
done in her place. Always looking out for yourself and your friends
like that, was what real Slytherining was all about...</p>
<p>Hannah Abbott, the nervous little Hufflepuff girl, had in a
small trembling voice said "Yes."</p>
<p>And now Daphne and Susan and Hermione <em>had</em> to stay with
the other five, they couldn't <em>possibly</em> let the others go
off on their own. Because no Gryffindor would ever live down
hurting the last surviving child of the Bones family, and no
Slytherin would dare assault a daughter of the Noble and Most
Ancient House of Greengrass. (Daphne <em>hoped</em> so, anyway.)
And General Granger who'd started the whole thing... you didn't
even have to ask.</p>
<p>The corridors of Hogwarts passed them by one after another,
their tense hands never straying far from their wands, as stone and
wood and Everburning Torches came into vision and then moved past.
At one point they heard footsteps and drew in their breath, hands
almost dropping to their wands, but it was just a lone older
Ravenclaw who looked at them curiously before sniffing and dropping
his head back to his book as he walked on.</p>
<p>The heroines crept past solemn oaken panels carved with gilded
frescos, and came to a dead end leading into a boys' bathroom, and
turned around, and wandered <em>back</em> through the solemn oaken
panels carved with gilded frescos, and then turned through dusty
old brick corridors grouted with worn cement, which sort of led
them in a circle actually, so they consulted a portrait and then
went down a <em>different</em> dusty old brick corridor instead,
that took them to a brief rise of marble stairs that should've put
them on the third-and-a-halfth floor if it'd been anywhere but
Hogwarts, and then it was back to tiled stone pavement again, and
skylights that let shafts of sunlight pour down even though they
were nowhere near the roof, and after they'd followed that
passageway around a few corners it took them to another boys'
bathroom, clearly marked with a plaque showing the silhouette of a
robed figure whizzing into a toilet.</p>
<p>The eight of them stood before the closed door and stared with a
certain amount of weariness.</p>
<p>"I'm bored," said Lavender.</p>
<p>Padma made a show of taking a pocketwatch out of her robes and
looking at it. "Sixteen minutes and thirty seconds," she said. "A
new record for the longest attention span in Gryffindor."</p>
<p>"<em>I</em> don't think this is going to work either," said
Susan. "And I'm a <em>Hufflepuff</em>."</p>
<p>"Y'know," Lavender said thoughtfully, "I wonder if maybe what
<em>really</em> makes someone a hero, is that when they try
something like this, something interesting <em>actually
happens</em>."</p>
<p>"I bet you're right," said Tracey. "I bet if we had <em>Harry
Potter</em> with us, we'd run into three bullies and a hidden room
full of treasure in the first five minutes. I bet that all General
Chaos has to do is go to the bathroom and he, like, finds
Slytherin's Chamber of Secrets or something -"</p>
<p>Daphne couldn't quite let that one go past. "You think Lord
Slytherin would've put the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets in a
<em>bathroom -</em>"</p>
<p>"What I'm <em>saying,</em>" said Susan, as Tracey was opening
her mouth to reply, "is that we've got no way of actually
<em>finding</em> any bullies. I mean, all <em>they've</em> got to
do is find a Hufflepuff somewhere, but we've got to run across them
at exactly the right <em>time</em>, d'you see? Which is a <em>very
good problem</em> because if we <em>did</em> find them we'd all get
squished like bugs. Can't we just do the forbidden third-floor
corridor like we're <em>supposed</em> to?"</p>
<p>Lavender snorted scornfully. "You don't become a <em>real</em>
heroine just by doing the forbidden things the Headmaster
<em>tells</em> you not to do!"</p>
<p>(Daphne's mind tried to wrap around this statement as she
silently thanked the Sorting Hat for not putting her anywhere near
Gryffindor.)</p>
<p>"Come to think..." Parvati said slowly, "I mean, what're the
odds that Harry Potter would run across those five bullies on his
<em>first morning</em> of school? He must've had <em>some</em> way
of finding them."</p>
<p>Daphne happened to be standing where looking at Parvati let her
see Hermione, so she noticed the Ravenclaw girl's expression change
- and then she realized that the Sunshine General had <em>also</em>
found some bullies just recently -</p>
<p>"Oh!" said Padma in a tone of sudden realization. "Of course! He
got told by the ghost of Salazar Slytherin!"</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " said Daphne at the same time as several other
people.</p>
<p>"That's who the ghost was that scared me, I'm pretty sure,"
Padma explained. "I mean I only figured it out afterward, but...
yeah. Salazar Slytherin's ghost doesn't like it when Slytherins
bully people, he thinks it shames his name, and the ghost is still
keyed into the Hogwarts wards so he knows everything that happens,
I bet."</p>
<p>Daphne's mouth was hanging open; and she saw that Hannah had put
a hand to her forehead and was leaning against the stone walls,
while Tracey's eyes were blazing like little brown stars.</p>
<p><em>Salazar Slytherin's ghost?</em></p>
<p>Had leagued himself with <em>Harry Potter?</em></p>
<p>And had sent <em>Hermione Granger</em> to stop Derrick's
crew?</p>
<p>She would have paid a hundred Galleons to be there when Draco
Malfoy got told about this.</p>
<p>Although considering how fast rumors spread through Hogwarts,
now that Padma had spilled the beans, Millicent had probably told
him thirty minutes ago...</p>
<p>In fact... now that Daphne <em>thought</em> about it...</p>
<p>"So," said Parvati. "We've got to ask the Boy-Who-Lived where to
find Salazar Slytherin's ghost? Wow, I guess if I'm saying stuff
like that out loud, I might actually be turning into a heroine
-"</p>
<p>"Yes!" said Lavender. "We've got to ask the Boy-Who-Lived where
to find Salazar Slytherin's ghost!"</p>
<p>"We've got to ask... the Boy-Who-Lived... where to find Salazar
Slytherin's ghost..." repeated Hannah in a nervous voice, like she
was forcing herself to say it.</p>
<p>"And if <em>that</em> doesn't work," shouted Tracey, "we'll stun
Harry Potter, tie him up and bring him <em>with</em> us!"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>It said something, Hermione Granger thought, and it was
something rather sad - as the eight of them strolled back through
the maze of twisty little passages that was Hogwarts, their time
before the next class having run out without finding any bullies -
that she genuinely didn't know whether Harry Potter had been led
around by the ghost of Salazar Slytherin or a phoenix or
<em>what.</em> And whatever Harry had done, she hoped it
<em>didn't</em> work for them. And most of all she hoped that the
others didn't vote for Tracey's idea of stunning Harry Potter and
carting his unconscious body around with them to attract
Adventures. That couldn't possibly work in real life, or, if it
did, she was giving up.</p>
<p>Hermione looked from witch to witch, Tracey chatting with
Lavender, and the others making occasional remarks; and her gaze
caught on a girl who was subdued and quiet, the one person whose
thoughts right now she couldn't guess at all.</p>
<p>"Hannah?" she said to the girl walking alongside her. Hermione
tried to make her voice as gentle as she could. "You don't have to
answer, but is it okay if I ask why you voted yes on fighting
bullies?"</p>
<p>Hermione had thought she'd made her voice soft, but everyone
stopped walking, and Lavender and Tracey halted their conversation
and looked at them.</p>
<p>Hannah's cheeks were already reddening, and just as Hannah
opened her mouth -</p>
<p>"It's 'cause she's got more courage than <em>you</em> think,
obviously," said Lavender.</p>
<p>Hannah paused with her mouth open.</p>
<p>She closed her mouth.</p>
<p>She swallowed, hard and visibly, while her cheeks reddened even
further.</p>
<p>Then Hannah took a deep breath, and said, in a small voice,
"There's a boy I like."</p>
<p>The Hufflepuff girl flinched as she said it, and her head darted
around nervously to look at everyone looking at her, while the
pause and silence stretched.</p>
<p>"Um, okay?" Susan said eventually.</p>
<p>"I've got <em>five</em> boys I like," said Lavender.</p>
<p>"Padma and I knew we'd both like the same boys," said Parvati,
"so we made a list and flipped a Knut to see who got to pick
first."</p>
<p>"I know who <em>I'm</em> destined to marry," said Tracey. "I
don't care what the world says, he's meant to be mine!"</p>
<p>This made all the other girls look expectantly at Hermione,
whose brain had gone ahead and flushed Tracey's last statement
entirely so it could focus on just on the first thing Hannah had
said.</p>
<p>"Um," said Hermione. She carefully continued keeping her voice
gentle. "Hannah, the reason why you joined the Society for
Promotion of Heroic Equality for Witches was that there's a boy who
might like you more if you become a hero?"</p>
<p>The Hufflepuff girl nodded again, her cheeks reddening even
further while she stared down at her own reflection in her
black-polished shoes.</p>
<p>"She likes Neville Longbottom, actually," Daphne said. The
Slytherin gave a woeful sigh. "And unfortunately for her, he's
going to marry someone else. It's very tragic."</p>
<p>This produced a high-pitched <em>eeping</em> sound from Hannah
as she went on staring at her feet.</p>
<p>"Wait what?" said Lavender. "Neville's going to marry someone
else? How do you know about this? <em>Who?</em> "</p>
<p>Daphne just shook her head sadly with a downcast expression.</p>
<p>"<em>Excuse me</em>," said Hermione, and then when the others
looked at her again, "Ah..." while she tried to organize her
thoughts. "I mean, um... Hannah... trying to become a hero so that
a boy will like you isn't very <em>feminist</em>."</p>
<p>"It's pronounced <em>feminine</em> actually," said Padma.</p>
<p>"And why're you calling Hannah unfeminine?" said Susan. "There's
nothing unfeminine about wanting to impress a boy."</p>
<p>"Besides," said Parvati, sounding puzzled, "isn't the whole
point that we're trying to be heroes even though that isn't
feminine?"</p>
<p>The ensuing discussion would not be remembered by Hermione
Granger as one of her most successful forays into the realms of
political education. She tried to explain, and then after the
resulting argument tried to explain again, while the other seven
girls looked at her more and more skeptically. Afterward Daphne
declared in the imperious tones of the future Lady Greengrass that
if this feminism business meant girls weren't allowed to pursue
boys in whichever way they pleased, then feminism could stay in the
Muggle lands where it belonged. Lavender suggested that maybe
witchism could say that witches got to do anything they wanted,
which sounded like more fun than feminism. And finally Padma closed
off further discussion by observing wearily that she didn't see
much point to going on arguing, since S.P.H.E.W. wasn't
<em>about</em> anything to do with feminism in the first place, it
was just about more girls becoming heroes.</p>
<p>Hermione had given up at that point.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>As their Charms session that day ended and the first-year
Ravenclaws began shuffling out of the class, Hermione was already
wincing to herself. They'd made it to class just barely before the
opening gong, they'd had to run right over to their desks and sit
down, so there hadn't been time for the awful thing to happen
<em>yet;</em> but that just meant that Hermione got to look forward
to the coming disaster for the <em>whole class.</em></p>
<p>Sure enough, after Professor Flitwick squeaked his dismissal and
everyone rose from their chairs, Harry began walking toward her;
and for her own part Hermione shoved her book into her mokeskin
pouch and very quickly walked over to the door and threw it open
and headed into the corridors, and of course Harry followed her
with a surprised look because they had a library session scheduled
-</p>
<p>"Hermione?" Harry said as he closed the door behind him. "What's
wrong?"</p>
<p>The door flew open behind Harry not a moment after he closed it,
almost hitting Harry as he stepped out of the way, and Padma Patil
stepped out of the classroom with a dreadful look of determination
upon her face.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, Mr. Potter," came the awful words, the young girl's
high voice resounding through the corridor like the gloomy bells of
doom, "can I ask you for help with something?"</p>
<p>Harry's eyebrows drew up, and he said, "You can <em>ask,</em> of
course."</p>
<p>"Can you tell us how to talk to Salazar Slytherin's ghost? We
want him to tell us where to find bullies, like he tells you."</p>
<p>There was a little bit of silence in the corridor outside the
classroom.</p>
<p>The door opened again, and Su peered out with an inquiring look
-</p>
<p>"Well, we've got to get to the library," Harry said quite
casually, his face looking relaxed, "would you mind following us?"
and began to walk off in the direction that led to the library on
odd-numbered days of the month, and Su made like she was going to
follow but Harry's face turned toward her for a moment.</p>
<p>It wasn't until Harry had rounded a corner that he drew his
wand, said in a low precise voice "<em>Quietus</em>" and then
turned to Padma and said, "An interesting guess, Miss Patil."</p>
<p>Padma looked rather smug, then; and said, "I <em>should've</em>
figured it out earlier, really. There was that <em>hiss</em> in the
ghost's voice, I should've thought Parselmouth right away, even
before he started talking about Godric Gryffindor."</p>
<p>Harry's face didn't change. "May I ask, Miss Patil, whether
you've shared this thought with -"</p>
<p>"She said it in front of everyone in S.P.H.E.W.," Hermione
said.</p>
<p>Harry's eyes had that look they had when he was very rapidly
calculating something, and then he said, "Hermione, what's the
chance that -"</p>
<p>"She said it in front of Lavender <em>and</em> Tracey."</p>
<p>"Um," said Padma. "Should I not've done that?"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"Wait here," growled Mr. Goyle, and went around the corner; and
there was the sound of him knocking on Draco Malfoy's private
room.</p>
<p>There was a bit of a queasy feeling in Tracey's stomach, and she
reminded herself again that since Padma had spilled the beans
<em>someone</em> was bound to tell Draco Malfoy, and it might as
well be <em>her</em>, and it wasn't as if she <em>owed</em> Harry
Potter anything, and a Slytherin had to do what was necessary to
achieve her Ambitions.</p>
<p>She'd been collecting Ambitions ever since Professor Quirrell
told her off, and so far she'd decided that she wanted to own her
own Nimbus 2000 broomstick, become super famous, marry Harry
Potter, eat Chocolate Frogs for breakfast every day, and defeat at
least <em>three</em> Dark Lords just to show Professor Quirrell who
was ordinary.</p>
<p>"Mr. Malfoy will see you," said the low, menacing voice of Mr.
Goyle as he returned. "And you'd better hope he doesn't think
you're wasting his time." The boy loomed at her briefly, and then
stepped aside.</p>
<p>Tracey added having her own servants to her list of Ambitions,
and entered.</p>
<p>The Malfoy private bedroom looked just like Daphne's. She'd been
privately hoping for diamond chandeliers or golden frescos on the
walls - she'd never have said it in front of Daphne, but the House
of Malfoy <em>was</em> a step up from Greengrass. But it was just a
small bedroom like Daphne's, and the only difference was that
Malfoy's stuff was decorated in silver snakes instead of emerald
plants.</p>
<p>As she stepped through the doorway, Draco Malfoy - who was
perfectly groomed even inside his own bedroom - rose up from his
desk chair to greet her with a small friendly bow, wearing a
charming smile just like she was someone who <em>mattered,</em>
which made Tracey so flustered that she forgot everything she'd
rehearsed inside her head and just blurted out, "I've got something
to tell you!"</p>
<p>"Yes, Gregory said so," Draco Malfoy said smoothly. "Please,
Miss Davis, sit down." He gestured to <em>his own desk chair</em>,
even as he sat down on his bed.</p>
<p>She felt somewhat lightheaded as she carefully sat herself down
in Malfoy's own chair, her fingers unthinkingly fiddling with how
her dress robes fell across her knees, trying to make them look as
elegant and uncreased as Draco Malfoy's -</p>
<p>"So, Miss Davis," said Draco Malfoy. "What did you want to tell
me?"</p>
<p>Tracey hesitated, and then when Malfoy's face started to look a
bit impatient, just stammered it all out, everything Padma had said
about Salazar Slytherin's ghost sending Harry Potter to stop
bullies and also what Daphne had told her about Hermione Granger
being in on it -</p>
<p>Draco Malfoy's expression didn't change at all as she spoke, not
even in the slightest, and it dawned on Tracey with a sickening
lurch in her stomach.</p>
<p>"You don't <em>believe</em> me!" she said.</p>
<p>There was a slight pause.</p>
<p>"Well," said Draco Malfoy, with a smile that wasn't quite as
charming as his last one, "I <em>do</em> believe that's what Padma
said and what Daphne said, so thank you anyway, Miss Davis." The
boy rose from where he'd been sitting on his bed, and Tracey, not
even thinking, rose from the chair.</p>
<p>As he was escorting her to the door, just as he was about to
turn the knob, it occurred to Tracey that - "You didn't ask what I
wanted for the information," she said.</p>
<p>Draco Malfoy gave her some kind of look, she didn't quite know
what it was supposed to mean, and he didn't say anything.</p>
<p>"Well, anyway," Tracey said, making an on-the-spot change to her
previous Plans, "I <em>don't</em> want anything for the
information, I was just being friendly."</p>
<p>A brief look of surprise crossed Draco Malfoy's face for just an
instant before his expression flattened again and he said, "It's
not that easy to become friends with a Malfoy, Miss Davis."</p>
<p>Tracey smiled, and meant it. "Well, I'll just go on being
friendly, then," she said, and left the room with a skip in her
step, feeling like a real Slytherin for maybe the first time in her
life, and having just decided that Draco Malfoy would be one of her
husbands too.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>After the girl was gone, Gregory came in, shut the door again
and said, "Are you alright, Mr. Malfoy?"</p>
<p>Draco said nothing to his servant and friend. His eyes gazed off
into nowhere, like he was trying to stare through the wall of his
bedroom, through the Hogwarts lake that surrounded the Slytherin
dungeons, through Earth's crust and atmosphere and the interstellar
dust of the Milky Way, into the utterly empty and lightless void
between galaxies which no wizard and no scientist had ever
seen.</p>
<p>"Mr. Malfoy?" Gregory said, starting to sound a little
worried.</p>
<p>"I can't believe I believed every word of that," said Draco.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Daphne finished her final inch of Transfiguration and looked up
across the Slytherin common room, at where Millicent Bulstrode was
still working on her own homework. It was time to come to a
Decision.</p>
<p>If S.P.H.E.W. did go around trying to stun bullies, the bullies
wouldn't like it, that was certain. And they'd try to do something
unpleasant about it, which was also certain. On the other hand, if
the bullies got really nasty then Hermione could ask Harry Potter
for help, or they could pool their combined Quirrell points and ask
the Defense Professor for a favor... No, the thing that Daphne was
<em>really</em> worried about was if this business got them in bad
with Professor Snape. You didn't want to <em>ever</em> end up on
the wrong side of Professor Snape.</p>
<p>But since the day she'd challenged Neville to a Most Ancient
Duel, she'd noticed people looking at her differently. Even the
Slytherins who'd made fun of her were looking at her differently.
It was dawning on Daphne that being the daughter of the Noble and
Most Ancient House of Greengrass brought in a <em>lot</em> more
respect if you were a beautiful <em>heroine</em> born to a Most
Ancient House, and not just a pretty noble girl. It was the
difference between having your role played by the lead actress and
having your role played by a two-Galleon extra with a screechy
laugh.</p>
<p>Fighting bullies might not be the <em>best</em> way to become a
heroine. But Father had once told her that the trouble with passing
up opportunities was that it was habit-forming. If you told
yourself you were waiting for a better opportunity next time, why,
next time you'd probably tell yourself the same thing. Father had
said that most people spent their whole <em>lives</em> waiting for
an opportunity that was good enough, and then they died. Father had
said that while seizing opportunities <em>would</em> mean that all
sorts of things went wrong, it wasn't nearly as bad as being a
hopeless lump. Father had said that <em>after</em> she got into the
habit of seizing opportunities, <em>then</em> it was time to start
being picky about them.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Mother had warned her not to take all of
Father's advice, and said that Daphne wasn't allowed to ask about
Father's sixth year in Hogwarts until she was at least thirty years
old.</p>
<p>But in the end Father <em>had</em> gotten Mother to marry him
and successfully plotted his way into a Most Ancient House, so
there <em>was</em> that.</p>
<p>Millicent Bulstrode finished her homework and began putting her
things away.</p>
<p>Daphne stood up from her desk, and walked over.</p>
<p>Millicent swung out her legs from the table and stood up,
slinging her bookbag over one shoulder, then looked over at where
Daphne was approaching, the girl's expression puzzled.</p>
<p>"Hey, Millicent," Daphne said as she drew near, making her voice
low and excited, "guess what I figured out today?"</p>
<p>"The thing about Salazar Slytherin's ghost helping Granger?"
said Millicent. "I already heard about that -"</p>
<p>"No," Daphne said in a hushed whisper, "this is even
<em>better.</em>"</p>
<p>"Really?" Millicent said, in an equally low excited voice. "What
is it?"</p>
<p>Daphne looked around conspiratorially. "Come to my room and I'll
tell you."</p>
<p>They went off toward the stairs that led downward, the private
rooms were even lower in the lake than the seventh-year
dorms...</p>
<p>Soon enough Daphne was sitting in her comfy desk-chair and
Millicent had bounced over to the edge of her bed.</p>
<p>"<em>Quietus,</em>" said Daphne, when they were both seated; and
then instead of putting her wand away inside her robes, Daphne just
let her hand fall naturally down to her side, still holding the
wand, just in case.</p>
<p>"All <em>right!</em> " said Millicent. "What <em>is</em>
it?"</p>
<p>"You know what I figured out?" said Daphne. "I figured out that
you get the gossip <em>so</em> fast, you know about things
<em>before they actually happen</em>."</p>
<p>Daphne had half-expected Millicent to turn white and fall over,
and she didn't really, but the girl did flinch pretty hard before
she started stammering denials.</p>
<p>"Don't worry," said Daphne with her sweetest smile, "I won't
tell anyone else you're a seer. I mean, we're friends, right?"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Rianne Felthorne, seventh-year of Slytherin, was working
diligently on yet another two-foot essay (she was taking everything
except Divination and Muggle Studies and her N.E.W.T. year seemed
to consist <em>entirely</em> of homework) when her Head of House
strode up to the table she was working at and barked "You will come
with me, Miss Felthorne!" and walked away even as she frantically
began putting away her parchment and book and quill.</p>
<p>When she caught up with Professor Snape, he was waiting just
outside the room and gazing at her with half-lidded eyes that
seemed far too intense; and before she could ask what this was
about he spun without a word and stalked off through the hallways,
so that she had to scramble to keep up.</p>
<p>Their walk took them down a flight of stairs, and then another,
below what she'd thought was the lowest level of the Slytherin
dungeons. And the corridors began to look older in their
appearance, the architecture reverting back in time by centuries
into roughened stone held together by crude-looking mortar. She
began to wonder if Professor Snape was taking her to the
<em>real</em> dungeons that she'd heard rumors of, the true
dungeons of Hogwarts that had been sealed off to all but faculty;
and if maybe Professor Snape did terrible things down there to
innocent helpless young girls but that was probably just wishful
thinking on her part.</p>
<p>They went down another flight of stairs, and came out into a
room that was no room at all, but an empty rock cavern with a
single door, pierced by many dark openings and lit by a single
torch of ancient style that fired as they entered.</p>
<p>Professor Snape took out his wand, then, and began to cast Charm
after Charm, she lost track of how many; and when the Potions
Master was done he turned back toward her, locked his intense eyes
on hers, and said in a level voice unlike his usual drawl, "You
will say nothing to anyone of this matter, Miss Felthorne, nothing
now or ever. If that is acceptable to you, nod. If not, we will
turn and go."</p>
<p>She nodded, frightened and with a strange hope dawning in her
heart (well, not exactly her heart).</p>
<p>"The task I have for you is very simple, Miss Felthorne," said
Professor Snape's toneless voice, "and your extremely generous pay
of fifty Galleons is merely to compensate you for being
Memory-Charmed afterward."</p>
<p>She drew an involuntary breath. Her family might be rich but
they had other daughters and kept her on a tight leash and it was
certainly a lot of money for <em>her</em>.</p>
<p>Then her ears caught up with the words <em>Memory-Charmed</em>
and for a moment she felt outraged, there was no point if she
couldn't keep the memories, what sort of girl did Professor Snape
think she <em>was?</em></p>
<p>"You surely know," said Severus Snape, "of Miss Hermione
Granger, the Sunshine General?"</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " said Rianne Felthorne in sudden horror and
disgust. "She's in her <em>first year!</em> <em>Ew!</em> "</p>

<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 72: SA, Plausible Deniability, Pt
7<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>The winter Sun had well set by the time dinner ended, and so it
was amid the peaceful light of stars twinkling down from the
enchanted ceiling of the Great Hall that Hermione left for the
Ravenclaw Tower alongside her study partner Harry Potter, who
lately seemed to have a <em>ridiculous</em> amount of time for
studying. She hadn't the faintest idea of when Harry was doing his
actual homework, except that it was getting done, maybe by house
elves while he slept.</p>
<p>Nearly every single pair of eyes in the whole Hall lay on them
as they passed through the mighty doors of the dining-room, which
were more like siege gates of a castle than anything students ought
to go through on the way back from supper.</p>
<p>They went out without speaking, and walked until the distant
babble of student conversation had faded into silence; and then the
two of them went on a little further through the stone corridors
before Hermione finally spoke.</p>
<p>"Why'd you do that, Harry?"</p>
<p>"Do what?" said the Boy-Who-Lived in an abstracted tone, as if
his mind were quite elsewhere, thinking about vastly more important
things.</p>
<p>"I mean, why didn't you just <em>tell</em> them no?"</p>
<p>"Well," Harry said, as their shoes pattered across the tiles, "I
can't just go around saying 'no' every time someone asks me about
something I haven't done. I mean, suppose someone asks me, 'Harry,
did you pull the prank with the invisible paint?' and I say 'No'
and then they say 'Harry, do you know who messed with the
Gryffindor Seeker's broomstick?' and I say 'I refuse to answer that
question.' It's sort of a giveaway."</p>
<p>"And <em>that's</em> why," Hermione said carefully, "you told
everyone..." She concentrated, rembering the exact words. "That if
hypothetically there <em>was</em> a conspiracy, you could not
confirm or deny that the true master of the conspiracy was Salazar
Slytherin's ghost, and in fact you wouldn't even be able to admit
the conspiracy existed so people ought to stop asking you questions
about it."</p>
<p>"Yep," said Harry Potter, smiling slightly. "That'll teach them
to take hypothetical scenarios too seriously."</p>
<p>"And you told <em>me</em> not to answer anything -"</p>
<p>"They might not <em>believe</em> you, if you deny it," said
Harry. "So it's better to say nothing, unless you want them to
think you're a liar."</p>
<p>"But -" Hermione said helplessly. "But - but now people think
I'm <em>doing</em> things for <em>Salazar Slytherin!</em> " The way
the Gryffindors had been looking at her - the way the
<em>Slytherins</em> had been looking at her -</p>
<p>"It goes along with being a hero," Harry said. "Have you seen
what the <em>Quibbler</em> says about <em>me?</em> "</p>
<p>For a brief second Hermione imagined her parents reading a
newspaper article about her, and instead of the story being about
her winning a nationwide spelling bee or any of the other ways
she'd imagined getting into the papers, the headline said "HERMIONE
GRANGER GETS DRACO MALFOY PREGNANT".</p>
<p>It was enough to make you think twice about the whole heroine
business.</p>
<p>Harry's voice turned a bit more formal. "Speaking of which, Miss
Granger, how goes your latest quest?"</p>
<p>"Well," said Hermione, "unless the ghost of Salazar Slytherin
really <em>does</em> show up and tell us where to find bullies, I
don't think we're going to have much luck." Not that she was sorry
about that.</p>
<p>She glanced over at Harry, and saw the boy giving her a
peculiarly intense look.</p>
<p>"You know, Hermione," the boy said quietly, as though to make
sure that nobody else in the world heard, "I think you're right. I
think some people get a lot more help than others in becoming
heroes. And <em>I</em> don't think that's fair, either."</p>
<p>And Harry grabbed at her witch's robes where they lay over her
arm, and hustled her into a side-hall of the corridor they were
walking through, her mouth gaping open in surprise even as Harry's
wand came into his hand, they rounded a curve of the side-hall and
it was so narrow that it was almost pushing her and Harry into each
other, even as Harry pointed to the way they'd come and softly said
"<em>Quietus</em>", then a moment later, in the other direction,
"<em>Quietus</em>" again.</p>
<p>The boy looked searchingly around them, not just to every side,
but even upward toward the ceiling and down toward the floor.</p>
<p>And then Harry stuck a hand in his pouch and said, "Invisibility
cloak."</p>
<p>"<em>Gleep?</em> " said Hermione.</p>
<p>Harry was already drawing out folds of shimmering black fabric
from the mokeskin device. "Don't worry," the boy said with a small
grin, "they're so rare that nobody bothered to make a school rule
against them..."</p>
<p>And then Harry held out the dark velvet mesh to her, and said,
his voice strangely formal, "I do not give you, but loan you, my
cloak, unto Hermione Jean Granger. Protect her well."</p>
<p>She stared at the shimmering velvet of the cloak, cloth that
swallowed all the light that fell on it except what glinted from
small strange reflections, fabric so perfectly black it should've
shown dust or lint or <em>something</em> but it didn't, the longer
you looked the more you felt like what you were seeing wasn't
really there at all, but then you blinked again and it was just a
black cloak.</p>
<p>"Take it, Hermione."</p>
<p>Hardly even thinking, Hermione stretched out her hand to grasp
the fabric; and then just as her brain woke up and she started to
pull her hand back, Harry let go of the cloak and it started to
fall and she grabbed at it without thinking. And the instant her
fingers touched and held the cloak she felt an intangible jolt run
through her like picking up her wand for the first time; and it was
like she heard a song being sung, ever so faintly, in the back of
her mind.</p>
<p>"That's one of my quest items, Hermione," Harry said softly. "It
belonged to my father, and it's not something I can replace, if
it's lost. Don't loan it to anyone else, don't show it to anyone,
don't tell anyone it exists... but if you want to borrow it for a
while, just come to me and ask."</p>
<p>Hermione finally tore her eyes loose from the depthless black
folds and stared back up at Harry.</p>
<p>"I can't -"</p>
<p>"You certainly can," Harry said. "Because there's nothing even
the tiniest bit fair about my finding this gift-wrapped in a box
next to my bed one morning, and you... not." Harry paused
thoughtfully. "Unless you <em>did</em> get your own invisibility
cloak, in which case never mind."</p>
<p>Then the implications of <em>invisibility cloak</em> finally
dawned on her, and she pointed a shocked finger at Harry, though
they were close enough together that she couldn't quite straighten
her arm properly, and her voice rose with considerable indignation
as she said, "So <em>that's</em> how you disappeared from the
Potions closet! And the time when -" and then she trailed off,
because even <em>with</em> an invisibility cloak she still couldn't
see how Harry had...</p>
<p>Harry buffed his fingernails on his robes with artful
nonchalance, and said, "Well, you knew there had to be
<em>some</em> trick to it, right? And now the heroine will
mysteriously know where and when to find bullies - just like she
listened to the bullies planning it, even though nobody her age
could <em>possibly</em> have turned herself invisible to spy on
them."</p>
<p>There was a pause and a silence.</p>
<p>"Harry -" she said. "I'm - I'm not sure anymore that fighting
bullies is such a good idea."</p>
<p>Harry's eyes stayed steady on hers. "Because the other girls
might get hurt?"</p>
<p>She nodded, just nodded.</p>
<p>"That's <em>their</em> choice, Hermione, just like it's yours.
<em>I</em> decided not to do the obvious stupid thing that everyone
does in books, try to keep you safe and protected and helpless, and
have you get really angry at me, and push me away while you go off
on your own and get into even more trouble, and then heroically
pull through it successfully, after which I'd finally have my
epiphany and realize that blah blah blah etcetera. I know how that
part of my life story goes, so I'm just skipping over it. If I can
predict what I'm going to think later, I might as well go ahead and
think it now. Anyway, my point is, you shouldn't smother
<em>your</em> friends to keep them safe, either. Just tell them up
front it's predictably going to go horribly wrong, and if they
still want to be heroines after that, fine."</p>
<p>It was at times like this that Hermione wondered if she was
<em>ever</em> going to get used to the way Harry thought. "Harry, I
really," her voice stuck for a second, "really, <em>really</em>
don't want them getting hurt! Especially because of something I
started!"</p>
<p>"Hermione," Harry said seriously, "I'm pretty sure you did the
right thing. I don't see what could realistically happen to them
that would be <em>worse</em> for them, in the long run, than
<em>not trying</em>."</p>
<p>"What if they get <em>badly</em> hurt?" Hermione said. Her voice
felt blocked in her throat; she remembered Captain Ernie saying how
Harry had just stared straight into the eyes of a bully as the
bully bent his finger back, before Professor Sprout had arrived to
save him; and there was another thought that came after that, about
Hannah and her delicate hands with the fingernails that she
carefully painted in Hufflepuff yellow every morning, but that
wasn't allowed to be imagined. "And then - they'll never do
anything courageous, ever again -"</p>
<p>"I don't think it works like that," Harry said steadily. "Even
if it all goes mind-bogglingly wrong, I don't think it works like
that inside a human mind. The important thing is believing about
yourself that you're someone who can break your boundaries. Trying
and getting hurt can't possibly be worse for you than being...
<em>stuck</em>."</p>
<p>"What if you're <em>wrong,</em> Harry?"</p>
<p>Harry paused for a moment, and then shrugged a little sadly, and
said, "What if I'm right?"</p>
<p>Hermione looked back at the black mesh running over her hand.
From the inside the cloak felt strangely soft and yet firm against
her palm, as if it was trying to give her hand a reassuring
hug.</p>
<p>Then she lifted her arm back up, holding the cloak back to
Harry.</p>
<p>Harry didn't move to take it.</p>
<p>"I -" said Hermione. "I mean, thank you, thank you a lot, but
I'm still thinking about it, so you can take it back for now.
And... Harry, I don't think it's right to <em>spy</em> on people
-"</p>
<p>"Not even on known bullies, to rescue their victims?" Harry
said. "<em>I've</em> never been bullied, but I've been through a
realistic simulation, and it didn't feel very pleasant. Have you
ever been bullied, Hermione?"</p>
<p>"No," she said in a quiet voice, and went on holding out Harry's
invisibility cloak to him.</p>
<p>Finally Harry took back his cloak - she felt a small twitch of
loss as the inaudible song vanished from the back of her mind - and
started to stuff the black material back into his pouch.</p>
<p>As the pouch ate the last of the fabric, Harry turned from her,
to break the Quieting Barrier -</p>
<p>"And, um," Hermione said. "That's not <em>the</em> Cloak of
Invisibility, is it? The one we read about in the library on page
eighteen of Paula Vieira's translation of Gottschalk's <em>An
Illustrated Scroll of Lost Devices</em>?"</p>
<p>Harry turned his head back, grinning slightly, and said in
exactly the same tone of voice he'd used earlier with the other
students at dinner, "I cannot confirm or deny that I possess
magical artifacts of incredible power."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>When Hermione climbed into bed that night she was still trying
to decide. Her life had been simpler at dinnertime, back when there
hadn't <em>been</em> any practical way for them to find bullies;
and now she had to choose again; not for herself, this time, but
for her friends. In her mind's eye she kept seeing Dumbledore's
lined face and the pain it hadn't quite hidden, and in her mind's
ears she kept hearing Harry's voice saying 'That's their choice,
Hermione, just like it's yours.'</p>
<p>And her hand kept remembering the sensation of the cloak against
her fingers, replaying it over and over in her mind. There was a
power to the feeling that compelled her thoughts to return to it,
and to the song she'd heard / hadn't heard in a part of her mind
and magic which now lay silent once more.</p>
<p>Harry had spoken to the cloak like it was a <em>person</em>,
telling it to take good care of her. Harry had said the cloak had
belonged to his father, that he couldn't replace it if it was
lost...</p>
<p>But... Harry wouldn't <em>really</em> do that, would he?</p>
<p>Just <em>hand</em> her one of the three Deathly Hallows created
centuries before Hogwarts?</p>
<p>She could say that she felt flattered, but this went
<em>way</em> beyond feeling flattered, into making her wonder just
what she was to Harry, exactly.</p>
<p>Maybe Harry was the sort of person who went around loaning
ancient lost magical artifacts to <em>anyone</em> he considered a
friend, but -</p>
<p>But when she thought about <em>which</em> part of his life Harry
had said he'd skipped over, the part where he tried to keep her
safe and protected...</p>
<p>Hermione stared up at the ceiling of the Ravenclaw dorm.
Somewhere beyond her bed, Mandy and Su were talking. She'd turned
up her Quieting Charm to where she couldn't hear the exact words,
but could still hear their faint murmur; there was something
comforting about sleeping in a dorm with the other girls. Harry
kept his own Quieter turned up all the way, she knew.</p>
<p>She was starting to wonder if maybe Harry actually <em>did</em>,
well...</p>
<p>You know...</p>
<p><em>Like</em> her.</p>
<p>It took Hermione Granger a long time to fall asleep that
night.</p>
<p>And when she woke up the next morning there was a small slip of
parchment peeking out from under her pillow which said <em>At
half-past ten you will find a bully in the fourth passageway to the
left of the hall leaving the Potions classroom - S.</em></p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>When Hermione entered the Great Hall that morning, her stomach
was filled with flying butterflies the size of Hippogriffs; even as
she approached the Ravenclaw breakfast table she still hadn't
decided what to <em>do.</em></p>
<p>There was an empty place next to Padma, she saw. That would be
where to sit down, if she was going to tell Padma and then ask
Padma to tell Daphne and Tracey.</p>
<p>Hermione walked toward the empty place next to Padma.</p>
<p>There were words waiting in her throat, <em>Padma, I got a</em>
<em>mysterious</em> <em>message -</em></p>
<p>And she could feel a huge brick wall inside her, stopping the
words from coming out. She'd be putting Hannah and Susan and Daphne
<em>in danger</em>. Taking them and leading them by the hand
straight into trouble. That was Wrong.</p>
<p>Or she could just go try to handle the bully herself, without
telling her friends anything, and that, quite obviously, was also
Wrong.</p>
<p>Hermione knew she was being faced with a Moral Dilemma, just
like all those wizards and witches she'd read about in stories.
Only in stories people always got a <em>right</em> choice and a
wrong choice, not two wrong ones, which seemed a bit unfair. But
she had the sense, somehow - maybe it came from the way Harry
always talked about how the history books would see them - that she
was faced with a Heroic Decision, and that her whole life might end
up going one way or another, depending on what she chose right now,
<em>this morning</em>.</p>
<p>Hermione sat down at the table without looking to either side,
just gazing at the plate and silverware like they might have
answers hidden inside, thinking as hard as she ever had, and a few
seconds later she heard Padma's voice whispering almost in her ear,
"Daphne says she knows where a bully's going to be at ten-thirty
today."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Doomed.</p>
<p>They were all doomed, in Susan Bones's opinion.</p>
<p>Auntie sometimes told stories which started out like this,
people doing something they <em>knew</em> was stupid, and the
stories usually ended with someone being <em>doomed</em> all over
the floor and all over the walls and getting on Auntie's shoes.</p>
<p>"Hey, Padma," muttered Parvati, her voice just barely audible
over the soft impacts of eight girls tiptoeing through the corridor
leading to the Potions classroom, "d'you know why Hermione's been
sighing all morning -"</p>
<p>"No talking!" hissed Lavender, the harsh whisper sounding much
louder than Parvati's mutter. "You never know when Evil might be
listening!"</p>
<p><em>"Shhh!</em> " said three other girls even more loudly.</p>
<p>Utterly, totally, quite extremely doomed.</p>
<p>As they approached the fourth passageway to the left of the
Potions classroom, where Daphne's mysterious informant had said the
bullying would take place, the eight of them moved slower, the
sound of their feet got softer, and finally General Granger made
the gesture that meant <em>Halt, I'll look ahead</em>.</p>
<p>Lavender raised a hand, then, and when Hermione turned to look
at her, Lavender, looking puzzled, pointed straight down the
corridor, gestured to herself, and then tried to sign something
else that Susan didn't understand -</p>
<p>General Granger shook her head, and once again, this time with
slower, more exaggerated movements, made the sign for <em>Halt,
I'll look ahead</em>.</p>
<p>Lavender, looking even more puzzled, pointed back the way they'd
come, and made a bouncing gesture with her other hand.</p>
<p>Now everyone else was looking even more confused than Lavender,
and Susan thought with some acerbity that evidently one hour of
practice done two days ago wasn't enough to remember a new set of
code signals.</p>
<p>Hermione pointed at Lavender, then at the floor beneath
Lavender's feet, the expression on her face making it very clear
that the intended meaning was <em>You. Stay. Here.</em></p>
<p>Lavender nodded.</p>
<p><em>Doom doom doom,</em> went the words of the Chaos Legion's
marching song through Susan's mind, <em>doom doom doom doom doom
doom</em>...</p>
<p>Hermione reached into her robes, and drew out a little rod with
a mirror on the end of it and an eyepiece. Very very softly indeed,
the Ravenclaw girl crept up to the wall, right next to where the
passageway opened off the corridor, and peeked just the tip of the
eyepiece around the corner.</p>
<p>Then a little more.</p>
<p>Then a little more.</p>
<p>Then General Granger cautiously stuck her head around the
side.</p>
<p>General Granger turned back to them, nodded, and made the hand
gesture for <em>follow me</em>.</p>
<p>Susan felt a little better as she crept forward. The part of the
Plan which called for them to arrive thirty minutes before the
bully had, apparently, actually worked. Maybe they were only
<em>slightly</em> doomed...?</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>At ten-twenty-nine, almost on the dot, the bully showed up. If
anyone had been present to hear - though the corridor was
apparently empty - they would have heard his shoes clicking solidly
through the main corridor, entering the passageway, walking toward
where the passageway turned its first corner, turning that corner,
and then stopping in some surprise upon seeing that the passageway
now terminated in a solid brick wall where no wall had been
before.</p>
<p>Then the bully shrugged and turned away, as he leaned back to
watch the main passage from just around the corner.</p>
<p>It <em>was</em> the castle Hogwarts, after all.</p>
<p>Behind the hastily Transfigured thin panels they'd assembled
into the outward appearance of a brick wall, the girls waited; not
speaking, not moving, hardly even breathing, but watching through
the eyeholes they'd left themselves.</p>
<p>As Susan's gaze took in the bully, she could feel the tightening
of her chest all the way into her toes. The boy looked to be in his
seventh-year if not <em>older</em>, and his robes were trimmed in
green instead of the red they'd been hoping for, and he had
<em>muscles</em>, and after staring for a bit longer, Susan
realized his stance had the balance that meant that he
<em>dueled</em>.</p>
<p>Then they all heard the sound of more feet approaching from the
corridor. The fourth-year Gryffindors and Slytherins had just been
let out of Potions class.</p>
<p>The footsteps pattered past, and diminished and faded, and the
bully didn't do anything. For a moment Susan felt an instant of
relief -</p>
<p>Then another, smaller group of footsteps approached.</p>
<p>The bully still didn't do anything, as the footsteps went
past.</p>
<p>That happened a few more times.</p>
<p>And then, as there approached the faintly audible sound of one
last set of footsteps, the seven girls heard the bully's voice
saying, clear and cold and quiet, "<em>Protego</em>".</p>
<p>Someone <em>did</em> gasp then, though fortunately very very
quietly. If they couldn't get in even a single shot -</p>
<p>The bullies were learning <em>already</em>, Susan realized, she
hadn't expected S.P.H.E.W. to be able to do this very often before
the bullies caught on - but - Hermione had already defeated three
bullies - and the school had been buzzing with speculation about
Salazar Slytherin's ghost, yesterday -</p>
<p><em>He's expecting us!</em></p>
<p>Susan would have whispered to give up, to abort the plan, only
there was no way to convey a message to -</p>
<p>"<em>Silencio</em>," said the bully in a soft, deliberate voice
with his wand pointed toward the corridor, the blue haze of his
Shielding Charm shimmering around him. "<em>Accio</em> victim."</p>
<p>When the fourth-year boy came into their field of vision he was
dangling upside down as if an invisible hand were holding him high
by one leg, his red-trimmed robes beginning to slide down his
thighs to reveal the pants beneath. His mouth was opening and
closing helpessly, no sound coming out.</p>
<p>"I suppose you're wondering what's going on," the seventh-year
Slytherin said in a quiet, cold voice. "Don't worry. It's so simple
even a Gryffindor could understand."</p>
<p>With that, the Slytherin's left hand formed a fist and drove
hard into the Gryffindor's belly. The fourth-year boy's body jerked
around frantically, but still no words left his mouth.</p>
<p>"You're my victim," said the older Slytherin. "I'm a bully. I'm
going to beat you up. And we'll see if anyone stops me."</p>
<p>It was at that moment that Susan realized it was a trap.</p>
<p>And in almost the same moment, there rang out the mighty and
high-pitched voice of a young girl, crying, "<em>Stop, evildoer!
Finite Incantatem!</em> "</p>
<p><em>Lavender</em>, thought Susan, agonized. The Gryffindor girl
had volunteered to be a distraction, while the rest of them
executed a flank attack from where the bully wouldn't expect it,
that had been the plan, only now -</p>
<p>"In the name of Hogwarts," cried Lavender's voice, though they
couldn't see her, "and in the name of heroines everywhere, I
command you to let go of that EEK!"</p>
<p>"<em>Expelliarmus</em>," said the bully. "<em>Stupefy</em>.
<em>Accio</em> stupid heroine."</p>
<p>When Lavender floated into their vision, dangling by one foot
and unconscious, Susan blinked; the girl was dressed in a bright
crimson-and-gold skirt and blouse, instead of her usual Hogwarts
robes.</p>
<p>The bully was also giving the girl's upside-down body an odd
look, and then he pointed his wand at her and said "<em>Finite
Incantatem</em>," but the clothes stayed the same.</p>
<p>Then the bully shrugged, and, still facing in the direction of
Lavender instead of the dangling fourth-year boy, drew back his
fist -</p>
<p>"<em>Lagann!</em> " yelled five voices, and five green spirals
blasted from five wands aimed through five holes in the false wall,
and an instant later Hermione's voice shouted
"<em>Stupefy!</em> "</p>
<p>Five green spirals shattered ineffectually on blue haze, and
Hermione's red bolt bounced off the haze and struck the fourth-year
boy, who jerked and then was still.</p>
<p>And the seventh-year bully turned around, smiling grimly, as the
first-year girls screamed and charged.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Susan's eyes flew open and instantly she was rolling away from
where she'd lain on the floor, her lungs still on fire and her
whole body still aching from when she'd been hit, the battle had
only moved forward a few seconds from what she could see, Hannah's
body falling with her arm still stretched out toward Susan,
"<em>Glisseo!</em> " shouted Hermione but the older boy just
slashed his wand down leaving a trail of green glow behind and
Hermione's Charm visibly disrupted into a shower of blue-white
sparks, then in almost the same motion the bully said
"<em>Stupefy!</em> " and Hermione was blown backward and Susan
summoned up all the magic she had left and shouted
"<em>Innervate!</em> " at Hermione's body even as the bully turned
toward her, the bully's wand pointed in her direction again and
then Padma yelled "<em>Prismatis!</em> " just before the bully
shouted "<em>Impedimenta!</em> ", the rainbow sphere forming
<em>around the bully</em> and the seventh-year Slytherin staggered
as his own hex was reflected back at him, but an instant later the
bully's wand swept back to tap himself and then Padma's Prismatic
Sphere shattered like a blown soap bubble as the bully's wand cut
through it and "<em>Innervate!</em> " yelled Parvati at Hannah's
body and Tracey and Lavender screamed at the same time,
"<em>Wingardium Leviosa!</em> " -</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Hannah Abbott held out her wand with a hand that trembled with
exhaustion, she didn't have enough magic left for even one
<em>Innervate</em>, now.</p>
<p>The rest of the passageway was silent, scattered bodies lying
across the ground, Padma and Tracey and Lavender, Hermione and
Parvati in a heap against one wall, Susan standing in petrified
rigor as her eyes tracked it all helplessly, even the Gryffindor
boy lying sprawled and motionless (Hermione had woken him and he'd
fought, but it hadn't been enough).</p>
<p>It had been a very short battle.</p>
<p>The bully was still smiling, the only signs of his exertion a
wavering ripple in the blue glow surrounding him, and a few beads
of sweat on his forehead.</p>
<p>The bully raised his arm, wiped the sweat off his forehead, and
stalked toward her like a man-shaped living Lethifold.</p>
<p>Hannah turned and fled, spun and ran with screams kept bound in
her choking throat, sprinted past the fallen paneling of the fake
brick wall, ran down the passageway with all the speed she could
muster, weaving as much as she could -</p>
<p>Just before Hannah got to the turn in the passageway, the
bully's voice from behind her said "<em>Cluthe!</em> " and she got
awful cramps all through her legs, she fell down and slid and hit
her head against the wall, only she didn't even notice the pain of
the smack as she started to scream with the twisting muscles -</p>
<p>The bully was still stalking toward her, Hannah saw as she
turned her head; approaching her slowly, still wearing that
dreadful smile.</p>
<p>And she rolled, despite the pain as her leg muscles knotted up
around themselves, she rolled around the corner of the passageway,
and screamed, "Go <em>away!</em> "</p>
<p>"I think not," said the bully, his voice deep and scary like
that of a grown man, sounding very close at hand now.</p>
<p>The bully walked around the corner and Daphne Greengrass stabbed
her Most Ancient Blade directly into his groin.</p>
<p>There was a flash that lit up the whole corridor -</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>It was with a subdued mien that seven girls left Madam Pomfrey's
office, leaving one of their own behind in a hospital bed.</p>
<p>Hannah would be all right in about thirty-five minutes, the
healer had said; torn muscles were easy to mend.</p>
<p>Daphne had done all the talking, and according to her, Hannah
had suffered a mishap with a Road-Running Charm which had caused
the leg cramps. Madam Pomfrey had given them a sharp look but
hadn't argued, even though that Charm was around six years above
their level.</p>
<p>Madam Pomfrey had also given Daphne a potion to help with her
state of total magical exhaustion, and warned her not to cast any
spells for the next three hours. That, supposedly, was from Daphne
using up too much magic trying to <em>Finite</em> Hannah, rather
than the Most Ancient Blade drawing out all of her power to break
the <em>Protego</em>.</p>
<p>The rest of them had decided not to say anything about the
bruises under their robes until they could get some older girls to
cast <em>Episkey</em>. There were limits to what Daphne could talk
around.</p>
<p>The whole thing, Susan thought, had been too close, much too
close. If the bully had so much as looked around the corner - if
he'd taken a moment to recast his Shielding Charm -</p>
<p>"We should stop," said Susan, as soon as the seven of them had
gotten out of hearing range of the healer's office. "We should stop
doing this."</p>
<p>For some reason, then, even though they were supposed to vote on
this sort of thing, everyone turned to look at General Granger.</p>
<p>The Sunshine General didn't seem to see them looking at her, she
just strode on, gazing off straight ahead.</p>
<p>After a little while, Hermione Granger said, in a voice that
sounded thoughtful and a little sad, "Hannah said <em>she</em>
didn't want us to stop. I'm not sure it's right for us to... be
less brave <em>for</em> her, than she is."</p>
<p>All the other girls, except Susan, nodded at that.</p>
<p>"I think that's got to be as bad as it gets," said Parvati. "And
we can handle it. We've proved that now."</p>
<p>Susan couldn't think of anything to say to that. She didn't
think that shrieking at the top of her lungs about blatant
stupidity and DOOM would be persuasive. And she couldn't just
<em>leave</em> the other girls, either. Wasn't it enough to be
cursed with hard work, why did Hufflepuffs have to be
<em>loyal</em> on top of everything else?</p>
<p>"By the way, Lavender," said Padma. "What in the name of
Merlin's underpants were you <em>wearing</em> back there?"</p>
<p>"My hero outfit," said the Gryffindor girl.</p>
<p>Daphne sounded weary, as she spoke without turning her own head
from where she was plodding through the hall. "It's the costume of
the Soldier of Gryffindor from the play <em>Chronicles of the
Lunarian Soldiers</em>."</p>
<p>"Did you Transfigure it?" said Parvati, looking puzzled. "But
the bully cast <em>Finite</em> on you -"</p>
<p>"Nope!" Lavender said. "It's <em>real!</em> See, I just
Transfigured my hero outfit into a regular shirt and skirt
<em>beforehand</em>, so all I had to do was cast <em>Finite</em> on
myself after I saw the bully. Do you want your own, Parvati? I got
mine made yesterday by Katarina and Joshua in sixth-year, for
twelve Sickles -"</p>
<p>"I think," General Granger said in a careful voice, "that would
make us all look a little silly."</p>
<p>"Well," said Lavender, "we should vote on whether to -"</p>
<p>"I think," General Granger said, "that no matter what
<em>anyone</em> votes, I'm not going to be caught <em>dead</em>
wearing one of those costumes -"</p>
<p>Susan ignored the argument. She was trying to think up some sort
of clever strategy for being less doomed.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The whole Great Hall went silent, even if only for a moment, as
the seven of them walked into lunch.</p>
<p>Then the applause started.</p>
<p>It was scattered, not the massive applause of everyone
applauding at once. A lot of it came from the Gryffindor table,
less from Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw, and none from Slytherin.</p>
<p>Daphne felt her face tightening. She'd <em>hoped</em> - well,
maybe after they found a Gryffindor bully to stop and a Slytherin
to rescue, her fellow Slytherins would realize -</p>
<p>She looked at the Hufflepuff table.</p>
<p>Neville Longbottom was applauding with his hands held high above
his head, although he wasn't smiling. Maybe he'd heard about
Hannah, or maybe he was wondering why Hannah wasn't there.</p>
<p>Then, not quite able to help herself, she glanced toward the
Head Table.</p>
<p>Professor Sprout's face was lined with concern. She and
Professor McGonagall were leaning their heads toward Headmaster
Dumbledore, who had a solemn look, and all their lips were moving
quickly. Professor Flitwick looked more resigned than anything
else, and Quirrell, face slack, was taking trembling stabs at his
soup using a spoon gripped in a fist.</p>
<p>Professor Snape was looking directly at -</p>
<p><em>Her?</em></p>
<p>Or - at Hermione Granger, standing next to her?</p>
<p>A small, thin smile crossed the Potions Master's face, and he
raised his hands, brought them together once in a motion that was
too slow to be a real clap; and then the Potions Master turned back
to his plate, ignoring the conversations around him.</p>
<p>Daphne felt a little chill go down her spine, and she hastily
turned to walk toward the Slytherin table. Susan and Lavender and
Parvati peeled off from their group, heading toward the Hufflepuff
and Gryffindor tables on the other side of the Great Hall.</p>
<p>It happened as they were passing the part of the Slytherin table
where the Slytherin Quidditch team sat.</p>
<p>That was when Hermione stumbled suddenly, stumbled <em>hard</em>
like she was being yanked off her feet, and went sprawling into the
gap between where Marcus Flint and Lucian Bole sat, and there was a
sad little splutching sound as Hermione's face ended up in Flint's
plate of steak and mashed potatoes.</p>
<p>Everything seemed to happen too quickly then, or maybe it was
just Daphne herself who was thinking too slow, as Flint let out a
bellow of indignation and his hand yanked Hermione back and threw
her into the Ravenclaw table, and she bounced off a student's back
and collapsed onto the ground -</p>
<p>The quiet spread out in ripples.</p>
<p>Hermione pushed herself up on her hands, though she didn't get
all the way to her feet, Daphne could see that her whole body was
shaking, and that her face was still covered with mashed potatoes
with scattered pieces of steak.</p>
<p>For a long moment, nobody spoke, nobody moved. Like nobody in
the whole Great Hall could imagine, any more than Daphne could,
what happened next.</p>
<p>Then Flint's powerful voice, the voice of the Slytherin Captain
that bellowed commands on the Quidditch pitch, said in a dangerous
rumble, "You ruined my food, girl."</p>
<p>Another moment of frozen silence. Hermione's head - Daphne could
see it trembling - turned to look at the Slytherin Quidditch
Captain.</p>
<p>"Apologize to me," said Flint.</p>
<p>Harry Potter started to push himself up from the Ravenclaw
table, and then stopped abruptly, halfway to his feet, as if he'd
just thought of something -</p>
<p>Then five other people stood up from the Ravenclaw table.</p>
<p>All of the Slytherin Quidditch team stood up, their wands coming
into their hands, and then students stood up at the Gryffindor
table and at the Hufflepuff table and without thinking Daphne
turned to look at the Head Table and she saw that the Headmaster
was still sitting down, watching, just watching, Dumbledore was
<em>just watching</em> and he had one hand out as though to
restrain Professor McGonagall - in just one second someone would
shout a spell and then it would be too late, <em>why wasn't the
Headmaster doing anything</em> -</p>
<p>And a voice said, "My apologies."</p>
<p>Daphne turned back to look, her mouth gaping open in absolute
shock.</p>
<p>"<em>Scourgify</em>," said that smooth voice, and the mashed
potatoes vanished from Hermione's face, revealing the Ravenclaw's
surprised expression as Draco Malfoy approached her, sheathed his
wand again, and then knelt to one knee beside her and offered her a
hand.</p>
<p>"Sorry about that, Miss Granger," said Draco Malfoy's polite
voice. "I guess someone thought they were being funny."</p>
<p>Hermione took Draco's hand, and Daphne suddenly realized what
was about to happen -</p>
<p>But Draco Malfoy <em>didn't</em> raise Hermione halfway up and
then drop her.</p>
<p>He just pulled her to her feet.</p>
<p>"Thanks," said Hermione.</p>
<p>"You're welcome," Draco Malfoy said in a loud voice, not looking
to either side to see where all four Houses of Hogwarts were
staring at him in total shock. "Just remember, being cunning and
ambitious doesn't mean you have to be like that."</p>
<p>And then Draco Malfoy went back to his seat at the Slytherin
bench and sat down like he hadn't - he hadn't just - <em>he'd
just</em> -</p>
<p>Hermione went to the nearest empty place at the Ravenclaw bench
and sat down.</p>
<p>A number of other people, rather slowly, sat down.</p>
<p>"Daphne?" said Tracey. "Are you all right?"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Draco's heart was hammering in his chest so hard he worried it
might explode right out of his chest in a shower of blood, like
that curse Amycus Carrow had used once on a puppy.</p>
<p>Draco's face stayed completely controlled, because he knew (it'd
been drilled into him over and over) that if he showed the
slightest sign of the fear he was feeling, his Housemates would rip
him apart like a swarm of Acromantulas.</p>
<p>There'd been no time to check with Harry Potter, no time to
plot, no time to think, just the instant of realizing that the time
to start rescuing Slytherin's reputation was <em>right
then</em>.</p>
<p>From all sides of the long Slytherin table, angry faces stared
at Draco.</p>
<p>But they were outnumbered by the faces that just looked
puzzled.</p>
<p>"All right, I give up," said a sixth-year boy that Draco didn't
recognize, sitting across from him and two places to his right.
"Why did you do that, Malfoy?"</p>
<p>Although his mouth was very dry, Draco didn't swallow. That
would have been a sign of fear. Instead he took a bite of carrots,
which had the most moisture of anything on his plate, and chewed
and swallowed, thinking as rapidly as he could.</p>
<p>"You know," Draco said, making his voice as cutting as he could
- as his heart thumped even harder in his chest, as everyone around
him stopped talking to listen - "there's <em>probably</em> some way
to make Slytherin look even <em>worse</em> than attacking eight
first-year girls from all four Houses who are working together to
stop bullies, but I can't think of <em>how</em>. This way we get
the benefit of what Greengrass is doing."</p>
<p>The puzzled faces stayed puzzled.</p>
<p>"What?" said the sixth-year boy, and "Wait, <em>what</em>
benefit?" said a fifth-year girl sitting to his right.</p>
<p>"It makes Slytherin House look better," said Draco.</p>
<p>The Slytherins around him were giving him quizzical gazes like
he'd just tried to explain algebra.</p>
<p>"Look better to <em>who?</em> " said the sixth-year boy.</p>
<p>"But you just helped a <em>mudblood</em>," said the fifth-year
girl. "How's <em>that s</em>upposed to look good?"</p>
<p>Draco's throat closed up. His brain was experiencing a hideous
malfunction during which it couldn't think of anything to say
except the truth -</p>
<p>Then, "It's probably some kind of tremendously clever scheme
Malfoy's got going," said a fifth-year boy. "You know, like in
<em>The Tragedy of Light</em>, where everything that looks like a
setback is part of the plot. And it ends with Granger's head on a
stick and nobody suspecting that it was him."</p>
<p>"<em>That</em> makes sense," someone said from further down the
table, and there was a lot of nodding.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"Do <em>you</em> know what the boss's up to?" Vincent muttered
in an undertone.</p>
<p>Gregory Goyle didn't reply. In his mind he could hear very
clearly his master's voice, saying, <em>I can't believe I believed
every word of that</em>, the day the rumor had started about
Salazar Slytherin showing Potter and Granger where to find
bullies.</p>
<p>"Mr. Goyle?" whispered Vincent.</p>
<p>Gregory Goyle's lips shaped the words, <em>Oh no,</em> but no
sound came out.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Hermione had left lunch early that day, for some reason she
hadn't felt hungry. Those few seconds of horrible humiliation had
kept burning through her mind, over and over, the feeling of her
face squishing into the mashed potatoes and then being thrown
through the air and then the Slytherin's boy's voice saying
'Apologize to me'... it might have been the first time in her whole
life that she'd felt like <em>hating</em> someone. The boy who'd
thrown her (Marcus Flint, they'd said his name was) and whoever had
cast the tripping Jinx on her in the first place... she'd felt it,
for one horrible instant she'd wanted to go tell Harry that if he
started getting <em>creative</em> on her behalf, she wouldn't
object.</p>
<p>She hadn't been a minute out of the Great Hall before she'd
heard the sound of running feet behind, and turned to see Daphne
racing toward her.</p>
<p>And listened to what her Sunshine Soldier had to say...</p>
<p>"Don't you <em>understand?</em> " Daphne's voice was barely
below a shriek. "Just because someone's nice to you doesn't mean
they're your friend! He's <em>Draco Malfoy!</em> His father's a
Death Eater, all the parents of all his friends are Death Eaters -
Nott, Goyle, Crabbe, <em>everyone around him</em>, do you get it?
They <em>all</em> despise Muggleborns, they want everyone like you
to <em>die</em>, they think you're good for nothing but being a
<em>sacrifice</em> in horrible Dark rituals! Draco is <em>the next
Lord Malfoy</em>, he's been raised from birth to hate you and he's
been raised from birth to <em>lie!</em> " Daphne's gray-green eyes
stared fiercely at her, demanding assent and understanding.</p>
<p>"He -" Hermione said falteringly. She remembered the rooftop,
the awful jolt as she started to fall, Draco Malfoy's hand grabbing
hers and holding it so hard that she'd had bruises afterward. She'd
had to tell him twice before he finally let her fall. "Maybe Draco
Malfoy isn't like them -"</p>
<p>Daphne's whisper was almost a scream. "If he <em>doesn't</em>
end up doing you ten times as hard as he just helped you, his
<em>life</em> is <em>over</em>, do you understand? I mean Lucius
Malfoy would <em>literally</em> disinherit him! D'you know what the
chance is that he's <em>not</em> up to something?"</p>
<p>"Tiny?" said Hermione in a small voice.</p>
<p>"<em>Zero!</em> " hissed Daphne. "I mean <em>none!</em> I mean
<em>less</em> than zero! I mean the chance is so small that you
couldn't find it with three Magnifying Charms and a Point-Me spell
and - and - and an ancient map and a centaur prophet! Everyone in
Slytherin knows he's plotting to do something to you and doesn't
want to be suspected, I heard someone say he was seen pointing his
wand at you just before you tripped - don't you <em>see?</em>
<em>This is all part of Malfoy's plan!</em> "</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Draco sat eating his steak with roasted cauliflower florets and
Ashwinder sauce (it wasn't made from real Ashwinder eggs, it just
tasted like fire), trying not to laugh and trying not to cry.</p>
<p>He'd <em>heard</em> about plausible deniability, but hadn't
realized how much it mattered until he found that Malfoys didn't
have any.</p>
<p>"You want to know my plot?" said Draco. "<em>Here's</em> my
plot. I'm not going to do <em>anything</em> and then the
<em>next</em> time people think I'm plotting something, they won't
be sure."</p>
<p>"Huh..." said the fifth-year boy. "I don't think I believe you,
that doesn't sound cunning enough to be really it -"</p>
<p>"That's what he <em>wants</em> you to think," said the
fifth-year girl.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"Albus," Minerva said dangerously, "did you <em>plan</em> all
this?"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"Well, if I <em>did</em> snap my fingers under the table, I
wouldn't just <em>tell</em> you that -"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The Defense Professor's quavering hand dropped his spoon into
the soup again.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"What do you mean, <em>set you up?</em> " said Millicent. The
two of them were sitting cross-legged on Daphne's bed, having come
there straight from the Great Hall after lunch. "With my Seer's
eyes that stare through Time Itself, I saw you
<em>winning</em>."</p>
<p>Daphne stared at Millicent, her own merely mortal eyes rather
narrowed at the moment. "That boy was <em>expecting</em> us."</p>
<p>"Well, yeah!" said Millicent. "Everyone knows you're hunting
bullies!"</p>
<p>"Hannah got hit by a really painful hex," Daphne said. "She had
to visit a healer, Millicent! If we're friends you should've
<em>warned</em> me!"</p>
<p>"Look, Daphne, I <em>told</em> you -" The Slytherin girl paused,
as if trying to remember something, and then said, "I mean, I told
you, what I See <em>has</em> to come to pass. If I try to change
it, if <em>anyone</em> tries to change it, really terrible, awful,
no good, extremely bad things will happen. And then it'll come to
pass <em>anyway</em>. If I See you getting beaten up, I
<em>can't</em> tell you that, because then you'd try to <em>not
go</em>, and <em>then</em> -" Millicent stopped.</p>
<p>"And then?" Daphne said skeptically. "I mean, what happens if we
just don't go?"</p>
<p>"I don't <em>know!</em> " said Millicent. "But it probably makes
being eaten by Lethifolds look like a tea party!"</p>
<p>"Look, even I know that's not how prophecies work," Daphne said,
then paused. "At least prophecies don't work like that in plays..."
Admittedly, there were all sorts of tragedies where trying to avoid
a prophecy <em>made</em> it happen, or where, on the other hand,
trying to <em>go along</em> with a prophecy was the only reason why
it happened. But you <em>could</em> make prophecies happen your own
way if you were clever enough; or someone who loved you enough
could take your place; or with enough effort it was possible to
break a prophecy outright... Then again, in plays the Seers never
remembered what they Saw, either...</p>
<p>Millicent must have seen Daphne's hesitation, because the other
girl started looking a little more confident. "Well," Millicent
said sharply, "this isn't a play! Look, I'll tell you if I See it
being a hard battle or an easy one. But that's <em>all</em> I can
do, you understand? And if I say 'hard' you <em>can't</em> not show
up! Or - or -" Millicent's eyes rolled back in her head, and she
intoned hollowly, "<em>Those who try to cheat their destinies will
come to sad and gloomy ends -"</em></p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Professor Sprout shook her head, her face looking tight.</p>
<p>"But -" said Susan. "But you helped <em>Harry Potter</em> that
one time -"</p>
<p>"And it was made <em>quite clear</em> to me," Professor Sprout
said in a voice that sounded like someone was using a Shrinking
Charm to squeeze her throat, "that it was Professor Snape's job,
and not mine, to keep order in Slytherin House - Miss Bones,
<em>please</em>, you don't have to <em>do</em> this if -"</p>
<p>"Yes, I <em>do</em> have to," Susan said unhappily. "I'm a
Hufflepuff, we have to be loyal."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"A mysterious parchment under your pillow?" said Harry Potter,
looking up from where he was sitting, in the Quieted nook where
they were studying. Then the boy's green eyes narrowed. "It wasn't
from Santa Claus, was it?"</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>"Okay," said Hermione. "I'm <em>not</em> going to ask, and
you're <em>not</em> going to tell me, and we're <em>both</em> going
to pretend you never said that and I don't know anything about it
-"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Susan approached the table as soon as the older girl was alone,
glancing around the Hufflepuff common room to make sure nobody was
watching (the way Auntie had taught her to do it, so that it
wouldn't be obvious that she was looking).</p>
<p>"Hey, Susie," said the seventh-year Hufflepuff. "Do you already
need more -"</p>
<p>"Can I please talk to you privately for a bit?" Susan said.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Jaime Astorga, seventh-year of Slytherin, and until recently
considered a promising upstart on the youth dueling circuit, stood
ramrod straight in Professor Snape's office, with his teeth
clenched tight and sweat trickling down his spine.</p>
<p>"I distinctly recall," said the Head of his House in a sardonic
drawl, "that I warned you, and a number of others this very
morning, that there were certain first-year girls who might prove
annoying, if a fighter were <em>incautious</em> and allowed himself
to be <em>taken by surprise</em>."</p>
<p>Professor Snape stalked in a slow circle around him.</p>
<p>"I -" said Jaime, as more sweat beaded on his forehead. He knew
how ridiculous it sounded, how much of a pathetic excuse. "Sir,
they shouldn't have been able to -" One first-year-girl shouldn't
have been able to break his <em>Protego</em>, no matter what sort
of ancient Charm she used - Greengrass must have had <em>help</em>
-</p>
<p>But it was very clear that his Head of House wouldn't believe
that.</p>
<p>"Oh, I quite agree," murmured Snape in a low tone, instinct with
menace. "They shouldn't have. I begin to wonder if Mr. Malfoy,
whatever his plotting, has a point, Astorga. It cannot be good for
the repute of Slytherin's House if our fighters, rather than
demonstrating their strength, lose to little girls!" Snape's voice
had risen. "It is well that you had the good taste to be defeated
by a little girl who is a fellow Slytherin of a Noble House,
Astorga, or I would deduct points from you myself!"</p>
<p>Jaime Astorga's fists clenched at his side, but he couldn't
think of a thing to say.</p>
<p>It was some time before Jaime Astorga was allowed to leave the
presence of his Head of House.</p>
<p>And afterward, only the walls, the floor, and the ceiling saw
Severus Snape's smile.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>That evening Draco was visited by his father's owl, Tanaxu, who
wasn't green but only because there weren't such things as green
owls. The best Father had been able to find was an owl of the
purest silver feathers, with great luminous green eyes, and a beak
as sharp and cruel as any snake's fang. The parchment wrapped
around Tanaxu's leg was short and to the point:</p>
<p><em>What are you doing, my son?</em></p>
<p>The parchment that Draco sent back was equally short, and it
said,</p>
<p><em>I am trying to stop harm done to Slytherin's reputation,
father.</em></p>
<p>In as much time as it took for an owl to fly from Hogwarts to
Malfoy Manor and back again, the family owl bore another message to
Draco, and this one said only:</p>
<p><em>What are you really doing?</em></p>
<p>Draco stared at the parchment he'd unwrapped from the owl's leg.
His hands trembled, as he held up the parchment to the light of his
fireplace. Five words, carved in black ink, shouldn't have been
scarier than death.</p>
<p>There wasn't very much time to think. Father knew exactly how
long it took for a message to go from Malfoy Manor to Hogwarts and
back again; he would know if Draco delayed to compose a careful
lie.</p>
<p>But Draco still waited until his hand stopped trembling, before
he wrote his reply, the only answer he'd thought of that Father
might accept.</p>
<p><em>I am preparing for the next war.</em></p>
<p>Draco wrapped that parchment around the owl's leg and tied it,
and then sent Tanaxu winging out from his room, through the halls
of Hogwarts, into the night.</p>
<p>He waited, but no reply came.</p>

Pt 8<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p><em>The red jet of fire took Hannah full in the face, flipping
her end-over-heels and smacking her head straight into the stone
wall, where her pale face seemed to linger for an instant, framed
by flying strands of brown-golden hair, before she collapsed to the
ground in a heap of robes, as the third and final volley of blazing
green spirals brought down their foe's Shield Charm.</em></p>
<p>The March days marched by, filled with lectures and study and
homework, breakfast and lunch and dinner.</p>
<p><em>The Gryffindor boy stared at the eight of them, tension in
every line of his body's frame, his face working soundlessly; and
then his hands released their clenched grasp on the Slytherin boy's
lapels, and he walked away without anyone saying a word. (Well,
Lavender almost said a word - her mouth was just opening in
indignation, maybe because she hadn't gotten a chance to declaim
her speech - but luckily Hermione spotted it and made the gesture
that meant SHUT UP.)</em></p>
<p>Then there was sleeping, of course. You wouldn't want to forget
about sleeping just because it seemed so normal.</p>
<p><em>"Innervate!" said the young voice of Susan Bones, and
Hermione's eyes flew open and her lips drew in air with a gasp, her
lungs feeling heavy like there was a huge weight resting on her
chest. Beside her, Hannah was already sitting up, holding her head
in her hands and grimacing. Daphne had warned them that this would
be a 'hard' fight, creating a certain trepidation in Hermione, and
indeed in all of them. Except maybe Susan, who'd just shown up at
the appointed meeting-time, and walked alongside them without
speaking, and fought the seventh-year bully until she was the last
girl standing. Maybe the Gryffindor had been reluctant to fight the
last daughter of Bones, or maybe Susan had just gotten very lucky;
at any rate, when Hermione had tried to sit up again, she'd
realized that her chest had felt heavy because there was, in fact,
a rather large body sprawled on top of her.</em></p>
<p>And you wouldn't want to forget about magic either, even if the
actual moment of casting a spell only formed a very small part of
your day. It was the whole point of Hogwarts, after all.</p>
<p><em>"Okay, how about if we all ride around on skateboards?" said
Lavender. "We could get places faster than walking. And we'd look
really awesome on skateboards, Muggle artifacts may not be as fast
as broomsticks but they look cooler - we should vote on it
-"</em></p>
<p>As for the remaining fractions of time, you would fill that
according to your nature: gossip about upper-year romances, or
books and study sessions.</p>
<p><em>Hermione reached out a trembling hand to grasp her copy
of</em> Hogwarts: A History <em>from where it had fallen, the
ever-comforting book only a pace distant from where she herself had
ended up on the floor, after the red-robed upper-year girl had
"bumped" her into a wall. And then the older Gryffindor witch had
walked away without a look back, only a whispered "Salazar's -" and
a word that hurt her more than anything the Slytherins said about
mudbloods, 'mudblood' was just a strange wizarding word but
Hermione knew the word the Gryffindor had said. She couldn't get
used to it, she just couldn't get used to being hated. It still
hurt just as much every time it happened, and somehow it hurt even
more coming from the Gryffindors who were</em> supposed <em>to be
the good ones.</em></p>
<p>Harry had divided up eight of his soldiers among the other
armies, as ordered; he'd voluntarily given up <em>two</em> Chaotic
Lieutenants, sending Dean Thomas to Dragon Army and then trading
Seamus Finnigan to her for Blaise Zabini, who Harry had said was
being "underutilized" in Sunshine. Lavender had elected to join
most of SPHEW in Sunshine; Tracey had decided to stay with
Chaos.</p>
<p><em>"So you can work your charms on General Potter?" said
Lavender, as Hermione ignored both of them as hard as she could.
"I've got to say, Traces, I think our Sunshine General has him
pretty well sewn up by now - you'd have better luck convincing
Hermione that the three of you should have one of those, you know,
arrangements -"</em></p>
<p>Nobody had figured out yet what Draco Malfoy was plotting.</p>
<p><em>"Certain?" said Harry Potter, sounding rather reluctant.
"You know a rationalist isn't ever certain of anything, Hermione,
not even that two and two make four. I can't actually read Malfoy's
mind, and if I could, I couldn't be certain he wasn't a perfect
Occlumens. All I can say is that based on what I've seen of Malfoy,
it's a lot more plausible than Daphne Greengrass thinks, that he
actually is trying to show the Slytherins a better way. We
should... we really should try to go along with that,
Hermione."</em></p>
<p>(Well, Harry seemed to think Draco Malfoy was a good guy. But
then the trouble was that Harry also tended to trust people like
Professor Quirrell.)</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell," Harry said, "I'm worried about the hatred
Slytherin House seems to be developing for Hermione Granger."</p>
<p>They were sitting in the Defense Professor's office, Harry
sitting far back from the teacher's desk (and the sense of pending
disaster was still noticeable, even then), the empty bookcase still
framing Professor Quirrell's balding head. The cup balanced on
Harry's thigh was filled with Professor Quirrell's obscure,
probably-expensive Chinese tea, and it said something about the way
Harry had been thinking lately that he'd needed to make a conscious
decision to drink it.</p>
<p>"And this concerns me for what reason?" said Professor Quirrell,
sipping his tea.</p>
<p>"Yes, well," said Harry, "I'm just going to ignore that - oh,
stop that, Professor Quirrell, <em>you've</em> been plotting to
restore Slytherin House's reputation since at least the first
Friday of this year."</p>
<p>There might have been a tiny crack of a smile, at the edges of
those thin pale lips; and then again, there might not have been. "I
think Slytherin's House will do well enough in the end, Mr. Potter,
regardless of the fate of one girl. But I do agree that the present
outlook is not favorable for your little friend. The bullies of two
Houses, many of them with powerful and well-connected families, see
Miss Granger as a threat to their reputation and a shame to their
pride. As powerful a motive as that is to hurt her, it pales
compared to the raw envy of the Gryffindors, who see an outsider
gaining the laurels of heroism which they have dreamed of since
childhood." Now the smile on Professor Quirrell's lips was
definite, though slight. "And then there are those of Slytherin
House who hear that Salazar Slytherin's ghost has abandoned them to
favor a mudblood. I wonder if you can even conceive, Mr. Potter, of
how such as they would react? Those who do not believe it would
cheerfully kill Miss Granger for the insult. And as for those
Slytherins who wonder deep down, in some quiet place within
themselves, if it might perhaps be <em>true...</em> their inner
panic is something scarcely to be contemplated." Professor Quirrell
sipped his tea equably. "When you are more experienced, Mr. Potter,
you will see such consequences in advance of your plotting. As it
stands, you are being ill-served by your willful ignorance of all
human nature you deem unpleasant."</p>
<p>Harry sipped his own tea.</p>
<p>"Ah..." said Harry. "Professor Quirrell... help?"</p>
<p>"I already offered Miss Granger my help," said Professor
Quirrell, "as soon as I foresaw what would develop. My student told
me, in polite terms, to stay out of her business. Nor would she
tell you anything different, I expect. As I have little to truly
gain or lose in this matter, I hardly intend to press the point."
The Defense Professor shrugged, his teacup held steady in the
exactly-right polite grip, so that the surface of the liquid did
not even ripple as Professor Quirrell leaned back within his chair.
"Do not worry too much, Mr. Potter. Emotions run high around Miss
Granger, but she is in less danger than you might imagine. When you
are older, you will learn that the first and foremost thing which
any ordinary person does is nothing."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The envelope which the Slytherin System had delivered to Daphne
at lunch was unsigned, as always; the parchment within named a time
and a place and said, simply, <em>"Hard."</em></p>
<p>That wasn't what had concerned Daphne. What had concerned Daphne
was that Millicent didn't seem to be looking in her or Tracey's
direction at lunch that day. She'd just stared straight ahead at
her plate and eaten. Millicent had looked up just once that Daphne
saw, in the direction of the Hufflepuff table, and then looked
quickly back down again; though Daphne was too far away to see the
expression on Millicent's face, since Millicent had sat down far
away from her and Tracey.</p>
<p>Daphne had thought about that during lunch, with a sick feeling
in her stomach unlike anything she'd felt before, and which had
caused her to stop eating halfway through her first plate.</p>
<p><em>What I See has to come to pass... it probably makes being
eaten by Lethifolds look like a tea party...</em></p>
<p>It wasn't any conscious decision that Daphne made, nothing like
Slytherins were supposed to do, no weighing of the benefits to
herself.</p>
<p>Instead -</p>
<p>Daphne told Hannah and Susan and everyone, that her informant
had warned her that the next bully was going to target Hufflepuffs
in particular, and that the bully planned to risk the teachers'
wrath in order to <em>really</em> hurt either Hannah or Susan, like
<em>seriously</em>, and the two of them needed to stay out of this
one.</p>
<p>Hannah had agreed to stay out of it.</p>
<p>Susan had -</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"<em>What are you doing here?</em> " yelled General Granger,
though it was sort of a yell and a whisper at the same time.</p>
<p>Susan's round face didn't change, like the Hufflepuff girl had
suddenly developed the sort of experienced blankness that Daphne's
own Mother used. "Am I here, really?" Susan said calmly.</p>
<p>"<em>You said you wouldn't come!</em> "</p>
<p>"Did I say that?" said Susan. She flipped her wand casually in
one hand, leaning against the stone wall of the corridor where they
were waiting, her reddish-brown hair somehow arranging itself in
perfect order against the yellow trim of her witch's robes. "I
wonder why. Maybe I didn't want Hannah to get any strange ideas.
Hufflepuff loyalty, you know."</p>
<p>"If you don't leave," said the Sunshine General, "I'll call a
mission abort, and we'll <em>all</em> go back to our study halls,
Miss Bones!"</p>
<p>"<em>Hey!</em> " said Lavender. "We didn't vote on -"</p>
<p>"That's fine by me," said Susan, who was keeping a steady gaze
on the other end of the corridor where it merged into the tiled
hallway where they'd been told to expect the bully. "I'll just stay
here myself, then."</p>
<p>"Why -" said Daphne. Her heart was in her throat. <em>If I try
to change it, if</em> anyone <em>tries to change it, really
terrible, awful, no good, extremely bad things will happen. And
then it'll come to pass anyway...</em> "Why are you doing
this?"</p>
<p>"It's not like me," said Susan. "I know. But -" Susan shrugged.
"People don't always behave like themselves, you know."</p>
<p>They pleaded.</p>
<p>They begged.</p>
<p>Susan didn't even say anything anymore, she just kept watching,
waiting.</p>
<p>Daphne was nearly crying, she kept wondering if she'd
<em>caused</em> this, if trying to change Fate was making this
happen <em>worse</em> -</p>
<p>"Daphne," said Hermione, her voice sounding much higher than
usual, "go get a teacher. Run."</p>
<p>Daphne spun on her heels and started to pelt down the other
direction of the stony corridor, and then she realized, and she
turned back to where all the other girls except Susan were watching
her go, and Daphne, feeling like she was about to throw up, said,
"I can't..."</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " said Hermione.</p>
<p>"I think it gets worse every time you try to fight it," said
Daphne. That was how it worked in plays, sometimes.</p>
<p>Hermione stared at her, and then Hermione said, "Padma."</p>
<p>The other Ravenclaw girl just tore right out of there without
arguing. Daphne watched her go, knowing that Padma wasn't as good a
runner as her, and now wondering if maybe that would turn out to be
the <em>only reason</em> why help would come too late...</p>
<p>"Bullies are here," Susan said laconically. "Huh, they've got a
hostage."</p>
<p>They all whirled, and looked, and saw -</p>
<p><em>Three</em> older bullies, Daphne's eyes recognized Reese
Belka who was a top lieutenant in one of the seventh-year armies,
and Randolph Lee who was number two in the Hogwarts dueling club,
and worst of all, Robert Jugson III, in his sixth year, whose
father was almost certainly a Death Eater.</p>
<p>All three were surrounded by Shielding Charms, blue hazes that
glowed beneath the surface in ribbons of other color and showed
occasional faceting above, multi-layered shields like the three of
them thought they were fighting serious duelists and had expended
energy accordingly.</p>
<p>And behind them, bound and supported by glowing ropes, was
Hannah Abbott. Her eyes were wide and panicked and her mouth was
moving, though they couldn't hear anything through the
<em>Quietus</em> they'd put up earlier.</p>
<p>Then Jugson made an offhand gesture with his wand, and the
glowing ropes flung Hannah at them, there was a small pop as
Hannah's body blew through the Quieting barrier, Susan's wand was
instantly pointing at Hannah and Susan's voice muttered
"<em>Wingardium Leviosa</em>" -</p>
<p>"<em>Run!</em> " screamed Hannah, as she was gently lowered to
the ground.</p>
<p>But the corridor behind them and in front of them was now
blocked with a glowing gray field, a barrier spell that Daphne
didn't recognize.</p>
<p>"Do I need to explain what this is about?" Lee said with false
joviality. The seventh-year duelist was sporting a smile that
didn't reach his eyes. "Well, just in case, you little
inconveniences, and that includes you Miss Greengrass, you've been
quite enough trouble and you've told quite enough lies. We brought
your little friend just to make sure everyone knew we got all of
you - though I suppose the other Ravenclaw girl is hiding around a
corner or clinging to the ceiling somewhere? Well, no matter. This
is your -"</p>
<p>"Enough talk," said Robert Jugson III, "time for pain," and
raised his wand. "<em>Cluthe!</em> "</p>
<p>Simultaneously Susan pointed her wand and said
"<em>Prismatis!</em> " and a small rainbow sphere formed in midair
almost instantly, the miniature barrier so condensed and bright
that it stayed intact even as Jugson's hex hit it and bounced off
toward Belka, whose wand flashed to swat away the dark bolt; and
then a moment later the many-colored blaze was gone.</p>
<p>Daphne's eyes went wide for a moment; she'd never thought of
using a Prismatic Sphere like <em>that</em> -</p>
<p>"Jugsy, honey?" said Belka. Her lips widened in a vicious smile.
"I thought we discussed this. First we beat them, <em>then</em> we
play."</p>
<p>"P-please," said Hermione Granger in a faltering voice, "let
them go - I, I, I promise I'll -"</p>
<p>"Oh, really," said Lee in an annoyed tone. "Are you about to
offer to turn yourself over if we let the others go? We've got
<em>all</em> of you, now."</p>
<p>Jugson smiled, then. "It could be funny," said the sixth-year
junior Death Eater, softly and with menace. "How about if you lick
my shoes, mudblood, and <em>one</em> of your friends can go? Pick
whichever one you like best, leave the others to get hurt."</p>
<p>"Nope," said the young voice of Susan Bones, "not going to
happen," and with a blindingly fast motion the Hufflepuff girl
leapt leftward just as a red stunbolt erupted from Belka's wand,
Daphne could hardly <em>see</em> the movement as Susan seemed to
hit the corridor wall and then bounce off it like she was a rubber
ball and her legs smashed into Jugson's <em>face</em>, it didn't go
through the shield but the sixth-year went sprawling backward with
the impact and Susan followed him downward and her foot stamped
down on the boy's wand arm, again being repelled by the shield,
"<em>Elmekia!</em> " shouted Lee and Parvati shouted
"<em>Prismatis!</em> " and the rainbow wall formed but the fiery
blue blast passed right through it like it wasn't even there, the
bolt missed Susan by inches, there was a whirlwind of motion that
Daphne couldn't follow during which Belka had her feet knocked out
from under her, but the older witch just rolled back to a stand and
then -</p>
<p>Daphne saw it coming, and her lips started to mouth
"<em>Pris-</em>" but it was already too late.</p>
<p>Three blasts of brilliance slammed into Susan at once, she had
her wand raised as though she could counter them and there was a
white flash as the hexes struck the magical wood, but then Susan's
legs convulsed and sent her flying into a corridor wall. Her head
hit with a strange cracking sound, and then Susan fell down and lay
motionless with her head at an odd-seeming angle, her wand still
clutched in one outstretched hand.</p>
<p>There was a moment of frozen silence.</p>
<p>Parvati scrambled over to where Susan lay, pressed a thumb over
the pulse point on Susan's wrist, and then - then slowly,
tremblingly, Parvati rose to her feet, her eyes huge -</p>
<p>"<em>Vitalis revelio</em>," said Lee just as Parvati opened her
mouth, and Susan's body was surrounded by a warm red glow. Now the
seventh-year boy really was grinning. "Probably just a broken
collarbone, I'd say. Nice try, though."</p>
<p>"Merlin, they <em>are</em> tricky," said Jugson.</p>
<p>"You had me going for a second there, dearies." The seventh-year
girl wasn't smiling at all.</p>
<p>"<em>Tonare!</em> " screamed Daphne, raising her wand above her
head and focusing harder than she ever had in her life. "<em>Rava
calvaria! Lucis -</em>"</p>
<p>She didn't even see the hex that got her.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Hermione felt the jolt of Innervation bringing her awake, and
out of some intuitive strategism she <em>didn't</em> roll to her
feet right away; it had been a completely hopeless battle and she
didn't know what she could do but some instinct told her that
leaping to her feet wasn't it.</p>
<p>Just a crack, Hermione opened her eyes, and the thin rays of
light that entered them showed Parvati backing away from all three
bullies, the last girl standing that Hermione could see.</p>
<p>And her eyes also showed Tracey fallen not far away from her,
and Hermione's wand was still in her hand; and so, desperately
hoping the Slytherin girl would show more sense than she usually
did, Hermione made the wand movements as subtly as she could, and
hardly moving her lips, whispered, "Innervate."</p>
<p>Hermione felt the spell working, but Tracey didn't move.
Hermione hoped it was because Tracey was being cunning, and waiting
to...</p>
<p>What <em>could</em> they do?</p>
<p>Hermione didn't know, and the panic that had waited through the
moments of fighting was starting to eat her up inside now that she
was still, now that she was trying to think, now that she could see
that it was all absolutely hopeless.</p>
<p>That was when Hermione heard a thud, and though it was out of
her field of vision now, she knew that Parvati had fallen.</p>
<p>A moment of silence came, and passed.</p>
<p>"Now what?" said the voice of the scary-soft boy.</p>
<p>"Now we wake up the mudblood," said the precise voice of the
scary-formal boy, "and find out who's <em>really</em> behind them,
not Salazar Slytherin's ghost."</p>
<p>"No, dears," said the voice of the scary-sweet girl,
"<em>first</em> we bind them all <em>very</em> securely -"</p>
<p>And then there was a sound like lightning and thunder and
Hermione's eyes widened in shock before she could stop herself, and
in her widened field of vision she saw the scary-soft boy
convulsing as yellow arcs of energy crawled over him like giant
blazing worms. His wand flew out of his hand as he collapsed to the
ground, twitching, and then a moment later he lay still.</p>
<p>"Is everyone else asleep now?" said a voice. "Good."</p>
<p>Susan Bones rose from the floor near where the scary-soft boy
had stood, neck still oddly bent. Then she rolled her head around
her shoulders, a casual loose motion, and her head was straight
again.</p>
<p>The round-faced first-year girl stood facing the remaining two
bullies with one hand cocked on her hip.</p>
<p>Grinning.</p>
<p>And surrounded by faceted blue haze.</p>
<p>"Polyjuice!" spat the bully-girl.</p>
<p>"<em>Polyfluis Reverso!</em> " roared the remaining boy
bully.</p>
<p>Something like the form of a mirrored scarf spat out of his wand
-</p>
<p>Passed without resistance through the haze surrounding Susan
-</p>
<p>For an instant, she glowed in a strange mirror-color, like a
reflection of herself -</p>
<p>And then the glow faded.</p>
<p>The young girl still stood there, hand on her hip.</p>
<p>"Wrong," said Susan.</p>
<p>"And <em>this</em> is the truth," said Susan. "In case nobody
ever told you -"</p>
<p>In her small hand a wand rose up, blurred by the blue haze
surrounding it.</p>
<p>"You don't mess with the 'Puffs," said Susan, and with a grey
flash so bright it hurt Hermione's half-closed eyes, the real
battle started.</p>
<p>It went on for a while.</p>
<p>Some of the ceiling got melted.</p>
<p>The girl-bully tried to cry a truce, that they would leave and
take Jugson with them, and Susan roared out the syllables of a
curse Hermione recognized as Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting which was
illegal in seven countries.</p>
<p>Eventually the girl-bully lay unconscious and unawakenable on
the ground, and the last boy-bully had fled leaving his companions'
bodies behind, and Susan was leaned over against one wall, covered
in sweat and her scorched robes soaked through with wet spots,
gasping for breath, and clutching at her right shoulder using her
left hand.</p>
<p>After a while Susan straightened up, and turned to look back at
where her fellow witches were sleeping on the floor.</p>
<p>Well, they <em>should've</em> been sleeping on the floor.</p>
<p>Lavender was already sitting up with eyes as wide as
watermelons.</p>
<p>"That..." said Lavender.</p>
<p>"Was..." said Tracey.</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " said Hermione.</p>
<p>"I mean, <em>what?</em> " said Parvati.</p>
<p>"<em>Cool!</em> " said Lavender.</p>
<p>"Oh, hell," said Susan Bones. Her face had already looked a
little pale beneath the sweat, and now it was getting paler,
looking almost frighteningly white. "Ah... could I convince you
that you hallucinated all that?"</p>
<p>There was a rapid exchange of glances. Hermione looked at
Parvati, Parvati looked at Lavender, Lavender briefly locked gazes
with Tracey.</p>
<p>The four of them looked back at Susan and shook their heads.</p>
<p>"Oh, hell," said Susan again. "Look I'll be back in a few
minutes but I've really got to go now <em>please</em> don't say
anything bye!"</p>
<p>And Susan ran out into the hallway, moving surprisingly fast,
before anyone could say another word.</p>
<p>"No, seriously, <em>what?</em> " said Parvati.</p>
<p>"<em>Innervate</em>," said Hermione, pointing her wand at
Daphne, whose body she hadn't been able to see before; and Lavender
pointed her wand at Hannah's body and said the same.</p>
<p>Hannah's eyes opened and she tried frantically to roll to her
feet, but collapsed to the ground halfway through.</p>
<p>"It's okay, Hannah!" said Lavender. "We won."</p>
<p>"We <em>what?</em> " said Hannah from her little heap on the
floor.</p>
<p>Daphne hadn't stirred, but Hermione could see her chest rising
and falling, and the breathing rhythm looked normal enough. "I
think she's okay," said Hermione, "but -" She took a moment to
swallow, her mouth was still dry. This had all gotten way, way,
<em>way</em> out of hand. "I think we ought to take Daphne to Madam
Pomfrey's..."</p>
<p>"Sure, sure, just <em>give me a second here</em> and I'll
<em>probably be fine</em>," said Parvati.</p>
<p>"Ex<em>cuse</em> me," Hannah said in a tone that was polite, but
firm. "How did we win? And why does the ceiling look all
melty?"</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>"Susan did it," said Tracey.</p>
<p>"Yeah," said Parvati, voice only slightly shaky as she stood up
and started to brush off her red-trimmed robes, "it turns out that
Susan Bones is the Heir of Hufflepuff and she's opened up the
long-lost entrance to Helga Hufflepuff's Chamber of Hard Work and
Practice."</p>
<p>"<em>Huh?</em> " said Hannah, who was feeling over herself as if
to make sure all her body parts were still there. "I thought that
was just something Professor Sprout says to teach us an Important
Moral Lesson - <em>Susan</em> is?"</p>
<p>Slowly, Hermione was beginning to feel a bit more together. It
hadn't really been more than thirty seconds of extreme terror, at
least not the parts she'd been conscious for. "Actually," Hermione
said carefully, as her mind started to work again, "I'm pretty sure
that <em>is</em> just something Professor Sprout says, it wasn't in
<em>Hogwarts: A History</em> or anywhere else I've read -"</p>
<p>"<em>She's a double witch!</em> " shouted Tracey, her voice so
high it cracked. "She <em>is!</em> She's one of <em>them!</em>
She's been this whole time!"</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " yelled Parvati, twisting around to look at
Tracey. "That is the <em>looniest</em> thing -"</p>
<p>"Of <em>course!</em> " said Lavender, now all the way on her
feet and starting to bounce up and down with excitement. "I
should've <em>realized!</em> "</p>
<p>"Susan's a <em>what?</em> " said Hermione.</p>
<p>"A <em>double</em> witch!" said Tracey.</p>
<p>"You see," said Lavender, speaking very rapidly, "There've
always been stories, about these children who are born as super
magicians who can cast spells no one else can, and there's a whole
secret school hidden inside Hogwarts with classes that only they
can see and go to -"</p>
<p>"Those are just <em>stories!</em> " yelled Parvati. "That's not
how real life works! I mean, sure, I read those books too -"</p>
<p>"Just a minute, please," said Hermione. Maybe her mind
<em>was</em> feeling a little slow after all. "You mean even though
you <em>already</em> get to go to a magical school and everything,
you still want to go to a <em>double</em> magical school?"</p>
<p>Lavender looked at her, puzzled. "What?" said Lavender. "Who
<em>wouldn't</em> want to have super extra magical powers? It would
be like this whole amazing <em>destiny</em> and everything! It'd
mean you were <em>special!</em> "</p>
<p>Hannah nodded to that, looking up from where she'd crawled to
Daphne's side and was checking the girl for broken bones. "I wish
<em>I</em> was a double witch," Hannah said, and then, sounding a
little sadder, "though I don't believe there is any such thing,
really... what did you see Susan do, exactly? I mean, are you sure
you weren't just seeing things after getting stunned?"</p>
<p>Hermione truly, truly couldn't find any words at this point.</p>
<p>"Oh, no," said Tracey. The Slytherin girl spun around to look at
the entrance to the corridor, her robes fluttering around her. "Oh
no! We've got to get out of here! We've got to get away before
Susan comes back with someone who can Super-Memory-Charm us!"</p>
<p>"Susan wouldn't <em>do</em> that!" said Parvati. "I mean, if
there even <em>was</em> -"</p>
<p>"WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?" roared a high-pitched squeaky voice, as
Professor Flitwick stormed into the partially melted corridor like
a small, dangerously compressed package of pure academic fury, an
ashen-faced Padma gasping along behind him.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"What <em>happened?</em> " Susan blurted to the girl who looked
exactly like her, except for the scorched robes damp with
sweat.</p>
<p>"Ooh, great question!" said the other Susan Bones as she rapidly
skinned off what was left of her borrowed clothes. A moment later
the girl began to Metamorphose back into her more accustomed form
of Nymphadora Tonks. "Sorry but I couldn't think of anything myself
so you've got about three minutes to decide on an answer to that
-"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>As Daphne Greengrass observed afterward with some acidity, the
flaw in Hermione's cunning plan to make sure that House points were
taken evenly from all four Houses if they got caught, was that it
didn't work on <em>detentions</em>.</p>
<p>They'd all agreed to keep their mouths shut about Susan's
mysterious powers - even Tracey, after Susan threatened to have her
Super-Memory-Charmed if she didn't promise. Unfortunately, they
discovered at dinnertime that someone had forgotten to tell the
<em>bullies</em> about their agreement, and also that Susan Bones
had sacrificed her soul to dreadful forbidden powers which now
inhabited the hulk of her body and that was why they'd all gotten
detention.</p>
<p>"Hermione?" Harry Potter said to her from beside her at the
dinner table, his voice very tentative. "Please don't take offense,
and I'll understand if you say it's none of my business, but I
think all this is starting to spin out of control."</p>
<p>Hermione went on mashing the slice of chocolate cake on her
plate into a seamless mush of cake and icing. "Yes," Hermione said,
her voice might have been a little acerbic, "that was what I said
to Professor Flitwick while I was apologizing to him, that I knew
things had gotten out of hand, and he yelled: <em>Really, Miss
Granger? Do you think?</em> in a squeak so loud that my ears caught
on fire. I mean my ears <em>actually caught on fire</em>. Professor
Flitwick had to put them out again."</p>
<p>Harry had put his hand to his forehead. "Excuse me," Harry said.
His face was perfectly straight. "Sometimes I still have a little
trouble getting used to that sort of thing. Hey, Hermione, remember
when we were young and naive and we still thought the world was a
relatively understandable place?"</p>
<p>Hermione put her fork down and looked at him for a moment. "Do
you sometimes wish you were a Muggle, Harry?"</p>
<p>"<em>Huh?</em> " said Harry. "Well, of course not! I mean, even
if I was a Muggle, I'd probably have tried someday to take over the
worrrrlllll-" as Hermione gave him a <em>look</em> and the boy
hastily swallowed the word and said, "I mean <em>optimize</em> of
course, you <em>know</em> that's what I really mean, Hermione! My
point is, it's not like my <em>goals</em> would change one way or
another. But with magic it's going to be a lot easier to get things
done than if I had to do stuff using only the Muggle capability
set. If you think about it logically, that's <em>why</em> I'm going
to Hogwarts instead of just ignoring all this and studying for a
career in nanotechnology."</p>
<p>Hermione, having finished hand-crafting her Chocolate Cake
Sauce, began to dip her carrots in it and eat them.</p>
<p>"Why do you ask?" said Harry. "Do <em>you</em> wish you were
back in the Muggle world?"</p>
<p>"Not exactly," Hermione said, as she crunched into both the
carrot and the chocolate. "I was just, well, feeling strange about
having <em>wanted</em> to be a witch... Did you want to be a wizard
when you were little?"</p>
<p>"Of course," Harry said promptly. "I also wanted psychic powers
and super-strength and adamantium-reinforced bones and my own
flying castle and sometimes I felt sad that I might have to settle
for just being a famous scientist and an astronaut."</p>
<p>Hermione nodded. "You know," she said softly, "I think the
witches and wizards who <em>grow up</em> here don't really
appreciate magic properly..."</p>
<p>"Well, of course they don't," Harry said, "that's what gives us
our advantage. Isn't that obvious? I mean seriously, that was
bloody obvious to me within five minutes of walking into Diagon
Alley." There was a puzzled look on the boy's face, like he
couldn't understand why she was paying attention to something so
ordinary.</p>

<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 74: SA, Escalation of Conflicts, Pt
9<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>Harry walked forward a step, then another step, until a sense of
unease began to pervade him, a disquiet in his nerves.</p>
<p>He said nothing, lifted no hand; the pervading sense of unease
would say it for him.</p>
<p>From behind the closed door of the office came a whisper,
carrying through the door as though no door were present.</p>
<p>"It is not my office hours," said that cold whisper, "nor yet
the time of our meeting. I take ten Quirrell points from you, and
be glad it is not more."</p>
<p>Harry stayed calm. Going through Azkaban had recalibrated his
scale of emotional disturbances; and losing a House point, which
had formerly rated five out of ten, now lay somewhere around zero
point three. Harry's voice was likewise level, as he said, "You
made a testable prediction and it was falsified, Professor. I only
wished to note that."</p>
<p>As Harry turned to go, he heard the door opening behind him, and
he swung back around in some surprise.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was leaning back in his chair, his head
lolling back against its rest, as a parchment floated before him.
Both the Defense Professor's hands rested limply on the desk, as
though nerveless. He might have been a corpse, excepting that the
ice-blue eyes still moved, back and forth, back and forth.</p>
<p>The parchment vanished, and was replaced by another so quickly
it was like the material had only flickered.</p>
<p>Then the lips moved as well. "And from this," whispered the
lips, "you infer what, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>Harry was shaken by the sight, but his voice stayed even as he
said, "That ordinary people do not always do nothing, and that
Hermione Granger is in more danger from Slytherin House than you
thought."</p>
<p>The lips curved, ever so barely. "So you think I have failed in
my grasp of human nature. But that is hardly the only possibility,
boy. Do you see the other?"</p>
<p>Harry furrowed his brows as he stared at the Defense
Professor.</p>
<p>"I tire of this," the Defense Professor whispered. "You will
stand there until you see it for yourself, or else leave." As
though Harry had stopped existing, the Defense Professor's eyes
looked back to the parchment, once more scanning back and
forth.</p>
<p>It was six parchments later that Harry saw it, and said out
loud, "You think your prediction failed because there was some
other factor at work which was not in your model. Some reason why
Slytherin House hates Hermione more than you realized. Like when
the orbital calculations for Uranus were wrong, and the problem
wasn't in Newton's Laws, it was that they didn't know about Neptune
-"</p>
<p>The parchment vanished, and was not replaced. The head rose from
its lolling position then, facing Harry more directly, and the
voice which issued forth was quiet, but not toneless. "I think,
boy," Professor Quirrell said softly, but in something approaching
his normal voice, "that if all Slytherin House hated her so much, I
would have seen it. And yet three formidable fighters of that House
did something rather than nothing, at risk and at cost to
themselves. What force could have moved them, or willed their
motion?" The icy blue glitter of the Defense Professor's eyes met
Harry's own gaze. "Some hand possessed of influence within
Slytherin, perhaps. Then how would that hand have benefited itself
by harm done to the girl and her followers?"</p>
<p>"Um..." said Harry. "It would have to be someone threatened by
Hermione somehow, or someone who would get the credit if she was
hurt? I don't know anyone who fits that profile, but then I don't
know much about anyone in Slytherin outside first-year." The
thought was also coming to Harry that deducing a hidden mastermind
from a single mildly-unexpected attack seemed like insufficient
evidence to support the prior improbability of the theory; but then
it <em>was</em> Professor Quirrell who was doing the
deducing...</p>
<p>The Defense Professor was just looking at Harry, eyelids
slightly lowered as though in impatience.</p>
<p>"And yes," said Harry, "I <em>am</em> sure that Draco Malfoy
isn't behind it."</p>
<p>A hiss of outward air like a sigh. "He is the son of Lucius
Malfoy, trained to the most exacting standards. Whatever you have
seen of him, even in what seem to be unguarded moments when his
mask slips and you trust that you have seen the truth beneath, even
that may all be part of the face he chooses to show you."</p>
<p><em>Only if Draco successfully cast the Patronus Charm as part
of keeping up the act.</em> But Harry didn't say that, of course;
instead he just grinned slightly, and said, "So either you've
<em>really</em> never read Draco's mind, or that's just what you
want me to think."</p>
<p>There was a pause. One of the hands turned over, beckoned a
finger.</p>
<p>Harry stepped into the room. The door closed behind him.</p>
<p>"That was not something you should have said aloud in human
speech," said Professor Quirrell's soft voice. "Legilimency, on
Malfoy's heir? Did Lucius Malfoy learn of it, he would have me
assassinated outright."</p>
<p>"He would <em>try</em>," Harry said. It should have won a
crinkle of Professor Quirrell's eyes, but the Defense Professor's
face was unmoving. "But sorry."</p>
<p>When the Defense Professor spoke again, his voice had once more
become a cold whisper. "I suppose I could, and pity the assassin."
His head fell back against the chair, lolled to one side, the eyes
no longer meeting Harry's. "But these small games hardly hold my
interest as they stand. Add Legilimency, and it ceases to be a game
at all."</p>
<p>Harry hardly knew what to say. He'd seen Professor Quirrell in
an angry mood once or twice before, but this seemed emptier, and
Harry didn't know what to say to it. <em>What's bothering you,
Professor Quirrell?</em> he could not ask<em>.</em></p>
<p>"What <em>does</em> hold your interest?" Harry said a few
moments later, after he'd worked it out as a safer-seeming strategy
for redirecting Professor Quirrell's attention to positive things.
Citing experimental results about keeping a gratitude journal as a
strategy for improving life happiness didn't seem like it would be
taken well.</p>
<p>"I will tell you what does not hold my interest," said that icy
whisper. "Grading Ministry-mandated essays does not hold my
interest, Mr. Potter. But I have undertaken the position of Defense
Professor at Hogwarts, and I will see it through to its end."
Another parchment appeared in front of Professor Quirrell's head,
and his eyes began to scan it. "Reese Belka held a high position in
my armies before her folly. I will offer her the chance to stay
rather than being expelled, if she tells me exactly of the forces
which moved her. And I shall make clear to her what will happen if
she lies. I do permit myself to read faces."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor's finger pointed past Harry, toward the
door.</p>
<p>"But whether you were wrong about human nature," Harry said, "or
whether there's some extra force at work in Slytherin House -
either way, Hermione Granger is in more danger than you predicted.
Last time it was three strong fighters, so what happens after
-"</p>
<p>"She wishes not my help, nor yours," said a soft cold voice. "I
no longer find your concerns so entertaining as I once did, Mr.
Potter. Go."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Somehow, even though they were all equals and she definitely
wasn't in charge, it was always Hermione who ended up speaking
first in this sort of situation.</p>
<p>The four tables of Hogwarts, the four Houses having breakfast,
were glancing over at where they, the eight members of S.P.H.E.W.,
had gathered off to one side.</p>
<p>Professor Flitwick was also staring sternly at all of them from
the Head Table. Hermione wasn't looking there, but she could feel
Professor Flitwick's gaze on the back of her neck.
<em>Literally</em> feel it. It was really creepy.</p>
<p>"Why'd you tell Tracey you wanted to talk to us, Mr. Potter?"
said Hermione, her tone crisp.</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell expelled Reese Belka from her army last
night," Harry Potter said. "And from all her other after-school
Defense activities. Do any of you see the significance of that?
Miss Greengrass? Padma?"</p>
<p>Harry's eyes swept over them, as Hermione exchanged a puzzled
glance with Padma, and Daphne shook her head.</p>
<p>"Well," Harry said quietly, "I wouldn't actually expect you to.
But what it means is that you're in danger, and I don't know how
much danger." The boy squared his shoulders, looking straight into
Hermione's eyes. "I wasn't going to say this, but... I just wanted
to offer to put you under whatever protection I could give. Make it
clear to everyone that anyone who messes with you, is messing with
the Boy-Who-Lived."</p>
<p>"Harry!" said Hermione sharply. "You <em>know</em> I don't want
-"</p>
<p>"Some of them are <em>my</em> friends too, Hermione." Harry
didn't take his eyes from hers. "And it's their decision, not
yours. Padma? You told me that I owed you no debt for what I did,
and that's the sort of thing a friend would say."</p>
<p>Hermione broke her gaze from Harry, to look at where Padma was
shaking her head.</p>
<p>"Lavender?" Harry said. "You fought well in my army, and I'll
fight for you if you wish it."</p>
<p>"Thank <em>you</em>, General!" Lavender said crisply. "I mean
Mr. Potter. No, though. I'm a heroine and a Gryffindor, and I can
fight for myself."</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>"Parvati?" Harry said. "Susan? Hannah? Daphne? I don't know any
of you so well, but it's something I would offer anyone who came to
ask it of me, I think."</p>
<p>One by one, the other four girls shook their heads.</p>
<p>Hermione realized what was coming, then, but she didn't see a
single thing she could do about it.</p>
<p>"And my loyal soldier, Chaotic Tracey?" said Harry Potter.</p>
<p>"<em>Really?</em> " gasped Tracey, oblivious to the stabbing
glares that Hermione and every other girl were directing at her.
Tracey's hands flew artfully to her cheeks, though she didn't
actually manage to blush, not that Hermione could see; and her
brown eyes were, if not shining, at least opened very wide. "You'd
do that? For <em>me?</em> I mean - I mean, of course, absolutely,
General Chaos -"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>And so it was on that very morning that Harry Potter went over
to the Gryffindor table, and then the Slytherin table, and told
both Houses that anyone who hurt Tracey Davis, regardless of what
she was doing at the time, would, quote, learn the true meaning of
Chaos, unquote.</p>
<p>It was with considerable restraint that Draco Malfoy managed to
prevent himself from slamming his head repeatedly into his plate of
toast.</p>
<p>They weren't exactly scientists, the bullies of Hogwarts.</p>
<p>But even <em>they</em>, Draco knew, were going to want to test
it.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The Society for the Promotion of Heroic Equality for Witches
hadn't <em>announced</em> it, it didn't seem like it would do any
good to <em>announce</em> it. But they had all quietly decided (or,
in the case of Lavender, been shouted into it by all seven other
girls) to take a break from fighting bullies for a while, at least
until their Heads of House weren't looking at them quite so sharply
anymore, and older students had stopped bumping Hermione into
walls.</p>
<p>Daphne had <em>told</em> Millicent that they were taking a
break.</p>
<p>And so it was with some puzzlement, a few days later, that
Daphne looked at the parchment delivered to her at lunch, drawn in
a hand so shaky it was almost unreadable, saying:</p>
<p><em>2 this afternoon at the top of the stairs going up from the
library REALLY IMPORTANT everyone has to be there -
Millicent</em></p>
<p>Daphne looked around, but she couldn't see Millicent anywhere in
the Great Hall.</p>
<p>"A message from your informant?" said Hermione, when Daphne told
her. "That's odd - <em>I</em> didn't -"</p>
<p>"You didn't what?" said Daphne, after the Ravenclaw girl had
stopped in mid-sentence.</p>
<p>The Sunshine General shook her head and said, "Listen, Daphne, I
think we need to know where these messages come from before we keep
following them. Look at what happened last time, how could anyone
have <em>known</em> where those three bullies would be, unless they
were in on it?"</p>
<p>"I can't say -" Daphne said. "I mean, I can't say anything, but
I know where the messages come from, and I know how anyone can
know."</p>
<p>Hermione gave Daphne a <em>look</em> that, for a moment, made
the Ravenclaw girl look scarily like Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>"Uh huh," said Hermione. "And do you know how Susan suddenly
turned into Supergirl?"</p>
<p>Daphne shook her head, and said, "No, but I think it might be
<em>really important</em> that if we get a message saying we should
be somewhere, <em>everyone has to be there</em>." Daphne hadn't
<em>seen</em> what had happened with Susan, after Daphne had tried
to avert the prophecy by keeping Susan away. But she'd been
<em>told</em> about it afterward, and now Daphne was afraid
that...</p>
<p>She might have possibly...</p>
<p>Might possibly have Broken Something...</p>
<p>"Uh huh," said Hermione, who was doing the McGonagall Stare
again.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Nobody seemed to know where it had started, who had started it.
If you'd tried tracing it afterward, tracked it back word by word
and mutter by mutter, you probably would have found it all going in
a huge circle.</p>
<p>Peregrine Derrick was tapped on his shoulder as he left Potions
that morning.</p>
<p>Jaime Astorga heard a whisper in his ear at lunch.</p>
<p>Robert Jugson III discovered a tiny folded note under his
plate.</p>
<p>Carl Sloper overheard two older Gryffindors whispering about it,
and they gave him significant glances as they walked past.</p>
<p>Nobody seemed to know where the word began, or who had first
spoken it, but it named the place, and it named the time, and it
said that the color would be white.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"Every single one of you had better be absolutely clear on
this," said Susan Bones. The Hufflepuff girl, or whatever strange
power had possessed her, wasn't even <em>pretending</em> to act
normal anymore. The round-faced girl was striding through the halls
with a firm, confident gait. "If we get there and it's just one
bully, that's fine, you can fight them the regular way. My
mysterious superpowers won't activate if there are no innocents in
danger. But if five seventh-year bullies jump out of a closet, you
know what you do? That's right, you <em>run away</em> and let me
fight them. Finding a teacher is optional, the important thing is
that you <em>run away</em> as soon as I create an opening. In a
fight like that you are <em>liabilities</em>. You are <em>civilian
targets</em> I have to worry about protecting. So you will get away
as fast as possible and you <em>will not try</em> to do
<em>anything</em> heroic or so help me, the hour you get out of
your healer's beds I will <em>personally</em> show up and <em>kick
your asses</em> right back in. Are we all clear on that?"</p>
<p>"Yes," squeaked most of the girls, though in Hannah's case it
came out, "Yes, Lady Susan!"</p>
<p>"<em>Don't</em> call me that," snapped Susan. "And <em>I don't
think I heard you, Miss Brown!</em> I'm warning you, I have friends
who write plays and if you do anything dumb, posterity will
remember you as Lavender, the Amazing Stupid Hostage."</p>
<p>(Hermione was beginning to worry about just how many other
Hogwarts students besides Harry had mysterious dark sides, and
whether <em>she</em> was likely to develop one if she kept hanging
out with them.)</p>
<p>"Alright, Captain Bones," said Lavender in an unusually
respectful tone, as they turned another corner along the shortest
way to the library, passing through a rather large corridor studded
with six sets of double doors, three sets on either side. "Can I
ask if there's any way for <em>me</em> to become a double
witch?"</p>
<p>"Sign up for the Auror preparation program in your sixth year,"
said Susan. "It's the next best thing. Oh, and if a famous Auror
offers to oversee your summer internship, just ignore anyone who
warns you that he's a terrible influence or that you're almost
certainly going to die."</p>
<p>Lavender was nodding rapidly. "Got it, got it."</p>
<p>(Padma, who hadn't actually been there last time, was giving
Susan <em>very</em> skeptical looks.)</p>
<p>Then Susan suddenly stopped in place and her wand snapped up and
she said, "<em>Protego Maximus!</em> "</p>
<p>A jolt of adrenaline went through Hermione, she was instantly
drawing her wand and spinning around -</p>
<p>But she couldn't see anything wrong, through the greater blue
haze now surrounding them all.</p>
<p>The other girls, who had likewise pulled into formation, were
also looking puzzled.</p>
<p>"Sorry!" said Susan. "Sorry, girls. Give me a moment to check
this place out. Thinking of a certain person has just reminded me
that this hall we're in right now, with all those doors, would be
an <em>excellent</em> place for an ambush."</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence.</p>
<p>"Now," said a harsh male voice, blurred into unidentifiability
by a buzzing undertone.</p>
<p>All six sets of double doors slammed open.</p>
<p>White robes filed silently forward, all-concealing white robes
without marks of House affiliation and white cloth hiding the faces
beneath the hoods. They marched out, and marched out, crowding the
great corridor in numbers too high to count easily. Less than fifty
robes, probably. Certainly more than thirty. All of them already
surrounded by blue haze.</p>
<p>Susan said some Extremely Bad Words, so awful that at almost any
other time, Hermione would have noticed.</p>
<p>"That message!" Daphne cried in sudden horror. "It
<em>wasn't</em> from -"</p>
<p>"Millicent Bulstrode?" said the voice and its buzzing undertone.
"No, it wasn't. You see, Miss Greengrass, if the same girl sends
off a Slytherin message every day you fight a bully, pretty soon
someone else will notice. We'll have a talk with her after we're
done with you."</p>
<p>"Miss Susan," said Hannah in a voice just starting to quaver,
"can you be super enough to -"</p>
<p>Wands rose in many hands. There came a series of blinding
flashes of green light, a massive volley of shieldbreakers, at the
end of which there was no more protective blue dome surrounding
them, and Susan had fallen to her knees, clutching her head.</p>
<p>Barriers of solid blackness had sprung into being at both ends
of the corridor. Behind the double doors that Hermione could see
into, there were only unused classrooms, very dead ends.</p>
<p>"No," said the male voice with that buzz overlaid, "she can't.
In case you haven't noticed, you've gotten quite a lot of people
very angry at you and we have no intention of losing this time. All
right everyone, prepare to fire."</p>
<p>The wands around the perimeter aimed again, low enough that
their enemies wouldn't hit each other if they missed.</p>
<p>And then another male voice, with a similar buzz accompanying
it, suddenly said "<em>Homenum Revelio!</em> "</p>
<p>An instant later there was another massive volley of
shieldbreakers and hexes, fired on reflex at the suddenly revealed
figure, shattering the shields which had almost immediately begun
to form around it -</p>
<p>And then, as that same figure fell to the ground, a stunned
silence.</p>
<p>"<em>Professor Snape?</em> " said the second voice.
"<em>He's</em> the one who's been interfering?"</p>
<p>It was the Potions Master of Hogwarts who now lay unconscious on
the stone floor, the dirt-spotted robes stirring for a final moment
before they settled in place, his fallen hand outstretched toward
where his wand was slowly rolling away.</p>
<p>"No," said the first male voice, now sounding a bit more
uncertain. Then it rallied, "No, that can't possibly be it. He
heard us passing the word, of course, and came along to make sure
nobody screwed it up again. We'll wake him up afterward and
apologize and he'll Memory-Charm the children so they don't
remember, he's a Professor so he can do that. Anyway, we should
make sure we're <em>really</em> alone now. <em>Veritas
Oculum!</em> "</p>
<p>Fully two dozen different Charms must have been spoken, then,
but no more invisible people showed up. One of them in particular
made Hermione's heart sink; she recognized it as the Charm which
had been listed alongside the description of the True Cloak of
Invisibility, which would not reveal the Cloak, but would tell you
whether it or certain other artifacts were nearby.</p>
<p>"Girls?" whispered Susan. She was slowly pushing herself to her
feet, though Hermione could see her limbs swaying and quivering.
"Girls, I'm sorry for what I said before. If you've got anything
clever and heroic to try, you might as well try it."</p>
<p>"Oh, yeah," Tracey Davis said then, her voice trembling. "I
almost <em>forgot</em>." The Slytherin girl raised her voice, and
spoke.</p>
<p>"Hey, all of you!" yelled Tracey in a high-pitched shaky shout.
"Hey, are you planning to hurt me too?"</p>
<p>"Yes, actually," said the buzzing voice of the leader. "We
are."</p>
<p>"I'm under Harry Potter's protection, you know! Anyone who tries
to hurt me will learn the true meaning of Chaos! So are you going
to let me go?" It should have sounded defiant. It came out sounding
terrified.</p>
<p>There was a pause. Some of the hoods of the robes turned to face
each other, then turned back to face the girls.</p>
<p>"Hm..." said the buzzing male voice. "Hm... no."</p>
<p>Tracey Davis put her wand away into her robes.</p>
<p>Slowly, deliberately, she raised her right hand high in the air,
and pressed her thumb and forefingers together.</p>
<p>"Go ahead," said that voice.</p>
<p>Tracey Davis snapped her fingers.</p>
<p>There was a long, awful pause.</p>
<p>Nothing happened.</p>
<p>"Yes, well," said the voice -</p>
<p>Tracey said, her voice sounding even higher and shakier,
"<em>Acathla, mundatus sum</em>." Her hand, stretching up still
further, snapped its fingers a second time.</p>
<p>A nameless chill went down Hermione's spine then, a frisson of
fear and disorientation like she'd just felt the floor tilt beneath
her, threatening to spill her into some darkness lying beneath.</p>
<p>"What's she -" began a buzzing female voice.</p>
<p>Tracey's face looked pale, twisted with fear, but her lips
moved, spilled forth sound in a high chant, "<em>Mabra, brahoring,
mabra...</em>"</p>
<p>A chill wind seemed to spring up within the confines of the
corridor, a dark breath that caressed their faces and touched their
hands with ice.</p>
<p>"Fire at her on my count!" shouted the leading voice. "One,
two<em>, three!</em> " and maybe-forty voices roared spells,
creating a huge concentric array of fiery bolts that lit the wide
corridor brighter than the Sun -</p>
<p>- for the short moment before the bolts struck and vanished upon
a dark red octagon that appeared in the air around the girls, and
then disappeared a moment later.</p>
<p>Hermione saw it, she saw it but she still couldn't imagine it;
she couldn't imagine a Shielding Charm that powerful, a spell that
would withstand an army.</p>
<p>And Tracey's voice went on chanting, her voice sounding louder
and more confident, and her face screwed up like she was trying to
remember something <em>very exactly</em>.</p>
<p><em>"Shuffle, duffle, muzzle, muff.<br>
Fista, wista, mista-cuff."</em></p>
<p>Now all those present could feel it, heroines and bullies alike,
the sensation of some dark will pressing down on them, a tingling
in the air as something built and built and built. All the blue
hazes around the white robes, all the shielding spells, had died
out without any visible hex touching them. There were more flashes
of light as more desperate spells were fired, but they fizzled out
in midair like candle-flames touching water.</p>
<p>The black barriers at the two ends of the corridor had
dissipated like smoke beneath the growing pressure, but their
evaporation revealed the exits sealed, blocked by tiled slats of
dark metal that looked stained as though with blood; and as Tracey
chanted "<em>Lemarchand, Lament, Lemarchand</em>," a dreadful blue
light began to shine out from beneath the metal slats and between
them; and the six sets of double doors slammed shut all at once, as
panicked white-robed bullies began to pound on them and howl.</p>
<p>Then Tracey's hand slashed to her left, and she cried
"<em>Khornath!</em> ", then her hand pointed below her and
"<em>Slaaneth!</em> ", above her "<em>Nurgolth!</em> ", and then,
to her right, "<em>TZINTCHI!</em> "</p>
<p>Tracey paused, took a deep breath; and Hermione found her voice
and cried, "<em>Stop! Tracey, stop!</em> "</p>
<p>But there was a strange wild smile on Tracey's face. She raised
her hand still higher, and snapped her fingers a third time; and
when she spoke again, beneath her high girlish voice there was an
undertone as though some lower chorus were chanting along with
her.</p>
<p><em>"Darkness beyond darkness, deeper than pitchest black.<br>
Buried beneath the flow of time...<br>
From darkness to darkness, your voice echoes in the
emptiness,<br>
Unknown to death, nor known to life."<br></em></p>
<p>"<em>What are you doing?</em> " shrieked Parvati, and the
Gryffindor girl stretched out a hand as though to pull down the
Slytherin, who was now starting to float upward into the air; and
both Daphne and Susan grabbed Parvati's arm at the same time and
Daphne cried out, "Don't, we don't know what will happen if the
ritual is interrupted!"</p>
<p>"<em>Well what happens if it gets COMPLETED?</em> " screamed
Hermione, as close as she'd ever come to total brain meltdown.</p>
<p>Susan's face was white as chalk, and she whispered, "I'm sorry,
Mad-Eye..."</p>
<p>And Tracey spoke on, her body floating higher and higher off the
floor, her black hair whipping wildly around her in the chill
winds.</p>
<p><em>"You who know the gate, who are the gate, the key and
guardian of the gate:<br>
I bid you open the way for him, and manifest his power before
me!"</em></p>
<p>The corridor was plunged then into utter darkness and silence,
so that only Tracey could be seen and heard, like there was nothing
left in the universe except her and the light illuminating her from
some nameless source.</p>
<p>The shining girl raised her hand one final time, and with
dreadful gravity, pressed her thumb and forefinger together.</p>
<p>And within the darkness Hermione looked at Tracey's face and saw
that the Slytherin girl's eyes were now, to the exact shade, the
green of Harry Potter's.</p>
<p><em>"Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres!<br>
Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres!<br>
HARRY JAMES POTTER-EVANS-VERRES!"</em></p>
<p>There was a snap like thunder, and then -</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry had chosen to assume a rather relaxed posture, as he sat
in a low chair before the mighty desk of the Headmaster of
Hogwarts: one leg cocked over his knee, and his arms sprawling
casually to either side. Harry was doing his best to disregard the
noise from the surrounding devices, although the one directly
behind him that sounded like an owl hooting desperately as it was
put through a woodchipper was pretty difficult to ignore.</p>
<p>"Harry," the old wizard said from behind the desk, the aged
voice level as the blue eyes stared out at him from beneath the
shining half-moon spectacles. Headmaster Dumbledore had garbed
himself in robes of midnight purple; not true formal black, but
dark enough to come close indeed to deadly seriousness, as the
wizarding world counted the meaning of fashions. "Were you...
<em>responsible</em> for this?"</p>
<p>"I cannot deny that my influence was at work," Harry said.</p>
<p>The old wizard took off his glasses, leaned forward to stare at
Harry directly, blue eyes to green. "I will ask you one question,"
the Headmaster said in a quiet voice. "Do you think that what you
did today was - <em>appropriate?</em> "</p>
<p>"They were bullies and they came to that hallway with the direct
intent of hurting Hermione Granger and seven other first-year
children," Harry said levelly. "If I am not too young for moral
judgment, then neither are they. No, Headmaster, they didn't
deserve to die. But they <em>did</em> deserve to be stripped naked
and glued to the ceiling."</p>
<p>The old wizard put his glasses back on. For the first time that
Harry had seen of him, the Headmaster seemed to be at a loss for
words. "As Merlin himself is my witness," said Dumbledore, "I
haven't the faintest notion of how I ought to react to this."</p>
<p>"That's pretty much the effect I was aiming for," said Harry. He
felt like he ought to be whistling a merry tune, but unfortunately
he had never learned how to whistle reliably.</p>
<p>"I need not ask you who is <em>directly</em> responsible," said
the Headmaster. "Only three wizards within Hogwarts might be
powerful enough. I myself did not do it. Severus has assured me he
was not involved. And the third..." The Headmaster shook his head
in some dismay. "You loaned the Defense Professor your Cloak,
Harry. I do not think that was wise. For now that he has escaped
detection by simple Charms, he surely knows that it is a Deathly
Hallow - if, indeed, he did not know from its first touch upon his
flesh."</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell had already deduced my possession of an
invisibility cloak," Harry said. "And knowing him, he has probably
guessed that it is a Deathly Hallow. But in <em>this</em> case,
Headmaster, it so happens that Professor Quirrell was under one of
those face-concealing white robes."</p>
<p>There was another pause.</p>
<p>"How very cunning," said the Headmaster. He leaned back in his
throne and sighed. "I have spoken to the Defense Professor. Just
before you, indeed. I did not quite know what to say. I told him
that this was not the approved Hogwarts policy for dealing with
infractions of hallway discipline, and that I did not feel it was
appropriate for a Hogwarts professor to do what he had done."</p>
<p>"And what did Professor Quirrell say to that?" said Harry, who
was not impressed with Hogwarts's current policies for enforcing
hallway discipline.</p>
<p>The Headmaster wore a look of resignation. "He said: <em>Fire
me</em>."</p>
<p>Somehow Harry managed not to cheer out loud.</p>
<p>The Headmaster frowned. "But <em>why</em> did he do it,
Harry?"</p>
<p>"Because Professor Quirrell doesn't like school bullies and I
asked very politely," said Harry. <em>And he was feeling bored and
I thought this might cheer him up.</em> "Either that or it's part
of some incredibly deep plot."</p>
<p>The Headmaster rose up from behind the desk, began to pace back
and forth before the hatstand that held the Sorting Hat and the red
slippers. "Harry, do you not feel that all of this has gotten a
bit..."</p>
<p>"Awesome?" offered Harry.</p>
<p>"<em>Utterly and completely out of hand</em> would say it
better," said Dumbledore. "I am not sure there has ever been a time
in the whole history of this school when things have become so,
so... I don't have a word for this, Harry, because things have
never become like this before, and so no one has ever needed to
invent a word for it."</p>
<p>Harry would have tried to invent words to express how deeply
complimented he felt, if he hadn't been snerkling too hard to
speak.</p>
<p>The Headmaster was regarding him with increasing graveness.
"Harry, do you understand <em>at all</em> why I find these events
concerning?"</p>
<p>"Honestly?" said Harry. "No, not really. I mean, of course
Professor McGonagall would object to anything that breaks up the
dull monotony of the Hogwarts school experience. But then Professor
McGonagall wouldn't set a chicken on fire."</p>
<p>The frown lines deepened on Dumbledore's wrinkled face. "That,
Harry, is not what disturbs me," the Headmaster said quietly.
"There was a full battle fought in these halls!"</p>
<p>"Headmaster," Harry said, trying to keep his voice carefully
respectful, "Professor Quirrell and I did not choose for that
battle to happen. The bullies did that. <em>We</em> just decided to
have the Light side win. I know there are times where the
boundaries of morality are uncertain, but in this case the line
separating the villains and the heroines was twenty meters tall and
drawn in white fire. Our intervention may have been <em>weird</em>,
but it certainly wasn't <em>wrong</em> -"</p>
<p>Dumbledore had gone back to his desk, sat down in his padded
throne with a dull thump, and was now covering his face with both
his hands.</p>
<p>"Am I missing something here?" Harry said. "I thought you'd be
secretly on our side, Headmaster. It was the Gryffindor thing to
do. The Weasley twins would approve, <em>Fawkes</em> would approve
-" Harry glanced at the golden perch, but it was empty; either the
phoenix had more important things to do, or the Headmaster hadn't
invited him to today's meeting.</p>
<p>"That," said the Headmaster in an old and tired and somewhat
muffled voice, "is precisely the problem, Harry. There is a reason
why courageous young heroes are not put in charge of schools."</p>
<p>"All right," Harry said. He couldn't quite keep the skepticism
out of his voice. "What am I missing this time?"</p>
<p>The old wizard lifted his head, his face now solemn, and calmer.
"Listen, Harry," said Dumbledore, "hear me well; for all who wield
power must learn this in time. Some things in this world are,
indeed, truly simple. If you pick up a stone and drop it again, the
earth will be no heavier for it, the stars will not move from their
paths. I say this, Harry, so that you know I am not pretending to
be wise, when I tell you that even as some things are simple,
others are complex. There are greater wizardries which leave marks
upon the world, and marks upon those who wield them, as a simple
Charm would <em>not</em>. Those wizardries demand hesitation,
consideration of consequence, a moment to weigh the meaning of
their marks. And yet the most intricate magics known to me are
simpler than the simplest soul. <em>People</em>, Harry, people are
always marked, by what they do and by what is done to them. Do you,
then, understand how to say, 'Here is the line between hero and
villain!' is not enough to say that what you did was right?"</p>
<p>"Headmaster," Harry said evenly, "this is not a decision I made
at random. No, I don't know what exact effect this will have on
every single one of the bullies present. But if I always waited for
perfect information before I acted, I would never do anything. When
it comes to the future psychological development of, say, Peregrine
Derrick, beating up eight first-year girls probably wouldn't have
been good for him. And it wasn't enough to just stop them quietly
and quickly, since then they would just try again later; they had
to see that there was a protective power worth fearing." Harry's
voice stayed level. "But of course, since I <em>am</em> a good guy,
I didn't want to permanently injure them or even cause them any
pain; and yet the penalty had to be enough to weigh on the minds of
anyone thinking about trying it again. So, after weighing the
expected outcomes as best I could with my boundedly rational
intellect, I thought it would be wisest to strip the bullies naked
and glue them to the ceiling."</p>
<p>The young hero stared directly into the old wizard's gaze,
unflinching green eyes locked with the blue behind the
spectacles.</p>
<p><em>And since I wasn't there and didn't do anything personally,
there's no lawful way to punish me under the Hogwarts school rules;
the only one who acted was Professor Quirrell, and he's fireproof.
And just breaking the rules to get at me wouldn't be a wise thing
to do to the hero you're grooming to fight Lord Voldemort...</em>
This time Harry actually <em>had</em> tried to think through all
the ramifications in advance, before he'd made the suggestion to
Professor Quirrell; and for once the Defense Professor hadn't
called him a fool, just slowly smiled and then begun to laugh.</p>
<p>"I understand your intentions, Harry," the old wizard said. "You
think you have taught the bullies of Hogwarts a lesson. But if
Peregrine Derrick could learn that lesson, he would not be
Peregrine Derrick. He will only be provoked more by what you do -
it is not fair, it is not right, but that is the way it is." The
old wizard closed his eyes, as though in brief pain, and then
opened them again. "Harry, the most painful truth any hero must
learn is that the right cannot, should not, must not win every
battle. All of this began when Miss Granger fought three older
enemies and won. If she had been content with this, the echoes of
her deed would have died away in time. Yet instead she banded
together with her classmates and raised her wand in open challenge
to Peregrine Derrick and all his kind; and his kind cannot but
raise their own wands in answer. So Jaime Astorga went hunting her,
and in the natural course he would have beaten her; it would have
been a sad day, but it would have ended there. There is not enough
magic in eight first-year witches all together to defeat such a
foe. But you could not accept that, Harry, could not let Miss
Granger learn her own lessons; and so you sent the Defense
Professor to watch over them invisibly, and pierce Astorga's
shields when Daphne Greengrass struck at him -"</p>
<p><em>What?</em> thought Harry.</p>
<p>The old wizard went on speaking. "Each time you intervened,
Harry, it escalated matters further and yet further. Soon Miss
Granger was facing Robert Jugson himself, the son of a Death Eater,
with two strong allies at his side. Painful indeed it would have
been for her, if Miss Granger had lost that battle. And yet again
by your will and Quirinus's hand, this time shown more openly, she
won."</p>
<p>Harry was still struggling with the notion of the Defense
Professor watching invisibly over S.P.H.E.W., guarding the heroines
from harm.</p>
<p>"And so," the old wizard finished, "that is how we came to
today, Harry, to forty-four students attacking eight first-year
witches. A full battle in these halls! I know it was not your
intent, but you must accept some measure of responsibility. Such
things did not happen before you came to this school, not through
all my decades in Hogwarts; neither when I was a student nor when I
was a Professor."</p>
<p>"Thank you very much," Harry said evenly. "Though I think
Professor Quirrell deserves more credit than me."</p>
<p>The blue eyes widened. "Harry..."</p>
<p>"Those bullies were attacking victims long before this year,"
Harry said. Despite his best efforts, his voice was starting to
rise. "But nobody seems to have taught the students that they're
allowed to fight <em>back.</em> I know it's much harder to
<em>ignore</em> a two-sided fight than some helpless victims
getting hexed or almost pushed out of windows, but it's not exactly
<em>worse,</em> is it? I wish I'd read more of Godric Gryffindor's
writings so I could quote him, there's got to be something in there
about this. Open battle may be <em>louder</em> than the victims
suffering in silence, it may be harder to pretend that nothing is
happening, but the final result is better -"</p>
<p>"No, it is not," Dumbledore said. "It is not, Harry. To
<em>always</em> fight the darkness, to <em>never</em> let evil pass
unchallenged - that is not heroism, but simple pride. Even Godric
Gryffindor did not think that every war was worth fighting, though
he went his whole life from one battle to another." The old
wizard's voice went quieter. "In truth, Harry, the words you speak
- they are not evil. No, not evil, and yet they have frightened me.
You are one who might someday wield great power, over wizardry,
over your fellow wizards. And if, come that day, you still think
that evil must never pass unchallenged -" Now a note of real worry
had entered the Headmaster's voice. "The world has grown more
fragile since the age when Hogwarts was raised; I fear it cannot
bear the fury of another Godric Gryffindor. And he was slower to
his wrath than you." The old wizard shook his head. "You are too
ready to fight, Harry. Much too ready to fight, and Hogwarts itself
is becoming a more violent place around you."</p>
<p>"Well," Harry said carefully, after weighing his words. "I don't
know if it will help to say this, but I think you're getting the
wrong impression of what I'm all about. I don't like real fighting
either. It's scary, and violent, and somebody might get hurt. But I
<em>didn't</em> fight today, Headmaster."</p>
<p>The Headmaster frowned. "You sent the Defense Professor in your
place -"</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell didn't do any fighting either," Harry said
calmly. "There wasn't anyone there strong enough to fight him. What
happened today wasn't fighting, it was winning."</p>
<p>It was a while then before the old wizard spoke. "That may be as
it may be," the Headmaster said, "but all these conflicts must end.
I can hear the strain in the air, and with each of these clashes,
it rises. All this must end, decisively and soon; you must not
stand in the way of its ending."</p>
<p>The old wizard gestured toward the great oaken door of his
office, and Harry departed through it.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>It was with some surprise that Harry stepped out from between
the huge grey gargoyles which had made way for him, and saw that
Quirinus Quirrell was still slumped against the stone of the
corridor wall, a thick thread of spittle drooling from his slack
mouth onto his Professorial robes, in just the same position he'd
occupied when Harry had first gone up into the Headmaster's
office.</p>
<p>Harry waited, but the slumped man didn't rise up; and after long
awkward seconds, Harry began to walk down the corridor again.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter?" came a soft call, after Harry had turned two
corners; a quiet voice carrying unnaturally through the halls.</p>
<p>When Harry had returned he found Professor Quirrell still
slumped against the wall, but the pale eyes now watched him with
keen intelligence.</p>
<p><em>I'm sorry to have tired you out -</em></p>
<p>It was something that Harry couldn't say. He'd noticed the
correlation between the effort Professor Quirrell expended and the
time he had to spend 'resting'. But Harry had reasoned that if the
effort was too painful or detrimental, surely Professor Quirrell
would just say no. Now Harry was wondering if that reasoning had
actually been correct, and if not, how to apologize...</p>
<p>The Defense Professor spoke in a quiet voice, the rest of the
body unmoving. "How went your meeting with the Headmaster, Mr.
Potter?"</p>
<p>"I'm not sure," Harry said. "Not the way I predicted. He seems
to believe the Light should lose a lot more often than I'd consider
wise. Plus I'm not sure he understands the difference between
trying to fight and trying to win. It explains a lot, actually..."
Harry hadn't read much about the Wizarding War, but he'd read
enough to know that the good guys probably <em>had</em> acquired a
pretty accurate picture of who most of the worst Death Eaters were,
and <em>hadn't</em> just owled them all hand grenades over the
course of five minutes.</p>
<p>A soft, soft laugh from the pale lips. "Dumbledore does not
comprehend the enjoyment of winning, just as he does not comprehend
the enjoyment of the game. Tell me, Mr. Potter. Did you suggest
this little plan with the deliberate intention of relieving my
tedium?"</p>
<p>"That was among my many motives," Harry said, because some
instinct had warned that he couldn't just say <em>Yes</em>.</p>
<p>"Do you know," the Defense Professor said in soft reflective
tones, "there are those who have tried to soften my darker moods,
and those who have indeed participated in brightening my day, but
you are the first person ever to succeed in doing it deliberately?"
The Defense Professor seemed to straighten up from the wall with a
peculiar motion which might have included magic as well as muscle;
and the Defense Professor began to walk away without a look back in
Harry's direction. Only a single small gesture of one finger
indicated that Harry was to follow.</p>
<p>"I particularly enjoyed that chant you composed for Miss Davis,"
said Professor Quirrell after they had walked a short distance.
"Though you might have been wiser to consult me in advance, before
giving it to her to memorize." One hand bestirred itself to within
the Defense Professor's robes and drew forth a wand, which traced a
small gesture in the air, after which all the faraway sounds of the
castle Hogwarts fell silent. "Tell me honestly, Mr. Potter, have
you somehow acquired a familiarity with the theory of Dark rituals?
That is not the same as confessing an intent to cast them; many
wizards know the principles."</p>
<p>"No..." Harry said slowly. He had decided some time ago against
trying to sneak into the Restricted Section of the Hogwarts
library, for much the same reason he'd decided a year earlier
<em>not</em> to look up how to make explosives out of common
household materials. Harry prided himself on at least having
<em>more</em> sense than people thought he did.</p>
<p>"Oh?" said Professor Quirrell. The man was walking more normally
now, and the lips curved about in a peculiar smile. "Why, perhaps
you possess a natural talent for the field, then."</p>
<p>"Yes, well," Harry said wearily. "I suppose Dr. Seuss also has a
natural talent for Dark rituals, because the part about
<em>shuffle, duffle, muzzle, muff</em> came from a children's book
called <em>Bartholomew and the Oobleck</em> -"</p>
<p>"No, not that part," said Professor Quirrell. His voice grew a
little stronger, took on some of its normal lecturing tone. "An
ordinary Charm, Mr. Potter, can be cast merely by speaking certain
words, making precise motions of the wand, expending some of your
own strength. Even powerful spells may be invoked in this way, if
the magic is efficient as well as efficacious. But with the
greatest of magics, speech alone does not suffice to give them
structure. You must perform specific actions, make significant
choices. Nor is the temporary expenditure of your own strength
sufficient to set them in motion; a ritual requires permanent
sacrifice. The power of such a greater spell, compared to ordinary
Charms, can be like day compared to night. But many rituals -
indeed, most - happen to demand at least one sacrifice which might
inspire squeamishness. And so the entire field of ritual magic,
containing all the furthest and most interesting reaches of
wizardry, is widely regarded as Dark. With a few exceptions carved
out by tradition, of course." Professor Quirrell's voice took on a
sardonic tinge. "The Unbreakable Vow is too useful to certain
wealthy Houses to be outlawed entirely - even though to bind a
man's will through all his days is indeed a dread and terrible act,
more fearsome than many lesser rituals that wizards shun. A cynic
might conclude that which rituals are prohibited is not so much a
matter of morality, as habit. But I digress..." Professor Quirrell
made a brief coughing sound, a clearing of his throat. "The
Unbreakable Vow requires three participants and three sacrifices.
The one who receives the Unbreakable Vow must be one who could have
come to trust the Vower, but chooses instead to demand the Vow from
them, and they sacrifice that possibility of trust. The one who
makes the Vow must be someone who could have chosen to do what the
Vow demands of them, and they sacrifice that capacity for choice.
And the third wizard, the binder, permanently sacrifices a small
portion of their own magic, to sustain the Vow forever."</p>
<p>"Ah," Harry said. "I'd <em>wondered</em> why that spell wasn't
used all over the place, every time two people have difficulty
trusting each other... although... why don't wizards on their
deathbeds charge money to bind Unbreakable Vows, and use that to
leave an inheritance for their children -"</p>
<p>"Because they are stupid," said Professor Quirrell. "There are
hundreds of useful rituals which could be performed if men had so
much sense; I could name twenty without stopping to draw breath.
But in any case, Mr. Potter, the thing about such rituals - whether
or not you choose to term them Dark - is that they are shaped to be
magically efficacious, not to appear impressive when performed. I
suppose there is a certain tendency for the more powerful rituals
to require more dreadful sacrifices. Even so, the most terrible
ritual known to me demands only a rope which has hanged a man and a
sword which has slain a woman; and that for a ritual which promised
to summon Death itself - though what is truly meant by that I do
not know and do not care to discover, since it was also said that
the counterspell to dismiss Death had been lost. The most dread
chant I have encountered does not sound even a hundredth as
fearsome as the chant you composed for Miss Davis. Those among the
bullies who had a passing familiarity with Dark rituals - and I am
certain that there were some - must have been terrified beyond the
capacity of words to describe. If there existed a true ritual which
appeared that impressive, Mr. Potter, it would melt the Earth."</p>
<p>"Um," said Harry.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's lips twisted further. "Ah, but the truly
amusing thing was this. You see, Mr. Potter, the chant of every
ritual names that which is to be sacrificed, and that which is to
be gained. The chant which you gave to Miss Davis spoke, first, of
a darkness beyond darkness, buried beneath the flow of time, which
knows the gate, and is the gate. And the second thing spoken of,
Mr. Potter, was the manifestation of your own presence. And always,
in each element of the ritual, <em>first</em> is named that which
is sacrificed, and <em>then</em> is said the use commanded of
it."</p>
<p>"I... see," said Harry, as he trod through the halls of Hogwarts
after Professor Quirrell, following him toward the Defense
Professor's office. "So my chant, the way I wrote it, implies that
the Outer God, Yog-Sothoth -"</p>
<p>"Was permanently sacrificed in a ritual which but briefly
manifested your presence," said Professor Quirrell. "I suppose we
will discover tomorrow whether anyone took that seriously, when we
read the newspapers and see whether all the magical nations of the
world are banding together in a desperate effort to seal off your
incursion into our reality."</p>
<p>They walked on, as the Defense Professor began chuckling, odd
throaty sounds.</p>
<p>The two of them didn't talk after that until they came to the
Defense Professor's office, and then the man halted with his hand
upon the door.</p>
<p>"It is a very strange thing," the Defense Professor said, his
voice now soft again, almost inaudible. The man was not looking at
Harry, and Harry saw only his back. "A very strange thing... There
was a time when I would have sacrificed a finger from my wand hand,
to work upon the bullies of Hogwarts as we have worked upon them
this day. To make them fear me as they now fear you, to have the
deference of all the students and the adoration of many, I would
have given my finger for that. You have everything now that I
wanted then. All that I know of human nature says that I should
hate you. And yet I do not. It is a very strange thing."</p>
<p>It should have been a touching moment, but instead Harry felt a
coldness traveling down his spine, as though he were a little fish
in the sea, and some vast white shark had just looked him over and
decided after a visible hesitation not to eat him.</p>
<p>The man opened the door to Defense Professor's office, and
passed within, and was gone.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Aftermath:</em></p>
<p>Her fellow Slytherins were looking at Daphne like... like they
didn't have the faintest idea of how to look at her.</p>
<p>The Gryffindors were looking at her like they didn't have the
faintest idea of how to look at her.</p>
<p>Showing no fear, Daphne Greengrass strode into the Potions
classroom, wrapped in the imperious dignity of a Noble and Most
Ancient House. Inside she was feeling much the same way everyone
else probably did.</p>
<p>It had been two hours since the <em>What?</em> when the
<em>What?</em> had happened and Daphne's brain was still going:
<em>What? What? What?</em></p>
<p>The classroom was quiet as they all waited for Professor Snape
to arrive. Lavender and Parvati sat near a cluster of other
Gryffindors, surrounded by silent stares. The two of them were
looking over each other's homework before class started, and nobody
else was helping them or talking to them. Even Lavender, who Daphne
would have sworn could never be fazed by anything, seemed
subdued.</p>
<p>Daphne sat down at her desk, and took <em>Magical Draughts and
Potions</em> out of her bag, and began looking over her own
homework, doing her very best to act normal. People stared at her,
and said nothing -</p>
<p>A gasp went through the whole classroom. Girls and boys flinched
back, leaning away from the door like they were stalks of wheat
touched by a gust of wind.</p>
<p>In the door stood Tracey Davis, wrapped in a black tattered
cloak which had been draped over her Hogwarts uniform.</p>
<p>Tracey walked slowly into the classroom, swaying slightly with
each step, looking like she was trying to <em>drift</em>. She sat
down at her accustomed desk, which happened to be right next to
Daphne's.</p>
<p>Slowly Tracey's head turned to stare at Daphne.</p>
<p>"See?" the Slytherin girl said in a low, sepulchral tone. "I
told you I'd get him before she did."</p>
<p>"What?" blurted Daphne, who immediately wished she hadn't said
anything.</p>
<p>"I got Harry Potter before Granger did." Tracey's voice was
still low, but her eyes were gleaming with triumph. "See, Daphne,
what General Potter wants in a girl isn't a pretty face or a pretty
dress. He wants a girl willing to channel his dread powers, that's
what he wants. Now I'm his - and he's mine!"</p>
<p>This announcement produced a frozen silence through the whole
classroom.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, Miss Davis," said the cultured voice of Draco
Malfoy, who seemed unconcerned as he shuffled through his own
Potions parchments. The other scion of a Most Ancient House didn't
so much as glance up from his desk, even as everyone else turned to
look at him. "Did Harry Potter actually <em>tell</em> you that?
Using those words?"</p>
<p>"Well, no..." Tracey said, and then her eyes flashed angrily.
"But he'd <em>better</em> take me in, now that I've sacrificed my
soul to him and everything!"</p>
<p>"<em>You sacrificed your soul to Harry Potter?</em> " gasped
Millicent. There was a clatter from the other side of the room as
Ron Weasley dropped his inkwell.</p>
<p>"Well, I'm pretty sure I did," said Tracey, sounding briefly
uncertain before she rallied. "I mean, I looked at myself in a
mirror and I look paler now, and I can always feel darkness
surrounding me, and I was a conduit for his dread powers and
everything... Daphne, you also saw my eyes go green, right? I
didn't see it myself but that's what I heard afterward."</p>
<p>There was a pause, broken only by the sounds of Ron Weasley
trying to clean up his desk.</p>
<p>"Daphne?" said Tracey.</p>
<p>"I don't believe it," said an angry voice. "There's no way the
next Dark Lord would take <em>you</em> to be his bride!"</p>
<p>Slowly, and with considerable disbelief, heads turned to stare
at Pansy Parkinson.</p>
<p>"Hush, you," said Tracey, "or I'll..." The Slytherin girl
paused. Then Tracey's voice went even lower, and she said, "Hush,
you, or I'll devour your soul."</p>
<p>"You can't do that," said Pansy, in the confident tones of a hen
which had worked out a perfectly good pecking order where she was
at the top, and wasn't about to go updating that belief based on
mere evidence.</p>
<p>Slowly, like she was trying to float, Tracey got up from her
desk. There were more gasps. Daphne felt like she'd been Petrified
in place within her chair.</p>
<p>"Tracey?" said Lavender in a small voice. "Please don't do all
that again. Please?"</p>
<p>Now Pansy was showing definite nervousness as Tracey swayed
toward her desk. "What d'you think you're doing?" Pansy said, not
quite managing to sound indignant.</p>
<p>"I told you," Tracey said menacingly. "I'm going to devour your
soul."</p>
<p>Tracey bent down over Pansy, who sat frozen at her desk; and,
with their lips almost touching, made a loud inhaling noise.</p>
<p>"There!" said Tracey as she straightened. "I ate your soul."</p>
<p>"No you didn't!" said Pansy.</p>
<p>"Did too!" said Tracey.</p>
<p>There was a very slight pause -</p>
<p>"Merlin, she <em>did!</em> " cried Theodore Nott. "You look all
pale now, and your eyes seem empty!"</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " screeched Pansy, turning pale. The girl leapt
up from her desk and began frantically rummaging through her
bookbag. After Pansy drew out a mirror and looked at herself, she
turned even paler.</p>
<p>Daphne abandoned all pretense of aristocratic poise and let her
head fall to the desk with a dull thud, as she wondered whether
going to the same school as all the other important families was
really worth going to the same school as the Chaos Legion.</p>
<p>"Ooh, you're in trouble now, Pansy," said Seamus Finnigan. "I
don't know exactly what happens when a Dementor Kisses you, but if
Tracey Davis kisses you that's probably even worse."</p>
<p>"I've heard about people without souls," Dean Thomas said
gloomily. "They have to dress all in black, and they write awful
poetry, and nothing ever makes them happy. They're all
<em>angsty</em>."</p>
<p>"I don't want to be angsty!" cried Pansy.</p>
<p>"Too bad," said Dean Thomas. "You've got to be, now that your
soul's gone."</p>
<p>Pansy turned, and stretched out a begging hand toward Draco
Malfoy's desk. "Draco!" she said pleadingly. "Mr. Malfoy! Please,
make Tracey give me back my soul!"</p>
<p>"I can't," said Tracey. "I <em>ate</em> it."</p>
<p>"Make her throw it up!" yelled Pansy.</p>
<p>The heir of Malfoy had slumped forward, resting his head in both
hands, so that nobody could see his face. "Why is my life like
this?" said Draco Malfoy.</p>
<p>A wild babble of whispers started up as Tracey returned to her
desk, now smiling in satisfaction, while Pansy stood in the midst
of the classroom, wringing her hands and tears starting from her
eyes -</p>
<p><em>"Be. Quiet."</em></p>
<p>The soft, lethal voice seemed to fill the whole classroom as
Professor Snape stalked in through the door. His face was angrier
than Daphne had ever seen it, sending a jolt of genuine fear down
her spine. Hastily she looked down at her homework.</p>
<p>"Sit down, Parkinson," the Potions Master hissed, "and you,
Davis, take off that ridiculous cloak -"</p>
<p>"<em>Professor Snaaaaaape!</em> " wailed Pansy Parkinson in
tears. "<em>Tracey ate my sooouuul!</em> "</p>

<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 75: Self Actualization Final,
Responsibility<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>It was a looping, meandering alley in the midst of Hogwarts,
wandering like a stray lock of hair; sometimes crossing itself, it
seemed, but you couldn't ever get to the end if you gave into the
temptation of apparent shortcuts.</p>
<p>At the end of the tangle, six students leaned against rough
stones, robes black against the grey walls and trimmed in green,
eyes darting from one to each other. Torches burned in the
windowless sconce, casting light to ward off the darkness and heat
to ward off the chill of the Slytherin dungeons.</p>
<p>"I am <em>certain,</em>" Reese Belka snapped, "absolutely
<em>certain,</em> that was no true ritual. Little firstie witches
can't do that kind of magic, and even if they could, who's ever
heard of a Dark ritual which <em>sacrifices</em> a sealed horror
for - <em>that?</em> "</p>
<p>"Were you -" said Lucian Bole. "I mean - after that girl snapped
her fingers -"</p>
<p>Belka's glare should have melted him. "No," she spat, "I was
<em>not.</em>"</p>
<p>"That is, she wasn't naked," drawled Marcus Flint, his broad
shoulders leaning back in apparent relaxation against the lumpy
stone surface. "Covered in chocolate frosting, yes, but not
naked."</p>
<p>"This day Potter has offered great insult to our Houses," said
the grim voice of Jaime Astorga.</p>
<p>"Yes, well, I'm sorry to be blunt," Randolph Lee said evenly.
The seventh-year duelist rubbed at his chin, where a faint fuzz of
beard had been allowed to grow. "But when someone sticks you to the
ceiling, it's a message, Astorga. It's a message which says: I'm an
incredibly powerful Dark Wizard who could've done anything to you I
damn well pleased, and I don't care if your House is offended,
either."</p>
<p>Robert Jugson III gave a soft, low laugh at this, a chuckle that
sent chills down several spines. "It makes you wonder if you picked
the wrong side, doesn't it? I've heard tales about
<em>messages</em> like that, sent at the old Dark Lord's
bidding..."</p>
<p>"I'm not ready to kneel to Potter just yet," said Astorga,
staring hard into Jugson's eyes.</p>
<p>"Neither am I," said Belka.</p>
<p>Jugson was holding his wand, and he turned it idly back and
forth in his fingers, pointing it up and then downward. "Are you a
Gryffindor or a Slytherin?" said Jugson. "Everyone's got a price.
Everyone smart."</p>
<p>This statement produced a moment of silence.</p>
<p>"Shouldn't Malfoy be here?" Bole said tentatively.</p>
<p>Flint gave a dismissive flick of his fingers. "Whatever Malfoy's
plotting, he wants to put on an air of innocence. He can't be seen
missing at the same time as us."</p>
<p>"But everyone <em>knows</em> that already," said Bole. "Even in
the other Houses."</p>
<p>"Yes, very clumsy," said Belka. She snorted. "Malfoy or no, he's
just a little firstie and we don't need him here."</p>
<p>"I will owl my father," Jugson said softly, "and <em>he</em>
will speak to Lord Malfoy himself -" Abruptly, Jugson stopped
speaking.</p>
<p>"I don't know about <em>you</em>, dearies," Belka said with fake
sweetness, "but <em>I</em> don't plan on running scared from a
false ritual, and <em>I'm</em> not done with Potter and his pet
mudblood."</p>
<p>Nobody answered. All their gazes were looking past her.</p>
<p>Slowly, Belka turned around to see what the others were staring
at.</p>
<p>"You will do <em>nothing,</em>" hissed their Head of House.
Severus Snape's face was enraged, when he spoke small spots of
spittle flew from his mouth, further dotting his already-dirtied
robes. "You fools have done <em>enough!</em> You have embarrassed
my House - <em>lost</em> to first-years - now you speak of
embroiling noble Lords of the Wizengamot in your <em>pathetic</em>
childish squabbles? <em>I</em> shall deal with this matter.
<em>You</em> will not embarrass this House again, you will not
<em>risk</em> embarrassing this House again! You are <em>done</em>
with fighting witches, and if I hear otherwise -"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>If you thought they'd be sitting next to each other at
dinnertime, after that, you'd be quite mistaken.</p>
<p>"What does she <em>want</em> from me?" came the plaintive cry of
a boy who, for all his extensive reading in the scientific
literature, was still a bit naive about certain things. "Did she
<em>want</em> to get beaten up?"</p>
<p>The upper-year Ravenclaw boys who'd sat down next to him at the
dinner-table exchanged swift glances with each other until, by some
unspoken protocol, the most experienced of their number spoke.</p>
<p>"Look," said Arty Grey, the seventh-year who was leading in
their competition by three witches and a Defense Professor, "the
thing you've got to understand is, just because she's
<em>angry</em> doesn't mean you lost points. Miss Granger is angry
because she got all frightened and you're <em>there to be
blamed,</em> you understand? But at the same time, even though she
won't admit it, she'll be touched that her boyfriend went to such
ridiculous and frankly insane lengths to protect her."</p>
<p>"This is not about <em>points,</em>" ground out Harry Potter,
the words visibly escaping from between his clenched teeth. Dinner
sat ignored on the table in front of him. "This is about
<em>justice.</em> And <em>I. Am. Not. Her. Boyfriend!</em> "</p>
<p>This was met by a certain amount of sniggering from all
present.</p>
<p>"Yeah, well," said a sixth-year Ravenclaw boy, "I think after
she kisses you to bring you out of Dementation and you stick
forty-four bullies to the ceiling for her, we've gone way past
'she's not my girlfriend, really' and into the question of what
your kids will be like. Wow, that's a scary thought..." The
Ravenclaw trailed off and then said, in a smaller voice, "Please
don't look at me like that."</p>
<p>"Look," said Arty Grey, "I'm sorry to be blunt about this, but
you can have justice or you can have girls, you can't have both at
the same time." He clapped a companionable hand on Harry Potter's
shoulder. "You've got potential, kid, more potential than any
wizard I've ever seen, but you've got to learn how to <em>use</em>
it, you know? Be a bit sweeter to them, learn some spells to clean
up that mess you call hair. Above all, you need to hide your
evilness better - not <em>too</em> well, but better. Nice
well-groomed boys get girls, and Dark Wizards also get girls, but
nice well-groomed boys suspected of being <em>secretly</em> Dark
get more girls than you can imagine -"</p>
<p>"Not interested," Harry said flatly, as he picked up the boy's
hand from his shoulder and unceremoniously dropped it.</p>
<p>"But you will be," said Arty Grey, his voice low and foreboding.
"Ah, you will be!"</p>
<p>Elsewhere along the same table -</p>
<p>"<em>Romantic?</em> " shrieked Hermione Granger, so loudly that
some of the girls next to her winced. "<em>What part of that was
romantic?</em> He didn't <em>ask!</em> He never <em>asks!</em> He
just sends ghosts after people and glues them to ceilings and does
whatever he wants with <em>my</em> life!"</p>
<p>"But don't you see?" said a fourth-year witch. "It means that
even though he's evil, he <em>loves</em> you!"</p>
<p>"You're not helping," said Penelope Clearwater a little further
down the table, but she was ignored. Several older witches had
started toward Hermione, after she'd sat down at the extreme
opposite end of the table from Harry Potter, but then a swifter
cloud of younger girls had surrounded Hermione in an impenetrable
barrier.</p>
<p>"Boys," said Hermione Granger, "should not be allowed to love
girls without asking them first! This is true in a number of ways
and especially when it comes to gluing people to the ceiling!"</p>
<p>This was also ignored. "It's just like a play!" sighed a
third-year girl.</p>
<p>"A play?" said Hermione. "I'd like to see the play where
anything like <em>this</em> happens!"</p>
<p>"Oh," said the third-year girl, "I was thinking of that really
<em>romantic</em> one where there's this very nice, sweet boy who
makes a Floo call, only he mispronounces his destination and
stumbles out into this room full of Dark Wizards who are performing
a forbidden ritual that should've stayed forever lost to time, and
they're sacrificing seven victims in order to unseal this ancient
horror which is supposed to grant someone a wish if it's freed, so
of course the boy's presence interrupts the ritual, and as the
horror is eating all the Dark Wizards and everyone is dying the
boy's last thought is that he wishes he could've had a girlfriend,
and the next thing you know the boy is lying in the lap of this
beautiful woman whose eyes are burning with a dreadful light, only
she doesn't understand anything about being human so the boy always
has to stop her eating people. This is just like that play, only
you're the boy and Harry Potter is the girl!"</p>
<p>"That..." Hermione said, feeling quite surprised. "That actually
<em>does</em> sound something like -"</p>
<p>"It <em>does?</em> " blurted a second-year girl sitting across
the table, who was now leaning forward, looking horrified and yet
even more fascinated.</p>
<p>"No!" said Hermione. "I mean - <em>he's not my
boyfriend!</em> "</p>
<p>Two seconds later, Hermione's ears caught up with what her lips
had just said.</p>
<p>The fourth-year witch put her hand on Hermione's shoulder and
gave her a comforting squeeze. "Miss Granger," she said in a
soothing voice, "I think if you're really honest with yourself,
you'll admit that the real reason you're angry with your dark
master is that he channeled his unspeakable powers through Tracey
Davis instead of you."</p>
<p>Hermione's mouth opened but her throat locked up before the
words came out, which was probably a good thing, because if she'd
actually yelled that loudly it would've broken something.</p>
<p>"How's that possible, actually?" said the third-year girl. "I
mean for Harry Potter to work through another girl even though he's
bound himself to you? Do the three of you have one of those, you
know, arrangements?"</p>
<p>"<em>Gaaaaack,</em>" said Hermione Granger, her throat still
locked, her brain halted, and her vocal cords spontaneously making
a noise like she was coughing up a yak.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>(Later.)</em></p>
<p>"I don't understand why you're being so <em>unreasonable</em>,"
said another second-year witch, who'd replaced the third-year-girl
after Hermione had threatened to ask Tracey to eat her soul. "I
mean, really, if someone like Harry Potter rescued <em>me</em>, I'd
be - sending him thank-you cards, and hugging him, and," the girl's
face was a bit red, "well, kissing him, I'd hope."</p>
<p>"Yeah!" said the other second-year witch. "I've never understood
why girls in plays get <em>angry</em> when the main character goes
out of his way to be nice to them. <em>I</em> wouldn't act like
that if the hero liked <em>me.</em>"</p>
<p>Hermione Granger had dropped her head to the dinner table, her
hands slowly pulling at her hair.</p>
<p>"You just don't understand male psychology," the fourth-year
witch said in an authoritative voice. "Granger's got to make it
<em>look</em> like she can mysteriously resist his seductive
charm."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>(Even later.)</em></p>
<p>And so before long Hermione Granger had turned to the only
person left she could talk to, the only person guaranteed to
understand her point of view -</p>
<p>"They're all mad," said Hermione Granger as she strode
vigorously toward Ravenclaw tower, having left dinner a bit early.
"Everyone except you and me, Harry, I mean <em>everyone</em> except
us in this whole school of Hogwarts, they're all entirely
<em>mad.</em> And Ravenclaw girls are the <em>worst,</em> I don't
know <em>what</em> Ravenclaw girls go reading when they get older,
but I'm certain they ought not to be reading it. One witch asked me
if the two of us had soul-bonded, which I'm going to look up in the
library tonight, but I'm pretty sure has never actually happened
-"</p>
<p>"I don't even know a <em>name</em> for this kind of fallacious
reasoning," said Harry Potter. The boy was walking normally, which
meant he often had to skip forward a few steps to match her own
indignation-fueled speed. "I seriously think if it was up to
<em>them</em>, they'd be dragging us off this minute to get our
names changed to Potter-Evans-Verres-Granger... Ugh, saying that
out loud makes me realize how awful it sounds."</p>
<p>"You mean <em>your</em> name would be
Potter-Evans-Verres-Granger and <em>mine</em> would be
Granger-Potter-Evans-Verres," said Hermione. "It's too horrible to
imagine."</p>
<p>"No," said the boy, "House Potter is a Noble House, so I think
that name stays in front -"</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " she said indignantly. "Who says <em>we</em>
have to -"</p>
<p>There was a sudden awful silence, broken only by the thuds of
their shoes.</p>
<p>"<em>Anyhow,</em>" Hermione said hastily, "some of the crazy
things they said at dinner got me thinking, so I just want to say,
Harry, that I really am grateful to you for saving me and everybody
from getting beat up, and even though some parts of this afternoon
upset me, I'm sure we can just talk about it calmly."</p>
<p>"Ah..." Harry said with a faint and tentative smile, his eyes
showing a mixture of befuddlement and apprehension, "that's...
good, I guess?"</p>
<p>To be specific, there'd been the fourth-year witch explaining
that, since Harry was the evil wizard who'd fallen in love with
Hermione, and Hermione was the pure and innocent girl who would
either redeem him or get seduced by the Dark Arts herself, it
followed that Hermione <em>had</em> to be perpetually indignant at
anything Harry did, even if it was him heroically saving her from
certain doom, just so that their romance wouldn't resolve itself
before the end of Act IV. And <em>then</em> Penelope Clearwater,
who Hermione had really thought was smarter than that, had remarked
in a loud voice that for identical reasons it was
<em>impossible</em> for Hermione to just go over and talk sensibly
with Harry about why she was feeling hurt, and anyway Dark Wizards
were attracted to passionate defiance in a woman, not logic. This
was the point at which Hermione had shoved herself up from the
benches, stomped furiously over to where Harry was sitting, and
asked him in a reasonable voice if the two of them could go for a
walk and sort things out.</p>
<p>"So in other words," Hermione said in her calmest voice ever,
"you're not really in trouble with me, I'm still talking to you,
we're still friends, and we're still studying together. We're
<em>not</em> having a fight. Right?"</p>
<p>Somehow this only seemed to increase Harry Potter's
apprehension. "Right," said the Boy-Who-Lived.</p>
<p>"Great!" said Hermione. "So, <em>have</em> you worked out why I
was upset, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>There was a pause. "You wanted me to keep out of your affairs?"
Harry said cautiously. "I mean - I know you wanted to do things on
your own. And I <em>was</em> staying out of your way, until I'd
heard you'd gotten ambushed by three junior Death Eaters and,
honestly, I wasn't expecting that. <em>Professor Quirrell</em>
wasn't expecting that. I started to worry you'd gotten in over your
head and then, no offense Hermione, forty-four bullies in a massed
ambush is way beyond what <em>anyone</em> could handle without
help. That's why I thought you really needed help just that once
-"</p>
<p>"No, that part's fine," said Hermione. "We <em>were</em> in over
our heads, honestly. Please guess again, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>"Um," said Harry. "What Tracey did... startled you?"</p>
<p>"Startled me, Mr. Potter?" There might have been a touch of
acidity in her voice. "No, Mr. Potter, I was <em>scared.</em> I was
<em>frightened.</em> I wouldn't want to admit to being afraid of
just <em>dragons</em> or something, people might think I was
<em>cowardly</em>, but when you can hear distant voices crying
'Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!' and there's pools of blood seeping out from
under all the doors, then it's okay to be scared."</p>
<p>"I <em>am</em> sorry," Harry said with what sounded like genuine
regret. "I thought you'd realize it was me."</p>
<p>"And the <em>reason</em> we all got scared like that, Mr.
Potter, was that <em>you didn't ask first!</em> " Despite her
intentions, Hermione found her voice was rising again. "You
should've <em>asked</em> me before you did something like that,
Harry! You should've said very specifically, 'Hermione, can I make
blood come out from under the doors?' It's important to be specific
when you're asking about that sort of thing!"</p>
<p>The boy rubbed the back of his neck as he walked. "I...
honestly, I just thought you'd <em>have</em> to say no."</p>
<p>"Yes, Mr. Potter, <em>I could've said no</em>. That's <em>the
whole point of asking first</em>, Mr. Potter!"</p>
<p>"No, I mean you'd have <em>had</em> to say no, whether or not it
was what you <em>really</em> wanted. And then all of you would've
gotten beaten up and it would've been <em>my</em> fault for asking
first."</p>
<p>Hermione's eyebrows went up in a bit of surprise, and she kept
walking for a few steps while she tried to understand this. "What?"
she said.</p>
<p>"Well..." the boy said a bit slowly. "I mean... you're the
Sunshine General, aren't you? You <em>couldn't</em> say yes to me
scaring people, not even bullies, not even to save your friends
from getting beaten up. You would've <em>had</em> to say no, and
then you would've gotten hurt. This way, you can tell people
honestly that you had no idea and that it wasn't your fault. That's
why I didn't warn you."</p>
<p>Hermione stopped walking, turned to face Harry full on instead
of just turning her head. Her voice was carefully even as she said,
"Harry, you've <em>got</em> to stop coming up with clever reasons
for doing stupid things."</p>
<p>Harry's eyebrows flew up. After a moment he said, "Look... I
know what you mean, of course, but there's still the question of
whether it's actually <em>is</em> a good idea, not just a clever
one -"</p>
<p>"I understand why you did what you did today," Hermione said.
"But I want you to promise that from now on, you'll ask me first,
always, even if you can come up with a reason why you
shouldn't."</p>
<p>There was a pause that stretched, and Hermione could feel her
heart sinking.</p>
<p>"Hermione -" Harry started to say.</p>
<p>"<em>Why?</em> " The frustration burst out into her voice.
"<em>Why is it so awful? All you have to do is ask!"</em></p>
<p>Harry's eyes were very serious. "Who in S.P.H.E.W. do you try
hardest to defend, Hermione? Who are you most afraid for, when you
fight?"</p>
<p>"Hannah Abbott," Hermione said without having to think about it,
and then felt a little bad, because Hannah <em>was</em> trying hard
and she <em>had</em> improved a lot -</p>
<p>"Would you feel okay about trusting someone else, like Tracey,
with <em>final</em> responsibility for protecting Hannah? If you
knew Hannah was about to walk into an ambush, and you came up with
a plan for protecting her, would you feel good about letting Tracey
say whether or not you were allowed to do it?"</p>
<p>"Well... no?" said Hermione, puzzled.</p>
<p>The green eyes of the Boy-Who-Lived were steady on hers. "Would
you trust <em>Hannah</em> to have the final say in whether she
needed protecting?"</p>
<p>"I -" said Hermione, and then paused. It was strange, she knew
the right answer and she also knew the right answer wasn't actually
true. Hannah was trying so hard to prove she wasn't afraid, even
though she <em>was,</em> and it was easy to see how the Hufflepuff
girl might try <em>too</em> hard -</p>
<p>Then Hermione realized the implication. "You think I'm like
<em>Hannah?</em> "</p>
<p>"Not... exactly..." Harry ran his hands through his mess of
hair. "Listen, Hermione, what would <em>you</em> have suggested
doing, if I'd warned you about an ambush by forty-four
bullies?"</p>
<p>"I would've done the <em>responsible</em> thing and told
<em>Professor McGonagall</em> and let <em>her</em> take care of
it," Hermione said promptly. "And <em>then</em> there wouldn't have
been darkness and people screaming and horrible blue light -"</p>
<p>But Harry just shook his head. "That's <em>not</em> the
responsible thing to do, Hermione. It's what someone playing the
<em>role</em> of a responsible girl would do. <em>Yes</em>, I
thought of going to Professor McGonagall. But she would've only
stopped the disaster <em>once.</em> Probably before any disturbance
happened in the first place, like by telling the bullies she knew.
If the bullies got punished just for plotting, it would be by
losing House points, or at worst a day's detention, not anything
that would really scare them. And then the bullies would have
<em>tried again</em>. Fewer of them, with better operational
security so I didn't hear about it. They would probably ambush
<em>one</em> of you, alone. Professor McGonagall doesn't have the
<em>authority</em> to do something scary enough to protect you -
and <em>she</em> wouldn't have overstepped her authority, because
she's not really responsible."</p>
<p>"<em>Professor McGonagall</em> isn't responsible?" Hermione said
incredulously. She jammed her hands on her hips, now openly glaring
at him. "Are you <em>nuts?"</em></p>
<p>The boy didn't blink. "You could call it heroic responsibility,
maybe," Harry Potter said. "Not like the usual sort. It means that
whatever happens, no matter what, it's <em>always</em> your fault.
Even if you tell Professor McGonagall, she's not responsible for
what happens, <em>you</em> are. Following the school rules isn't an
excuse, someone else being in charge isn't an excuse, even trying
your best isn't an excuse. There just aren't any excuses, you've
got to <em>get the job done no matter what</em>." Harry's face
tightened. "That's why I say you're not thinking responsibly,
Hermione. Thinking that your job is done when you tell Professor
McGonagall - that isn't heroine thinking. Like Hannah being beat up
is <em>okay</em> then, because it isn't <em>your fault</em>
anymore. Being a heroine means your job isn't finished until you've
done <em>whatever it takes</em> to protect the other girls,
<em>permanently.</em>" In Harry's voice was a touch of the steel he
had acquired since the day Fawkes had been on his shoulder. "You
can't think as if just following the rules means you've done your
duty."</p>
<p>"I think," Hermione said evenly, "that you and I might disagree
about some things, Mr. Potter. Like whether you or Professor
McGonagall is more <em>responsible</em>, and whether being
<em>responsible</em> usually involves people running around and
screaming, and how much it's a good idea to follow school rules.
And just because we disagree, Mr. Potter, doesn't mean that
<em>you</em> get the final say."</p>
<p>"Well," said Harry, "you asked what was <em>so</em> awful about
having to ask you first, and it was a surprisingly good question,
so I examined my mind and that's what I found. I think my real fear
is that if Hannah is in trouble and I come up with a way to save
her that seems weird or dark or something, you might not weigh the
consequences to Hannah. You might not accept the heroine's
responsibility of coming up with <em>some</em> way to save her,
somehow, no matter what. Instead you'd just carry out the
<em>role</em> of Hermione Granger, the sensible Ravenclaw girl; and
the <em>role</em> of Hermione Granger automatically says no,
whether or not she has a better plan in mind. And then forty-four
bullies will take turns beating up Hannah Abbott, and it'll all be
my fault because I <em>knew,</em> even if I didn't want reality to
be that way, I knew that was how it would go. I'm pretty sure that
was my secret, wordless, unutterable fear."</p>
<p>The frustration was building up inside her again. "It's
<em>my</em> life!" Hermione burst out. She could imagine what it
would be like with Harry messing with her all the time, constantly
inventing justifications not to ask her first and not to listen to
her objections. She shouldn't have to <em>win an argument</em> just
to - "There'll <em>always</em> be some reason, you can
<em>always</em> say I'm not thinking right! I want my <em>own
life!</em> Otherwise I'll walk away, I really will, I mean it
Harry."</p>
<p>Harry sighed. "This is exactly where I didn't want things to end
up, and here we are. You're afraid of just the same thing I am,
aren't you? Afraid that if <em>you</em> let go of the steering
wheel, we'll crash." The corners of his lips twisted, but it didn't
look like a real smile. "That's something I can understand."</p>
<p>"I don't think you understand <em>at all!</em> " Hermione said
sharply. "You said we'd be <em>partners,</em> Harry!"</p>
<p>That stopped him, she could see it stop him.</p>
<p>"How about this?" Harry said at last. "I'll promise to ask you
first before I do anything that could be interpreted as meddling in
your affairs. Only <em>you've</em> got to promise <em>me</em> to be
reasonable, Hermione. I mean <em>really</em>, genuinely, stop and
think for twenty seconds first, treat it as a real choice. The sort
of reasonableness where you realize I'm offering a way to protect
the other girls, and that if you automatically say <em>no</em>
without considering it properly, there's this <em>actual
consequence</em> where Hannah Abbott ends up in the hospital."</p>
<p>Hermione stared at Harry, as his recitation wound down.</p>
<p>"Well?" said Harry.</p>
<p>"I shouldn't have to make promises," she said, "just to be
<em>consulted</em> about <em>my own life.</em>" She turned from
Harry and began walking toward the Ravenclaw tower, not looking at
him. "But I'll think about it, anyway."</p>
<p>She heard Harry sigh, and after that they walked in silence for
a while, passing through an archway of some reddish metal like
copper, into a corridor that was just like the one they'd left
except that it was tiled in pentagons instead of squares.</p>
<p>"Hermione..." said Harry. "I've been watching you and thinking,
since the day you said you were going to be a hero. You've
<em>got</em> the courage. You'll fight for what's right, even in
the face of enemies that would scare other people away. You've
certainly got the raw intelligence for it, and you're probably a
better person inside than I am. But even so... well, to be honest,
Hermione... I can't quite see you filling Dumbledore's shoes,
leading magical Britain's fight against You-Know-Who. Not yet,
anyway."</p>
<p>Hermione had turned her head to stare at Harry, who just went on
walking, as though lost in thought. Fill <em>those</em> shoes?
She'd never tried to imagine herself that way. She'd never
<em>imagined</em> imagining herself that way.</p>
<p>"And maybe I'm wrong," Harry said as they walked. "Maybe I've
just read too many stories where the heroes never do the sensible
thing and follow the rules and tell their Professor McGonagalls, so
my brain doesn't think you're a proper storybook hero. Maybe it's
you who's the sane one, Hermione, and me who's just being silly.
But every time you talk about following rules or relying on
teachers, I get that same feeling, like it's bound up with this one
last thing that's stopping you, one last thing that puts your PC
self to sleep and turns you into an NPC again..." Harry let out a
sigh. "Maybe that's why Dumbledore said I should have wicked
stepparents."</p>
<p>"He said <em>what?</em> "</p>
<p>Harry nodded. "I still don't know whether the Headmaster was
joking or... the thing is, he was <em>right</em> in a way. I
<em>had</em> loving parents, but I never felt like I could trust
their decisions, they weren't <em>sane</em> enough. I always knew
that if I didn't think things through myself, I might get hurt.
Professor McGonagall will do whatever it takes to get the job done
<em>if</em> I'm there to nag her about it, she doesn't break rules
on her own without heroic supervision. Professor Quirrell really
<em>is</em> someone who gets things done no matter what, and he's
the only other person I know who notices stuff like the Snitch
ruining Quidditch. But <em>him</em> I can't trust to be
<em>good</em>. Even if it's sad, I think that's part of the
environment that creates what Dumbledore calls a hero - people who
don't have anyone else to shove final responsibility onto, and
that's why they form the mental habit of tracking everything
themselves."<em><br></em></p>
<p>Hermione didn't say anything to that, but she was thinking back
to something Godric Gryffindor had written near the end of his very
short autobiography. Briefly and without any explanation, because
the scroll had been meant to be copied by hand, centuries before
the Muggle printing press had inspired wizards to invent the
Reading-Writing Quill.</p>
<p><em>No rescuer hath the rescuer,</em> Godric Gryffindor had
written. <em>No Lord hath the champion, no mother and no father,
only nothingness above.</em></p>
<p>If <em>that</em> was the price of being a hero, Hermione wasn't
sure she wanted to pay it. Or maybe - though it wasn't the sort of
thing she would have thought, before she started hanging around
Harry - maybe Godric Gryffindor had gotten it <em>wrong</em>.</p>
<p>"Do you trust <em>Dumbledore?"</em> Hermione said. "I mean, he's
right here in our school and he's the most legendary hero in the
whole world -"</p>
<p>"He <em>was</em> the most legendary hero," said Harry. "Now he
sets chickens on fire. Honestly, does Dumbledore seem reliable to
<em>you?</em> "</p>
<p>Hermione didn't answer.</p>
<p>Side by side, the two of them began to climb huge wide spiral
stairs, the steps alternating between bronze metal and blue stone;
the final approach to where the Ravenclaw portrait waited to guard
their dorm with silly riddles.</p>
<p>"Oh, and I just thought of something I should tell you," Harry
said when they were about halfway up. "Since it affects your life
and all. Think of it as a sort of down payment -"</p>
<p>"What is it?" said Hermione.</p>
<p>"I predict S.P.H.E.W. is about to retire."</p>
<p>"<em>Retire?</em> " Hermione said, almost stumbling on one of
the stairs.</p>
<p>"Yeah," Harry said. "I mean, I could be wrong, but I suspect the
teachers are about to clamp down hard on fighting in the
corridors." Harry was grinning as he spoke, a glint in his eyes
behind the glasses hinting at secret knowledge. "Cast new wards to
detect offensive hexes, or start verifying reports of bullying
using Veritaserum - I can think of several ways they might shut it
down. But if I'm right, it's something to celebrate, Hermione, you
and all of you. You kicked up enough public ruckus that you got
them to actually <em>do</em> something about the bullying.
<em>All</em> the bullying."</p>
<p>Slowly, then, a smile began to creep up her lips, and as she
reached the top of the stairs and began walking toward the
Ravenclaw portrait for her riddle, Hermione felt rather lighter on
her feet, a wonderful lifting feeling spreading through her like
she'd been pumped full of helium.</p>
<p>Somehow, despite all the effort the eight of them had put in,
she hadn't expected <em>that</em> much, she hadn't expected it to
actually <em>work</em>.</p>
<p>They'd made a <em>difference...</em></p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>It was the end of breakfast-time on the next morning.</p>
<p>The students from every year sat very still in their benches,
all heads turned in the same direction, toward the Head Table,
before which one lone first-year girl stood rigid and motionless,
her head tilted back to stare up at the Head of House
Slytherin.</p>
<p>Professor Snape's face was twisted with fury and triumph,
vindictive as any painting of a Dark Wizard; and behind him the
other Professors sat at the Head Table, watching with faces as
though carved from stone.</p>
<p>"- permanently disbanded," spat the Potions Master. "Your
self-proclaimed Society is <em>outlawed</em> within Hogwarts, by my
decision as a Professor! If your Society or any member of it is
discovered fighting in the hallways again, Granger, you will be
<em>personally</em> held responsible and expelled, by me, from the
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!"</p>
<p>That first-year girl stood there, before the Head Table where
she'd been called before only to receive commendations and smiles;
stood there with her spine held tall and upright in its curve like
a centaur's bow, giving nothing to the enemy.</p>
<p>That first-year witch stood there with all tears and anger
bottled, her face still, nothing changing of her outward
appearance, while something slowly broke inside her, she could feel
it breaking.</p>
<p>It broke further when Professor Snape gave her two weeks
detention for the crime of violence in school, sneering with the
contemptuous face he'd shown them all on the first day of Potions,
and with a little twist in the corner of his smile that said the
Potions Master knew exactly how unfair he was being.</p>
<p>Whatever-it-was inside her cracked all the way through, from top
to bottom, when Professor Snape took one hundred points from
Ravenclaw.</p>
<p>It ended, then, and Snape told her she was dismissed.</p>
<p>She turned around and saw that at the Ravenclaw table, Harry
Potter was sitting still in his place, she couldn't see his
expression from here, she saw his fists on the table but she
couldn't see if they were clenched white like her own. She had
whispered to him, when Professor Snape had called her, that he
wasn't to do anything without asking first.</p>
<p>Hermione wheeled back again to look at the Head Table, just as
Snape was turning away from her to resume his place.</p>
<p>"I said you're dismissed, girl," said the sneering voice, but
there was a pleased smile on Snape's face, like he was waiting for
her to do something -</p>
<p>Hermione strode forward another five steps toward the Head Table
and said in a breaking voice, "Headmaster?"</p>
<p>Utter silence filled the Great Hall.</p>
<p>Headmaster Dumbledore said nothing, didn't move. It was as
though he, too, was just carved from stone.</p>
<p>Hermione turned her gaze to look at Professor Flitwick, whose
head, barely visible above the table, seemed to be staring down
into his lap. Beside him, Professor Sprout's face was very tight,
she seemed to be forcing herself to watch, and her lips were
trembling, but she said nothing.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall's chair was empty, the Deputy Headmistress
hadn't shown up to breakfast that morning.</p>
<p>"Why aren't any of you saying anything?" said Hermione Granger.
Her voice was trembling with the last of her hope, the last
desperate reach for help from that place inside her. "You
<em>know</em> what he's doing is wrong!"</p>
<p>"Two more weeks' detention, for insolence," Snape said
silkily.</p>
<p>It shattered.</p>
<p>She looked at the Head Table for a few seconds longer, at
Professor Flitwick and Professor Sprout and the empty place where
Professor McGonagall should've been. Then Hermione Granger turned
and began walking toward the Ravenclaw table.</p>
<p>There was a babble of voices starting up, as the students came
unfrozen from where they'd sat.</p>
<p>And then, as she was almost to the Ravenclaw table -</p>
<p>The dry voice of Professor Quirrell cut through everything, and
that voice said, "One hundred points to Miss Granger for doing what
is right."</p>
<p>Hermione almost fell over her own feet; and then she continued
forward, even as Snape shouted something furious, even as Professor
Quirrell leaned back in his chair and began to laugh, even as
Dumbledore's voice was saying something she didn't catch and then
she was sitting down at the Ravenclaw table again next to Harry
Potter.</p>
<p>Harry Potter was frozen beside her, he looked like someone who
didn't dare move.</p>
<p>"It's all right," her voice said to him, automatically without
there being any choice or thought involved, although really it
wasn't right at all. "But can you see if you can get me out of
Snape's detentions, like you did yourself that time?"</p>
<p>Harry Potter nodded, a single jerky motion of his head. "I -"
said Harry. "I - I'm sorry, this - this is all my fault -"</p>
<p>"Don't be <em>ridiculous</em>, Harry." It was odd how her voice
was coming out all normal, and without her thinking about what to
say. Hermione looked down at her breakfast plate, but eating seemed
to be clearly out of the question, there was a roiling and churning
in her stomach which suggested that she was already on the verge of
throwing up, which was odd because she could have sworn her whole
body felt numb, like she wasn't feeling anything, at the same
time.</p>
<p>"And," her voice said, "if you want to break school rules or
something, you can ask me about it, I promise I won't just say
no."</p>

Appearances<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p><em>Aftermath: Albus Dumbledore and -</em></p>
<p>The old wizard sat alone at his desk, in the unsilence of the
Headmaster's office, amid the innumerable and unnoticed devices;
his robes a gentle yellow, of soft fabric, not such clothing as he
ordinarily wore before others. His wrinkled hand held a quill
scratching away at an official-looking parchment. If you had
somehow been there to watch his lined face, you would have been
unable to deduce anything more about the man himself than you
understood of the enigmatic devices. You might have observed that
the face looked a little sad, a little tired, but then Albus
Dumbledore always looked like that when he was alone.</p>
<p>In the Floo hearth there were only scattered ashes without a
hint of flame, a magical door that had been shut so solidly as to
stop existing. On the material plane, the great oaken door to the
office had been closed and locked; beyond that door, the Endless
Stairs stayed motionless; at the bottom of those stairs, the
gargoyles that blocked the entrance did not flow, their pseudo-life
withdrawn to leave solid rock.</p>
<p>Then, even as the quill was in the middle of penning a word,
even as it was in the middle of scratching a letter -</p>
<p>The old wizard shot to his feet with a speed that would have
shocked anyone watching, abandoning the quill in mid-letter to fall
onto the parchment; like lightning he spun on the oaken door, his
yellow robes whirling around him and a wand of dread power leaping
into his hand -</p>
<p>And as abruptly, the old wizard paused, halting his motion even
as the wand came to bear.</p>
<p>A hand struck upon the oaken door, three times knocking.</p>
<p>More slowly, now, that grim wand went back into the dueling
holster strapped beneath the old wizard's sleeve. The ancient man
moved forward a few paces, drew himself up into a more formal
stance, composed his face. Nearby upon the desk, the quill moved to
the side of the parchment, as though it had been carefully placed
there rather than dropped in haste; and the parchment itself
flipped over to show blankness.</p>
<p>With a silent twitch of his will, the oaken door swung open.</p>
<p>Hard as stones, the green eyes glared at him.</p>
<p>"I admit that I am impressed, Harry," the old wizard said
quietly. "The Cloak of Invisibility would have let you evade my
lesser means of vision; but I did not sense my golems step aside,
nor the stairs turning. How did you come here?"</p>
<p>The boy walked into the office, step by deliberate step until
the door closed smoothly behind him. "I can go anywhere I choose,
with or without permission," that boy said. His voice seemed calm;
too calm, perhaps. "I am in your office because I decided to be
here, and to hell with passwords. You are greatly mistaken,
Headmaster Dumbledore, if you think that I stay in this school
because I am a prisoner here. I simply have not chosen,
<em>yet</em>, to leave. Now keeping that in mind, why did you
command your agent, Professor Snape, to break the agreement we made
in this office, that he would not torment any student in her fourth
year or below?"</p>
<p>The old wizard looked at the angry young hero for a long moment.
Then, slowly enough not to alarm the boy, those wizened fingers
drew open one of the manifold drawers of the desk, lifted out a
sheet of parchment, laid it upon the desk. "Fourteen," the old
wizard said. "It is not the number of all the owls sent last night.
Only the owls sent to families with a seat on the Wizengamot, or
families of great wealth, or families already allied with your
foes. Or, in the case of Robert Jugson, all three; for his father,
Lord Jugson, is a Death Eater, and his grandfather a Death Eater
who died by Alastor Moody's wand. What the letters said, I do not
know, but I can guess. Do you <em>still</em> not understand, Harry
Potter? Each time Hermione Granger <em>won</em>, as you put it, the
danger to her from Slytherin grew again, and yet again. But now the
Slytherins have triumphed over her, easily and safely, without
violence or lasting harm. They have won, and need fight no more..."
The old wizard sighed. "So I had planned. So I had hoped. So it
would have been, if the Defense Professor had not taken it upon
himself to intervene. Now the dispute goes to the Board of
Governors, where Severus will seem to conquer the Defense
Professor; but that will not feel the same to the Slytherins, it
will not have been over and finished in a moment, to their
satisfaction."</p>
<p>The boy advanced further into the room, his head tilting back
further to look up at the half-moon glasses; and somehow it was
like the boy was looking down at the Headmaster, rather than up.
"So this Lord Jugson is a Death Eater?" the boy said softly. "Good.
His life is already bought and paid for, then, and I can do
anything I want to him without ethical problems -"</p>
<p>"<em>Harry!</em> "</p>
<p>The boy's voice was clear as ice, frozen of purest water from
some untouched spring. "You seem to think that the Light should
live in fear of the darkness. I say it should be the other way
around. I'd prefer not to kill this Lord Jugson, even if he is a
Death Eater. But one hour of brainstorming with the Defense
Professor would be plenty of time to come up with some creative way
to wreck him financially, or get him exiled from magical Britain.
That would serve to make the point, I think."</p>
<p>"I confess," the old wizard said slowly, "that the thought of
ruining a five-hundred-year-old House, and challenging a Death
Eater to war to the finish, over a scuffle in a Hogwarts hallway,
had not occurred to me, Harry." The old wizard lifted a finger to
push back his half-moon glasses from where they had slid a little
down his nose, during his sudden motion earlier. "I daresay it
would not occur to Miss Granger either, nor to Professor
McGonagall, nor to Fred and George."</p>
<p>The boy shrugged. "It wouldn't <em>be</em> about the hallways,"
the boy said. "It would be justice for his past crimes, and I'd
only do it if Jugson made the first move. The point isn't to make
people scared of me as a wild card, after all. It's to teach them
that neutrals are perfectly safe from me, and poking me with a
stick is incredibly dangerous." The boy smiled in a way that didn't
reach his eyes. "Maybe I'll buy an ad in the Daily Prophet, saying
that anyone who wants to carry on this dispute with me will learn
the true meaning of Chaos, but anyone who leaves me alone will be
fine."</p>
<p>"<em>No</em>," the old wizard said. His voice was deeper now,
showing something of his true age and power. "No, Harry, that must
not be. You have not yet learned the meaning of fighting, what
truly happens when foes meet in battle. And so you dream, as young
boys do, of teaching your foes to fear you. It frightens me that
you, at far too young an age, might already have enough power to
make some part of your dreams into reality. There is <em>no</em>
turning of that road which does not lead into darkness, Harry,
none. That is the way of a Dark Lord, for certain."</p>
<p>The boy hesitated, then, and his eyes flickered to the empty
golden platform where Fawkes sometimes rested his wings. It was a
gesture that few would have caught, but the old wizard knew it very
well.</p>
<p>"All right, forget the part about teaching them to fear me," the
boy said then. His voice was no less hard, but some of the cold had
gone from it. "I still don't think you should let children get hurt
out of fear of what someone like Lord Jugson <em>might</em> do.
Protecting them is the whole point of your job. If Lord Jugson
really does try to get in your way, then do whatever it takes to
stop him. Give me full access to my vaults, and <em>I'll</em> take
personal responsibility for dealing with any fallout from banning
bullies in Hogwarts, whether it's Lord Jugson or anyone else."</p>
<p>Slowly the old wizard shook his head. "You seem to think, Harry,
that I need merely use my full power, and all foes will be swept
aside. You are wrong. Lucius Malfoy controls Minister Fudge,
through the <em>Daily Prophet</em> he sways all Britain, only by
bare margins does he not control enough of the Board of Governors
to oust me from Hogwarts. Amelia Bones and Bartemius Crouch are
allies, but even they would step aside if they saw us acting
wantonly. The world that surrounds you is more fragile than you
seem to believe, and we must walk with greater care. The old
Wizarding War never ended, Harry, it only continued in a different
form; the black king slept, and Lucius Malfoy moved his chesspieces
for a time. Do you think Lucius Malfoy would lightly permit you to
take a pawn of his color?"</p>
<p>The boy smiled, now with a touch of coldness again. "Okay, I'll
figure out some way to set it up so that it looks like Lord Jugson
betrayed his own side."</p>
<p>"Harry -"</p>
<p>"Obstacles mean you <em>get creative</em>, Headmaster. It
doesn't mean you abandon the children you're supposed to protect.
Let the Light win, and if trouble comes of it -" The boy shrugged.
"Let Light win again."</p>
<p>"So might phoenixes speak, if they had words," the old wizard
said. "But you do not understand the <em>phoenix's price.</em>"</p>
<p>The last two words were spoken in a peculiarly clear voice that
seemed to echo around the office, and then a huge rumbling noise
seemed to come from all around them.</p>
<p>Between the ancient shield on the wall and the Sorting Hat's
hatrack, the stone of the walls began to flow and move, pouring
itself into two framing columns and revealing a gap between them,
an opening that showed a set of stone stairs leading upward into
darkness.</p>
<p>The old wizard turned and strode toward those stairs, and then
looked back at where Harry Potter stood. "Come!" said the old
wizard. There was no twinkle now in those blue eyes. "Since you
have already gone so far as to force your way here uninvited, you
may as well go further."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>There were no railings on those stone steps, and after the first
few steps Harry drew his wand and cast <em>Lumos.</em> The
Headmaster did not look back, did not seem to be looking downward,
as though he had climbed the steps often enough to have no need of
vision.</p>
<p>The boy knew that he should have been curious, or frightened,
but there was no spare brain capacity for that. It was taking all
his control not to let the fury simmering inside him boil over any
further than it already had.</p>
<p>The stairs went on for only a short distance, one straight
rising flight without turns or curves.</p>
<p>At the top was a door of solid metal, looking black in the blue
light cast from Harry's wand, meaning that the metal itself was
either black or perhaps red.</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore lifted up his long wand like a brandished
symbol, and again spoke in that strange voice which seemed to echo
in Harry's ears, as though burning itself into his memory:
"<em>Phoenix's fate.</em>"</p>
<p>That last door opened, and Harry followed Dumbledore inside.</p>
<p>The room beyond seemed to be made of black metal like the door
that led to it. The walls were black, the floor was black. The
ceiling above was black, but for a single globe of crystal that
hung down from the ceiling on a white chain, and shone with a
brilliant silver light that looked like it had been cast in
imitation of Patronus light, though you could tell it wasn't the
real thing.</p>
<p>Within the room were pedestals of black metal, each bearing a
moving picture, or an upright cylinder half-filled with some
faintly shining silver liquid, or a lone small object; a scorched
silver necklace, a crushed hat, an untouched golden wedding ring.
Many pedestals bore all three, the moving picture and the silver
liquid and the item. There seemed to be a good many wizards' wands
upon those pedestals, and many of those wands were broken, or
burned, or looked like the wood had somehow melted.</p>
<p>It took that long for Harry to realize what he was seeing, and
then his throat suddenly choked; it was like the rage inside him
had been hit a hammerblow, maybe the hardest hammerblow of his
entire existence.</p>
<p>"These are not all the fallen of all my wars," Albus Dumbledore
said. His back was to Harry, only his grey locks and yellowish
robes showed. "Not even nearly all of them. Only my closest
friends, and those who died of my worst decisions, there is
something of them here. Those I regret most of all, this is their
place."</p>
<p>Harry couldn't count how many pedestals were in the room. It
might have been around a hundred. The room of black metal was not
small, and there was clearly more space left in it for future
pedestals.</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore turned and regarded Harry, the deep blue eyes
set like steel in his brow, but his voice, when he spoke, was calm.
"It seems to me that you know nothing of the phoenix's price,"
Albus Dumbledore said quietly. "It seems to me that you are not an
evil person, but most terribly ignorant, and confident in your
ignorance; as I once was, a long time ago. Yet I have never heard
Fawkes so clearly as you seemed to, that day. Perhaps I was already
too old and full of grief, when my phoenix came to me. If there is
something I do not understand, about how ready I should be to
fight, then tell me of this wisdom." There was no anger in the old
wizard's voice; the impact that drove out your breath like falling
off a broomstick was all in the scorched and shattered wands,
gleaming gently in their death beneath the silver light. "Or else
turn and go from this place, but then I wish to hear no more of
it."</p>
<p>Harry didn't know what to say. There had been nothing in his own
life that was like this, and all the words seemed to fall away. He
would find something to say if he looked, but he couldn't believe,
in that moment, that the words would be meaningful. You shouldn't
be able to win any possible argument, just from people having died
of your decisions, and yet even knowing that it felt like there was
nothing to be said. That there was nothing Harry had any right to
say.</p>
<p>And Harry almost did turn and go from that place, except for the
understanding which came to him then: that there was probably a
part of Albus Dumbledore which always stood in this place, always,
no matter where he was. And that if you stood in a place like this
you could do anything, <em>lose</em> anything, if it meant that you
didn't have to fight another time.</p>
<p>One of the pedestals caught Harry's eye; the photograph on it
did not move, did not smile or wave, it was a Muggle photograph of
a woman looking seriously at the camera, her brown hair twisted
into braids of an ordinary Muggle style that Harry hadn't seen on
any witch. There was a cylinder of silvery liquid beside the
photograph, but no object; no melted ring or broken wand.</p>
<p>Harry walked forward, slowly, until he stood before the
pedestal. "Who was she?" Harry said, his voice sounding strange in
his own ears.</p>
<p>"Her name was Tricia Glasswell," said Dumbledore. "The mother of
a Muggleborn daughter, who the Death Eaters killed. She was a
detective of the Muggle government, and after that she fed
information from the Muggle authorities to the Order of the
Phoenix, until she was - betrayed - into the hands of Voldemort."
There was a catch in the old wizard's voice. "She did not die well,
Harry."</p>
<p>"Did she save lives?" Harry said.</p>
<p>"Yes," the wizard said quietly. "She did."</p>
<p>Harry lifted his gaze from the pedestal to look at Dumbledore.
"Would the world be a better place if she hadn't fought?"</p>
<p>"No, it would not," said the old wizard. His voice was tired,
and grieving. He seemed more bent now, as though he were folding in
on himself. "I see that you still do not understand. I think you
will not understand until the day that you - oh, Harry. So very
long ago, when I was not much older than you are now, I learned the
true face of violence, and its cost. To fill the air with deadly
curses - for any reason - for <em>any</em> reason, Harry - it is an
ill thing, and its nature is corrupted, as terrible as the darkest
rituals. Violence, once begun, becomes like a Lethifold that
strikes at any life near it. I... would spare you that lesson the
way I learned it, Harry."</p>
<p>Harry looked away from the blue eyes, cast his gaze down at the
black metal of the floor. The Headmaster was trying to tell him
something important, that was clear; and it wasn't something that
Harry thought was stupid, either.</p>
<p>"There was a Muggle once named Mohandas Gandhi," Harry said to
the floor. "He thought the government of Muggle Britain shouldn't
rule over his country. And he refused to fight. He convinced his
whole country not to fight. Instead he told his people to walk up
to the British soldiers and let themselves be struck down, without
resisting, and when Britain couldn't stand doing that any more, we
freed his country. I thought it was a very beautiful thing, when I
read about it, I thought it was something higher than all the wars
that anyone had ever fought with guns or swords. That they'd really
done that, and that it had <em>actually worked.</em>" Harry drew
another breath. "Only then I found out that Gandhi told his people,
during World War II, that if the Nazis invaded they should use
nonviolent resistance against them, too. But the Nazis would've
just shot everyone in sight. And maybe Winston Churchill always
felt that there should've been a better way, some clever way to win
without having to hurt anyone; but he never found it, and so he had
to fight." Harry looked up at the Headmaster, who was staring at
him. "Winston Churchill was the one who tried to convince the
British government <em>not</em> to give Czechoslovakia to Hitler in
exchange for a peace treaty, that they should fight right away
-"</p>
<p>"I recognize the name, Harry," said Dumbledore. The old wizard's
lips twitched upward. "Although honesty compels me to say that dear
Winston was never one for pangs of conscience, even after a dozen
shots of Firewhiskey."</p>
<p>"The point is," Harry said, after a brief pause to remember
exactly who he was talking to, and fight down the suddenly
returning sense that he was an ignorant child gone insane with
audacity who had no right to be in this room and no right to
question Albus Dumbledore about anything, "the point is, saying
violence is evil isn't an <em>answer.</em> It doesn't say when to
fight and when not to fight. It's a hard question and Gandhi
refused to deal with it, and that's why I lost some of my respect
for him."</p>
<p>"And your own answer, Harry?" Dumbledore said quietly.</p>
<p>"One answer is that you shouldn't ever use violence except to
stop violence," Harry said. "You shouldn't risk anyone's life
except to save even more lives. It <em>sounds</em> good when you
say it like that. Only the problem is that if a police officer sees
a burglar robbing a house, the police officer <em>should</em> try
to stop the burglar, even though the burglar might fight back and
someone might get hurt or even killed. Even if the burglar is only
trying to steal jewelry, which is just a <em>thing.</em> Because if
nobody so much as <em>inconveniences</em> burglars, there will be
<em>more</em> burglars, and <em>more</em> burglars. And even if
they only ever stole <em>things</em> each time, it would - the
fabric of society -" Harry stopped. His thoughts weren't as ordered
as they usually pretended to be, in this room. He should have been
able to give some perfectly logical exposition in terms of game
theory, should have at least been able to <em>see</em> it that way,
but it was eluding him. Hawks and doves - "Don't you see, if evil
people are willing to risk violence to get what they want, and good
people always back down because violence is too terrible to risk,
it's - it's not a good society to live in, Headmaster! Don't you
realize what all this bullying is doing to Hogwarts, to Slytherin
House most of all?"</p>
<p>"<em>War</em> is too terrible to risk," the old wizard said.
"And yet it will come. Voldemort is returning. The black
chesspieces are gathering. Severus is one of the most important
pieces our own side possesses, in that war. But our evil Potions
Master must, as the saying goes, keep up appearances. If Severus
can pay that keep by hurting the feelings of children, only their
feelings, Harry," the old wizard's voice was very soft, "you would
have to be most terribly innocent in the ways of war, to think he
had made a poor bargain. Hard decisions do not look like
<em>that</em>, Harry. They look - like this." The old wizard did
not gesture. He simply stood where he was, among the pedestals.</p>
<p>"You shouldn't be Headmaster," Harry said through the burning in
his throat. "I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, but you shouldn't try to be a
school principal and run a war at the same time. Hogwarts shouldn't
be part of this."</p>
<p>"The children will survive," the old wizard said with tired old
eyes. "They would not survive Voldemort. Have you wondered why the
children of Hogwarts do not speak much of their parents, Harry? It
is because there is always, within earshot, someone who has lost
their mother or father or both. That is what Voldemort left behind,
the last time he came. <em>Nothing</em> is worth that war beginning
again even one day earlier than it must, or lasting one day longer
than it must." The old wizard did gesture now, as though to
indicate all the shattered wands. "We did not fight because it
seemed righteous to do so! We fought when we had to, when there was
no other way left. That was our answer."</p>
<p>"Is that why you waited so long to confront Grindelwald?"</p>
<p>Harry had uttered the question without quite thinking -</p>
<p>There was a slow time while the blue eyes searched him.</p>
<p>"Who have you been talking to, Harry?" said the old wizard. "No,
do not answer. I already know." Dumbledore sighed. "Many have asked
me that question, and always I have turned them aside. Yet in time
you must learn the full truth of that matter. Will you swear never
to speak of it to another, until I give you leave?"</p>
<p>Harry would have liked to be allowed to tell Draco, but - "I
swear," Harry said.</p>
<p>"Grindelwald possessed an ancient and terrible device," said
Dumbledore. "While he held it, I could not break his defense. In
our duel I could not win, only fight him for long hours until he
fell in exhaustion; and I would have died of it afterward, if not
for Fawkes. But while his Muggle allies yet made blood sacrifice to
sustain him, Grindelwald would <em>not</em> have fallen. He was,
during that time, truly invincible. Of that grim device which
Grindelwald held, none must know, none must suspect, there must be
not a single hint. And therefore you must not speak of it, and I
will say no more for now. That is all, Harry. There is no moral to
it, and no wisdom. That is all there is."</p>
<p>Harry slowly nodded. It wasn't entirely implausible, by the
standards of magic...</p>
<p>"And then," Dumbledore's voice went on, even quieter, almost as
though he were speaking to himself, "since it was I who felled him,
they obeyed me when I said he should not die, though they cried by
the thousands for his blood. So he was imprisoned in Nurmengard, in
the prison that he built, and he abides there until this day. I
went to that duel without any intent to kill him, Harry. Because,
you see, I had tried to kill Grindelwald once before, a long time
ago, and that... that was... it proved to be... a mistake,
Harry..." The old wizard was staring now at his long dark-grey wand
where he held it in both hands, as though it were a crystal ball
out of Muggle fantasy, a scrying pool within which answers could be
found. "And I thought, then... I thought that I should never kill.
And then came Voldemort."</p>
<p>The old wizard looked back up at Harry, and said, in a hoarse
voice, "He is not like Grindelwald, Harry. There is nothing human
left in him. <em>Him</em> you must destroy. You must not hesitate,
when the time comes. To him alone, of all the creatures in this
world, you must show no mercy; and when you are done you must
forget it, forget that you ever did such a thing, and go back to
living. Save your fury for that, and that alone."</p>
<p>In that office there was silence.</p>
<p>It lasted for some many long seconds, and finally was broken by
a single question.</p>
<p>"Are there Dementors in Nurmengard?"</p>
<p>"What?" said the old wizard. "No! I would not have done that
even to him -"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The old wizard stared at the young boy, who had straightened,
and his face changed.</p>
<p>"In other words," the boy said, as though talking to himself
without any other people in the room, "it's already known how to
keep powerful Dark Wizards in prison, without using Dementors.
People <em>know</em> they know that."</p>
<p>"Harry...?"</p>
<p>"No," the boy said. The boy looked up, and his eyes were blazing
like green fire. "I do not accept your answer, Headmaster. Fawkes
gave me a mission, and I know now why Fawkes gave that mission to
me, and not to you. You are willing to accept balances of power
where the bad guys end up winning. I am not."</p>
<p>"That too is not an answer," the old wizard said; his face
showed nothing of his hurt, he had long practice in concealing
pain. "Refusing to accept something does not change it. I wonder
now if you are simply too young to understand this matter, Harry,
despite your outward airs; only in children's fantasies can all
battles be won, and not a single evil tolerated."</p>
<p>"And that's why I can destroy Dementors and you can't," said the
boy. "Because I believe that the darkness can be broken."</p>
<p>The old wizard's breath stopped in his throat.</p>
<p>"The phoenix's price isn't inevitable," the boy said. "It's not
part of some deep balance built into the universe. It's just the
parts of the problem where you haven't figured out yet how to
cheat."</p>
<p>The old wizard's lips parted, and no words came forth.</p>
<p>Silver light falling on shattered wands.</p>
<p>"Fawkes gave me a mission," the boy repeated, "and I will carry
out that mission if I must break the entire Ministry to do it.
That's the part of the answer that you're missing. You don't stop
and say, <em>oh well, guess I can't possibly figure out any way to
stop bullying in Hogwarts,</em> and <em>leave</em> it at that. You
just keep looking until you figure out how to do it. If that
requires breaking Lucius Malfoy's entire conspiracy,
<em>fine.</em>"</p>
<p>"And the true fight, the fight against Voldemort?" the old
wizard said in an unsteady voice. "What will you do to win
<em>that</em>, Harry? Will you break the whole world? Even if
someday you gain such power, you are not yet beyond prices, and
perhaps you never will be! For you to act this way <em>now</em> is
nothing short of madness!"</p>
<p>"I asked Professor Quirrell why he'd laughed," the boy said
evenly, "after he awarded Hermione those hundred points. And
Professor Quirrell said, these aren't his exact words, but it's
pretty much what he said, that he'd found it tremendously amusing
that the great and good Albus Dumbledore had been sitting there
doing nothing as this poor innocent girl begged for help, while
<em>he</em> had been the one to defend her. And he told me then
that by the time good and moral people were done tying themselves
up in knots, what they usually did was nothing; or, if they did
act, you could hardly tell them apart from the people called bad.
Whereas <em>he</em> could help innocent girls any time he felt like
it, because he wasn't a good person. And that I ought to remember
that, any time I considered growing up to be good."</p>
<p>The old wizard did not show the force of the blow. Only a slight
widening of his eyes would have betrayed it, if you had been
watching him very closely.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, Headmaster," said the boy. "I haven't gotten my
wires crossed. I know that I'm supposed to learn goodness from
Hermione and Fawkes, not from Professor Quirrell and you. Which
brings me to the actual reason why I came here. Hermione's time is
too valuable to waste in detentions. Professor Snape will revoke
it, claiming that I blackmailed him."</p>
<p>After a hesitation the old wizard nodded his head, the silver
beard swaying slowly beneath. "That would not be best for
<em>her,</em> Harry," the old wizard said. "But the detention can
be put down as being served with Professor Binns, and you and she
can study together in his classroom."</p>
<p>"Fine," the boy said. "I think that was all the business we had
together, in the end. You may expect, the next time you seem to be
working on the side of the bad guys or letting them win, that I
will do whatever I think Fawkes would tell me to, regardless of how
much trouble comes of it. I hope we're both clear on that."</p>
<p>Without another word, the boy turned and walked out of the room,
through the open door of black metal, the words "<em>Lumos!</em> "
and the light of his wand following a moment later.</p>
<p>The old wizard stood there silent, silent amid the ruins of the
lives which his own life had left behind. His wrinkled hand rose,
shaking, to touch at his half-moon glasses -</p>
<p>The boy poked his head back in. "Would you mind switching on the
stairs, Headmaster? I'd rather not go through all the work again to
leave the same way I came."</p>
<p>"Go, Harry Potter," the old wizard said. "The stairs will
receive you."</p>
<p>(Some time later, an earlier version of Harry, who had invisibly
waited next to the gargoyles since 9PM, followed the Deputy
Headmistress through the opening that parted for her, stood quietly
behind her on the turning stairs until they came to the top, and
then, still under the Cloak, spun his Time-Turner thrice.)</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Aftermath: Professor Quirrell and -</em></p>
<p>In a shadowy clearing the Defense Professor waited, his back
leaned negligently against the rough grey bark of a towering beech
tree as yet unleaved in the late March days, so that its trunk and
crown seemed like a pale arm reaching up from the ground and
exploding into a hand of a thousand fingers. Around the Defense
Professor and above him were branches so dense that even in the
earliest spring, with few trees so much as budding, you could have
hardly seen the sky from the ground. The strands of the wooden net
crossed and proliferated so many times that if you were on a
broomstick above, searching for someone below, you would have found
it easier to follow your ears than your eyes. Nor would it have
helped that it was almost dark amid the prohibited woods, the
unseen sun almost set, so that only a few glows of fading sunlight
illuminated the tops of the tallest trees.</p>
<p>Then came the faintest sound of footsteps, almost inaudible even
on the forest ground; the gait of a man accustomed to passing
unseen. No twig snapped, nor leaf rustled -</p>
<p>"Good afternoon," said Professor Quirrell. The Defense Professor
did not trouble to move his eyes, or his hands from where they
rested negligently at his side.</p>
<p>A figure clad in a black cloak shimmered into existence, his
head turning to look left and then right. In the figure's right
hand, gripped low, was a wand of wood so grey it was almost
silver.</p>
<p>"I do not know why you wished to meet <em>here</em> of all
places," said Severus Snape, his voice cool.</p>
<p>"Oh," Professor Quirrell said idly, as though the whole matter
was of the least importance, "I thought you would prefer privacy.
The walls of Hogwarts have ears, and you would not wish the
Headmaster to know of your role in yesterday's affair, would
you?"</p>
<p>The March chill seemed to grow deeper, the temperature further
fall. "I don't know what you're talking about," the Potions Master
said icily.</p>
<p>"You know perfectly well what we're talking about," said
Professor Quirrell in an amused voice. "Really, my good Professor,
you should not meddle in the affairs of idiots unless you are ready
to defend yourself upon the instant from all their violence." (The
Defense Professor's hands still lay relaxed and open at his side.)
"And yet none of those idiots seem to remember the sight of you
falling, nor do the young ladies recall your presence. Which raises
the fascinating question of why you would go to the extraordinary
length, I dare say the <em>desperate</em> length, of casting
<em>fifty-two</em> Memory Charms." Professor Quirrell tilted his
head. "Would you fear so much the opinions of mere students? I
think not. Would you dread the matter becoming known to your good
friend, Lord Malfoy? But those fools, upon the very spot, invented
a quite satisfactory excuse for your presence. No, there is only
one person who holds so much power over you, and who would be most
perturbed to find you executing any plot without his knowledge.
Your true and hidden master, Albus Dumbledore."</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " hissed the Potions Master, the anger plain
upon his face.</p>
<p>"But now, it seems, you are moving on your own; and so I find
myself most intrigued as to what you could <em>possibly</em> be
doing, and why." The Defense Professor regarded the black-clad
silhouette of the Potions Master with the scrutiny a man might give
an exceptionally interesting bug, even if it was still ultimately
just a bug.</p>
<p>"I am no servant of Dumbledore's," the Potions Master said
coldly.</p>
<p>"Really? What astonishing news." The Defense Professor smiled
slightly. "Do tell me all about it."</p>
<p>There was a long pause. From some tree an owl hooted, the sound
huge in the silence; neither man startled or flinched.</p>
<p>"You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell," Severus Snape said,
his voice very soft.</p>
<p>"I don't?" said Professor Quirrell. "How would you know?"</p>
<p>"On the other hand," the Potions Master continued, voice still
soft, "my friends enjoy many advantages."</p>
<p>The man leaning against the grey bark raised his eyebrows. "Such
as?"</p>
<p>"There is much that I know of this school," said the Potions
Master. "Things you might not think I knew."</p>
<p>There was an expectant pause.</p>
<p>"How incredibly fascinating," said Professor Quirrell. The man
was examining his fingernails with a bored look. "Do go on."</p>
<p>"I know you have been... <em>investigating...</em> the
third-floor corridor -"</p>
<p>"You know nothing of the sort." The man's back straightened
against the wood. "Do not bluff against me, Severus Snape; I find
it annoying, and you are in no position to annoy me. A single
glance would tell any competent wizard that the Headmaster has
laced that corridor with a ridiculous quantity of wards and webs,
triggers and tripsigns. And more: there are Charms laid there of
ancient power, magical constructs of which I have heard not even
rumors, techniques that must have been disgorged from the hoarded
lore of Flamel himself. Even He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named would have
had trouble passing those without notice." Professor Quirrell
tapped a thoughtful finger on his cheek. "And for the actual lock,
a <em>Colloportus</em> laid on an ordinary doorknob, cast so weakly
that it could not have kept out Miss Granger on the day she entered
Hogwarts. Never before in my existence have I encountered such a
blatant trap." Now the Defense Professor narrowed his eyes. "I know
of no one left in the world against whom such fantastic feats of
detection would serve any useful purpose. If there is some wizard
possessed of ancient lore, of whom I know nothing, against whom
this trap is set - you may trade <em>that</em> information for as
much silence as you like, my dear Professor, and a good serving of
my favor left over afterward."</p>
<p>You could have sworn that Professor Quirrell was watching
Severus Snape with keen interest. Not the faintest trace of a smile
crossed the man's lips.</p>
<p>There was another long silence in the clearing.</p>
<p>"I do not know <em>who</em> Dumbledore fears," Snape said. "But
I know what bait he has set out, and somewhat of how it is truly
guarded -"</p>
<p>"As to that," said Professor Quirrell, sounding bored again, "I
stole it months ago, and left a fake in its place. But thank you
kindly for asking."</p>
<p>"You're lying," said Severus Snape after a pause.</p>
<p>"Yes, I am." Professor Quirrell leaned back against the grey
wood again, his eyes drifting up to the dense net of branches, the
falling night scarcely visible between the complex crossings. "I
simply wished to learn whether you would call me on it, since you
are pretending to know so little." The Defense Professor smiled to
himself.</p>
<p>The Potions Master looked like he was about to choke on his own
fury. "<em>What do you want?</em> "</p>
<p>"Nothing, really," said the Defense Professor, continuing to
gaze at the forest ceiling. "I was only curious. I suppose I shall
just watch and see where your plotting goes, and meanwhile I will
say nothing to the Headmaster - so long as you are willing to do me
a favor now and then, of course." A dry smile crossed the face.
"You are dismissed for now, Severus Snape. Though I wouldn't mind
having another little chat soon, if you're willing to speak with me
honestly of where your loyalties lie. And I do mean
<em>honestly,</em> not the false faces you've shown today. You
might find you have more allies than you thought. Take some time to
think it over, my friend."</p>

<p><em>Aftermath: Draco Malfoy and -</em></p>
<p>A rainbow hemisphere, a dome of solid force with little
chromaticity of its own which sent back the infringing light in
splintered reflections, iridescent in many colors, as it fractured
the shine of the many-splendored chandeliers of the Slytherin
common room.</p>
<p>Sheltered beneath the rainbow hemisphere, the terrified face of
a young witch who had never fought bullies, who had not joined any
of Professor Quirrell's armies, who was getting Acceptable marks at
best in her Defense class, who could not have cast a Prismatic
Barrier even to save her own life.</p>
<p>"Oh, stop it," said Draco Malfoy, making his voice sound bored
despite the sweat that had broken out underneath his robes, as he
kept his wand pointed at the barrier that was sheltering Millicent
Bulstrode.</p>
<p>He couldn't remember making the decision, there'd just been the
two older boys about to hex Millicent, the common room silently
staring, and then Draco's hand had just drawn his wand and cast the
barrier, leaving his heart to pump itself full of shocked
adrenaline while his poor sad brain frantically racked itself for
explanations -</p>
<p>The two older boys were straightening up from where they'd been
looming over Millicent, turning to Draco, looking at him with a
mixture of shock and anger. Gregory and Vincent beside him had
already drawn their own wands, but weren't pointing them. All three
of them together couldn't have won, anyway.</p>
<p>But the older boys wouldn't hex him. Nobody could possibly be
stupid enough to hex the next Lord Malfoy.</p>
<p>It wasn't fear of being hexed that was making Draco sweat
beneath his robes, as he desperately hoped the beads of water
weren't visible on his forehead.</p>
<p>Draco was sweating because of the dawning and sickening
certainty that even if he got away with this now, if he kept down
this path, there would come a time when it would all come crashing
down; and then he might not be the next Lord Malfoy anymore.</p>
<p>"Mr. Malfoy," said the oldest-looking boy. "Why are you
protecting her?"</p>
<p>"So you've located the mistress of the conspiracy," Draco said
with a Number Two Sneer, "and it's, let me get this straight now, a
first-year girl named Millicent Bulstrode. She's just a
<em>conduit</em>, you <em>niddlewit!</em> "</p>
<p>"So?" demanded the older boy. "She still helped them!"</p>
<p>Draco lifted his wand and the Prismatic Sphere winked out. Still
talking in a bored voice, Draco said, "<em>Did</em> you know what
you were doing, Miss Bulstrode?"</p>
<p>"N-no," Millicent stammered from where she was still sitting at
her desk.</p>
<p>"Did you know where the Slytherin messages you were passing on
were going to?"</p>
<p>"No!" said Millicent.</p>
<p>"Thank you," Draco said. "All of you please leave her alone,
she's just a pawn. Miss Bulstrode, you may consider the favor you
did me in February to have been repaid." And Draco turned back to
his Potions homework, hoping to Merlin and back again that
Millicent didn't say anything incredibly stupid like 'What favor?'
-</p>
<p>"Then why," a voice said clearly from across the room, "did
those witches go where a note from Millicent told them to go?"</p>
<p>Sweating even more, Draco lifted his head again to look at where
Randolph Lee had spoken. "What did the fake note say exactly?" said
Draco. "Was it, 'I command you to go forth in the name of the Dark
Lady Bulstrode' or 'Please meet me here, sincerely Millicent?'"</p>
<p>Randolph Lee opened his mouth, hesitated for a fractional second
-</p>
<p>"I thought so," said Draco. "That wasn't a very good test, Mr.
Lee, it - it can -" A frantic, nerve-racking moment while he
figured out how to say it without using Harry-words like <em>false
positive.</em> "It can get the witches to go there if any of them
is just <em>friends</em> with Millicent."</p>
<p>As though the matter had been entirely settled, Draco looked
down again at his Potions homework, ignoring (except for the
feeling of sick dread in his stomach) the whispers from around the
room.</p>
<p>It was only out of the corner of his eye that he caught Gregory
staring at him.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Draco's eyes rested on his Astronomy homework, but he couldn't
make his mind focus there. If you were trying not to think about
things Harry Potter had said, pretty much the worst possible thing
you could do was look at your textbook's pictures of the night sky,
and try to remember what you <em>weren't</em> supposed to know
about how the planets wandered. Astronomy, a noble and prestigious
art, a sign of learning and knowledge; only Muggles possessed
secret modern artifacts which could do it a million billion times
better using methods that Harry had tried to explain and which
Draco still couldn't begin to understand except that apparently it
didn't even take <em>magic</em> to make <em>things</em> do
<em>Arithmancy.</em></p>
<p>Draco looked at the pictures of constellations, and wondered if
it was like this in the other Houses, if people were always
threatening each other in Ravenclaw.</p>
<p>Harry Potter had told him once that soldiers on a battlefield
didn't really fight for their country. Patriotism might get them to
the battlefield in the first place, but once they were there, they
fought to protect <em>each other,</em> the friends they'd trained
with who were right in front of them. And Harry had observed, and
Draco had known that it was true, that you couldn't use loyalty to
a leader to power a Patronus Charm, it wasn't <em>quite</em> the
right kind of warm and happy thought. But thinking of protecting
someone beside you -</p>
<p>That, Harry Potter had said thoughtfully, was probably why the
Death Eaters had fallen apart the moment the Dark Lord had
departed. They hadn't been warm enough to <em>each other</em>.</p>
<p>You could recruit a group that included Bellatrix Black and
Amycus Carrow alongside Lord Malfoy and Mr. MacNair, and keep them
in line with the Cruciatus Curse. But the instant the master of the
Dark Mark was gone, you didn't have an army anymore, you had a
circle of acquaintances. That was why Father had failed. It hadn't
even really been his fault. There'd been nothing Father
<em>could</em> have done, after inheriting Death Eaters who weren't
really <em>friends</em> with each other.</p>
<p>And even though it was Slytherin House he was supposed to defend
- Slytherin House which he and Harry had formed a pact to
<em>save</em> - sometimes Draco couldn't help but think that it was
just less <em>wearisome</em> when he was leading army practices.
When he was working with students from the other three Houses that
weren't Slytherin. Once you saw and named the problems, you
couldn't <em>stop</em> seeing them, it just got more
<em>annoying</em> every day.</p>
<p>"Mr. Malfoy?" said the voice of Gregory Goyle, from where he was
lying on the floor beside Draco's desk, in the small but private
bedroom; Gregory was doing his Transfiguration homework, on which
he often needed help.</p>
<p>Any distraction was welcome at this point. "Yes?" said
Draco.</p>
<p>"You weren't really plotting against Granger at all," said
Gregory. "Were you?"</p>
<p>The sensation spreading through Draco's stomach felt just like
Gregory's voice sounded, sickened and afraid.</p>
<p>"You actually were helping Granger, that day you picked her up
off the floor," said Gregory. "And before, that time you kept her
from falling off the roof. You <em>helped</em> a <em>mudblood</em>
-"</p>
<p>"Yeah, right," said Draco sarcastically, without the slightest
hesitation or delay, looking back down at his Astronomy homework
like he wasn't the least bit nervous. It was all happening the way
Draco had feared it would, but at least that meant he'd played this
conversation in his head over and over, coming up with the right
opening gambit. "Come on, Gregory, you've dueled General Granger,
you <em>know</em> how strong her spells are. Like a real
Muggle-spawn is going to be more powerful than you, more powerful
than Theodore, more powerful than every single pureblood in our
whole school year except me? Don't you actually <em>believe</em> in
anything Father says? She's <em>adopted.</em> Her parents died in
the war and someone stuck her with a couple of Muggles to hide her.
No <em>way</em> is General Granger a real mudblood."</p>
<p>A slow pulse of silence through Draco's bedroom. Draco wanted to
know, needed to know what look was on Gregory's face. But he
<em>couldn't</em> look up from his desk, not yet, not until Gregory
spoke first.</p>
<p>And then -</p>
<p>"Is <em>that</em> what Harry Potter said to you?" said
Gregory.</p>
<p>The voice wavered, and broke. When Draco looked up from his
homework, he saw that tears were leaking out of Gregory's eyes.</p>
<p>Apparently that hadn't worked.</p>
<p>"I don't know what to do," Gregory said in a whisper. "I don't
know what to do now, Mr. Malfoy. Your father isn't - when he finds
out - he's not going to like it, Mr. Malfoy!"</p>
<p><em>It's not</em> your <em>job to decide what Father will like,
Goyle -</em></p>
<p>Draco could hear the words in his head; they sounded in Father's
voice, with the same sternness. It was the sort of thing Father had
<em>told</em> him to say, if Vincent or Gregory ever questioned
him; and if that didn't work he was to hex them. They were
<em>not</em> equal friends, Father had said, and he wasn't ever to
forget it. Draco was in charge, they were his servants, and if
Draco couldn't keep it that way then he wasn't fit to inherit House
Malfoy...</p>
<p>"It's all right, Gregory," Draco said, as gently as he could.
"All you've got to do is worry about protecting me. Nobody's going
to blame you for following my orders, not my father, not yours."
Putting all the warmth he could into his voice, like trying to cast
a Patronus Charm. "And anyway, the next war isn't going to be the
same as the last one. House Malfoy was around long before the Dark
Lord, and not every Lord Malfoy does the same thing. Father knows
that."</p>
<p>"Does he?" said Gregory in trembling voice. "Does he
<em>really?</em> "</p>
<p>Draco nodded. "Professor Quirrell knows it too," said Draco.
"That's what the armies are about. The Defense Professor's right,
when the next war comes, Father won't be able to unite the whole
country, they'll remember the <em>last</em> war. But anyone who's
fought in Professor Quirrell's armies will remember who the
strongest generals were, they'll know who's worthy to lead them.
They'll proclaim Harry Potter their Lord, and I'll be his right
hand, and House Malfoy will come out on top, like always. People
might even turn to <em>me,</em> if Potter isn't there, so long as
they think I'm trustworthy. That's what I'm setting up now. Father
will understand."</p>
<p>Gregory reached up and wiped his eyes, looking down again at his
Transfiguration homework. "Okay," Gregory said in a shaky voice.
"If you say so, Mr. Malfoy."</p>
<p>Draco nodded again, ignoring the hollow feeling inside himself
at the lies he'd just told his friend, and turned back to the
stars.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Aftermath: Hermione Granger and -</em></p>
<p>Being invisible should've been more <em>interesting</em> than
this, the corridors of Hogwarts should have been outlined in
strange colors or something. But actually, Hermione thought, being
under Harry's invisibility cloak was exactly like <em>not</em>
being under an invisibility cloak, except for the cloak part. When
you pulled the veil of soft black cloth down from the hood and over
your face, you couldn't even see it stretching in front of you, and
afterward it didn't seem to impede your breathing. And the world
looked just the same, except that when you walked past things of
metal, you didn't see any small reflections of yourself. Portraits
never looked at you, only did whatever strange things they did when
they were alone. Hermione hadn't tried walking past a mirror yet,
she wasn't sure she <em>wanted</em> to. Most of all, there was no
<em>you</em> anymore as you walked around, no hands, no feet, just
a changing point of view. It was an unnerving feeling, not so much
of being <em>invisible</em> as of <em>not existing.</em></p>
<p>Harry hadn't questioned her at all, she'd just got out the word
'invisibility' and then Harry was drawing his invisibility cloak
from his pouch. She hadn't even been given a chance to explain
about her extremely secret meeting with Daphne and Millicent
Bulstrode, or that she thought it would help protect the other
girls, Harry had just handed over what was probably a Deathly
Hallow. If you were fair, and she <em>did</em> try to be fair, she
had to admit that sometimes Harry could be a very true, true
friend.</p>
<p>The secret meeting itself had been a great big failure.</p>
<p>Millicent had claimed to be a seer.</p>
<p>Hermione had carefully explained to Millicent and Daphne at
considerable length that this could not possibly be true.</p>
<p>She and Harry had looked up Divination early on in their
research; Harry had insisted that they read everything they could
find about prophecies that wasn't in the Restricted Section. As
Harry had observed, it would save a lot of effort if they could
just get a seer to prophesy everything they would figure out
thirty-five years later. (Or to put it in Harry's terms, any means
of obtaining information transmitted from the distant future was
potentially an instant global victory condition.)</p>
<p>But, as Hermione had explained to Millicent, prophesying wasn't
controllable, there was no way to <em>ask</em> for a prophecy about
anything in particular. Instead (the books had said) there was a
sort of <em>pressure</em> that built up in Time, when some huge
event was trying to happen, or stop itself from happening. And
seers were like weak points that let out the pressure, when the
right listener was nearby. So prophecies were only about big,
important things, because only that generated enough pressure; and
you almost never got more than one seer saying the same thing,
because afterward the pressure was gone. And, as Hermione had
further explained to Millicent, the seers themselves didn't
remember their prophecies, because the message wasn't for
<em>them</em>. And the messages would come out in riddles, and only
someone who heard the prophecy in the seer's original voice would
hear all the meaning that was in the riddle. There was no
<em>possible</em> way that Millicent could just give out a prophecy
<em>any time she wanted</em>, about <em>school bullies</em>, and
then <em>remember</em> it, and if she <em>had</em> it would've come
out as 'the skeleton is the key' and not 'Susan Bones has to be
there'.</p>
<p>Millicent had been looking rather frightened at this point, so
Hermione had relaxed her fists where they'd been jammed on her
hips, calmed herself down, and stated carefully that she was glad
Millicent had helped them, but they <em>had</em> sometimes walked
into traps following what Millicent said, and so Hermione really
did want to know where the messages had <em>actually</em> come
from.</p>
<p>And Millicent had said in a small voice:</p>
<p><em>But, but she told</em> me <em>that she was a
seer...</em></p>
<p>Hermione had told Daphne not to press it, after Millicent had
refused to give up her source. It wasn't just that Hermione had
felt awful about the scared look on Millicent's face. It was that
Hermione had a strong feeling that if they <em>did</em> find the
person who'd been telling Millicent things, why, <em>they</em>
would turn out to just be finding envelopes under their pillow in
the morning.</p>
<p>She was getting that same despairing feeling she'd gotten in the
battle before Christmas, looking at Zabini's charts with all the
colored lines and boxes and... and she had only just now realized
what it meant that <em>Zabini</em> had been the one showing her
that chart.</p>
<p>Even for a Ravenclaw, she felt, there was such a thing as having
your life get overly complicated.</p>
<p>Hermione began ascending a short spiral of yellow marble steps
protruding from a central spine, a poorly-kept "secret" staircase
that was actually one of the fastest ways up from the Slytherin
dungeons to the Ravenclaw tower, but which only witches could
traverse. (Why girls in particular needed a quick way to move from
Ravenclaw to Slytherin and back was something Hermione found a bit
puzzling.) At the top of the staircase, now that she was away from
Slytherin places and back into the main parts of Hogwarts, Hermione
stopped and took off Harry's invisibility cloak.</p>
<p>After her pouch had swallowed the cloak, Hermione turned right
and started to walk down a short passageway, now automatically
keeping an eye out in all directions without really thinking about
it, and her constantly-scanning eyes glanced into a shadowy alcove
-</p>
<p><em>(fleeting disorientation)</em></p>
<p>- and then a rush of shock and fear hit her like a Stunning Hex
over her whole body, she found that without any thought or any
conscious decision her wand had leaped into her hand and was
already pointed at...</p>
<p>...a black cloak so wide and billowing that it was impossible to
determine whether the figure beneath was male or female, and atop
the cloak a broad-brimmed black hat; and a black mist seemed to
gather beneath it and obscure the face of whoever or whatever might
lie beneath.</p>
<p>"Hello again, Hermione," whispered a sibilant voice from beneath
the black hat, from behind the black mist.</p>
<p>Hermione's heart was already pounding hugely inside her chest,
her witch's robes felt already sweat-dampened against her skin,
there was a taste of fear already in her mouth; she didn't know why
she was so suddenly filled up with adrenaline but her hand gripped
harder on her wand. "Who are you?" Hermione demanded.</p>
<p>The hat tilted slightly; the whispery voice, when it came forth
from the black mist, sounded dry as dust. "The last ally," spoke
the sibilant whisper. "The one who finally answers, when no other
will answer you. I am perhaps the only <em>true</em> friend you
have in all Hogwarts, Hermione. For you have now seen how the
others stayed silent when you were in need -"</p>
<p>"What's your <em>name?</em> "</p>
<p>The black cloak rotated slightly, back and forth, it didn't
<em>look</em> like shoulders shrugging, but it conveyed a shrug.
"That is the riddle, young Ravenclaw. Until you solve it, you may
call me whatever you wish."</p>
<p>She could feel her palm already sweaty and was thankful for the
spiral grooves on her wand that helped her hand keep a steady grip
on the wood. "Well, Mister Incredibly Suspicious Person," Hermione
said, "what do you want with me?"</p>
<p>"That is the wrong question," came the whisper from black mist.
"You should ask, rather, what <em>I</em> can offer
<em>you</em>."</p>
<p>"No," the young girl said quite steadily, "I don't think I
<em>should</em> be asking that, actually."</p>
<p>A high-pitched chuckle from behind the black mist. "Not power,"
whispered the voice, "not wealth, you care little for such things,
do you, young Ravenclaw? <em>Knowledge</em>. That is what I
possess. I know what is unfolding within this school, all the
hidden plans and players, the answers of the riddle. I know the
true reason for the coldness you see in Harry Potter's eyes. I know
the true nature of Professor Quirrell's mysterious illness. I know
who Dumbledore truly fears."</p>
<p>"Good for you," said Hermione Granger. "But do you know how many
licks it takes to get to the Tootsie Roll center of a Tootsie
Pop?"</p>
<p>The black mist seemed to darken slightly, the voice sounded
lower when it spoke, disappointed. "So you are not even curious,
young Ravenclaw, about the truths behind the lies?"</p>
<p>"One hundred and eighty-seven," she said. "I tried it once and
that's how many it came out to." Her hand was almost slipping on
her wand, there was a sense of fatigue in her fingers like she'd
been holding the wand for hours instead of minutes -</p>
<p>The voice hissed, "Professor Snape is a hidden Death Eater."</p>
<p>Hermione almost dropped her wand.</p>
<p>"Ah," the voice whispered in satisfaction. "I thought that might
interest you. So, Hermione. Is there anything else you would like
to know about your enemies, or those you call friends?"</p>
<p>She stared up at the black mist that topped the towering black
cloak, frantically trying to order her thoughts. Professor Snape
was a Death Eater? Who would tell <em>her</em> something like that,
<em>why,</em> what was going <em>on?</em> "That's -" Hermione said.
Her voice was quavering. "That's extremely serious business, if
it's really true. Why are you telling something like that to
<em>me,</em> and not to Headmaster Dumbledore?"</p>
<p>"Dumbledore did nothing to stop Snape," the black mist
whispered. "You saw it, Hermione. The rot at Hogwarts begins at the
top. Everything that is wrong with this school, it all begins with
the mad Headmaster. You alone dared to call him out for it - and
therefore I speak to you."</p>
<p>"And have you also spoken to Harry Potter, then?" Hermoine said,
keeping her voice as even as she could. If <em>this</em> was his
helpful ghost -</p>
<p>The black mist darkened and lightened, like a shake of the head.
"I am frightened of Harry Potter," it whispered. "Of the coldness
in his eyes, of the darkness that grows behind them. Harry Potter
is a killer, and anyone who is an obstacle to him will die. Even
you, Hermione Granger, if you dare truly oppose him, the darkness
behind his eyes will reach out and destroy you. This I know."</p>
<p>"Then you don't know half of what you pretend to know," Hermione
said, her voice a little firmer. "I'm scared of Harry too. But not
because of what he might ever do to <em>me</em>. I'm scared of what
he might do to <em>protect</em> me -"</p>
<p>"Wrong." The whisper was flat, and hard, as if to brook no
possibility of denial. "Harry Potter <em>will</em> turn against you
in time, Hermione, when the darkness takes him fully. He will not
shed a tear, he will not even notice, on the day his footsteps
finally crush you underneath."</p>
<p>"<em>Double</em> wrong!" she said back in a rising voice, even
though there were chills going down her spine. One of Harry's
phrases came to her. "Just what do you think you know, and how do
you think you know it, anyway?"</p>
<p>"Time -" The voice seemed to catch itself. "Time enough for that
later. For now, for today, indeed Harry Potter is not your enemy.
And yet you are in gravest danger."</p>
<p>"I can believe <em>that</em>," said Hermione Granger. She
desperately wanted to shift her wand to her other hand, she felt
like she needed to grab her right arm just to keep it up, her head
ached like she'd been staring at the black mist for days; she
didn't know why she'd gotten tired so quickly.</p>
<p>"Lucius Malfoy has taken notice of you, Hermione." The whisper
had risen, departed from its tonelessness, taken on a note of
audible concern. "You have humiliated Slytherin House, you have
defeated his son in battle. Even before then you were an
embarrassment to all who stand with the Death Eaters; for you are a
Muggleborn and yet you possess a power of wizardry greater than any
pureblood. And now you are becoming known, the eyes of the world on
you. Lucius Malfoy seeks to crush you, Hermione, to hurt you and
perhaps even kill you, and he has the means to do it!" The whisper
had grown urgent.</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>"Is that all?" Hermione said. If she was ex-Colonel Zabini or
Harry Potter, she'd probably be asking clever questions to gather
more information; but her mind felt slow and fatigued. She really
needed to get out of here and go lie down for a while.</p>
<p>"You don't believe me," the whisper said, softer and sadder now.
"Why not, Hermione? I <em>am</em> trying to help you."</p>
<p>Hermione took a step backward, away from the shadowy alcove.</p>
<p>"<em>Why not, Hermione?</em> " demanded the voice, rising to a
hiss. "You owe me that much! Tell me, and then -" The voice caught,
and came back quieter. "And then you can go, I suppose. Only tell
me - <em>why</em> -"</p>
<p>Maybe she shouldn't've answered; maybe she should've just turned
and fled, or better yet, cast a Prismatic Wall first and then
screamed at the top of her lungs as she ran; but it was the note of
real pain in the voice that caught her, and so she answered.</p>
<p>"Because you look incredibly dark and scary and suspicious,"
Hermione said, keeping her voice polite, as her wand stayed level
on the towering black cloak and the faceless black mist.</p>
<p>"That's <em>all?</em> " whispered the voice incredulously.
Sadness seemed to infuse it. "I hoped for better from you,
Hermione. Surely such a Ravenclaw as you, the most intelligent
Ravenclaw to grace Hogwarts in a generation, knows that appearances
can be misleading."</p>
<p>"Oh, I know it," said Hermione. She took another step back, her
tired fingers tightening on the wand. "But the thing that people
forget sometimes, is that even though appearances <em>can</em> be
misleading, they're usually <em>not.</em>"</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>"You <em>are</em> the clever one," said the voice, and the black
mist evaporated away, no longer obscuring; she saw the face
beneath, and recognition sent a jolt of terrified adrenaline
bursting through her -</p>
<p><em>(fleeting disorientation)</em></p>
<p>- and then a rush of shock and fear hit her like a Stunning Hex
over her whole body, she found that without any thought or any
conscious decision her wand had leaped into her hand and was
already pointed at...</p>
<p>...a shining lady, her long white dress billowing about her as
though in invisible winds; neither her hands nor her feet were
visible, her face hidden beneath a white veil; and she was glowing
all over, not like a ghost, not transparent, just surrounded by
soft white light.</p>
<p>Hermione stared open-mouthed at the gentle sight, wondering why
her heart was already hammering, and why she felt so scared.</p>
<p>"Hello again, Hermione," the kindly whisper emanated from the
white glow behind the veil. "I've been sent to help you, so please
don't be afraid. I am your servant in all things; for you, my Lady,
are the bearer of a most marvelous destiny -"</p>

<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 78: Taboo Tradeoffs Prelude:
Cheating<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>It was Saturday, on the 4th of April, in the year 1992.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Davis looked rather nervous, as they sat in a
certain special section of the Hogwarts Quidditch stands - though
today the cushioned benches did not look upon flying broomsticks,
but rather viewed a gigantic square of something like parchment; a
great white blankness soon to flicker with windows into grass and
soldiers. For now it showed only the reflected dull gray color of
the surrounding overcast skies. (Looking rather stormy, though the
weather-wizards had promised that the rain wouldn't break before
nightfall.)</p>
<p>Ordinarily it was the ancient tradition of Hogwarts that mere
parents were to Stay Out - for much the same reason that impatient
children are told to get out of the kitchen and not meddle in the
cook's affairs. The only reason for a parent-teacher conference was
if a teacher felt that a parent wasn't shaping up properly. It took
an exceptional circumstance to make the Hogwarts administration
feel that it had to justify itself to <em>you.</em> On any given
occasion, generally speaking, the Hogwarts administration was
backed up by eight hundred years of distinguished history and you
were not.</p>
<p>Thus it had been with some trepidation that Mr. and Mrs. Davis
had insisted on an audience with Deputy Headmistress McGonagall. It
was hard to muster a proper sense of indignation when you were
confronting the same dignified witch who, twelve years and four
months earlier, had given both of you two weeks' detention after
catching you in the act of conceiving Tracey.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Mr. and Mrs. Davis's courage had been helped
by angrily waving about a copy of <em>The</em> <em>Quibbler</em>
whose headline showed, in bright bold text for all the world to
see:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">PACTS WITH POTTER?<br>
BONES, DAVIS, GRANGER<br>
IN LOVE RECTANGLE OF FEAR</p>
<p>And so Mr. and Mrs. Davis had argued their way into the Faculty
Box of the Hogwarts Quidditch stands, where they were now ensconced
with an excellent view of Professor Quirrell's enchanted screens,
so that the two of them could see for themselves "Just what the
Fiddly-Snocks has been going on in this school, if you'll pardon
the expression, Deputy Headmistress McGonagall!"</p>
<p>Seated to the left of Mr. Davis was another concerned parent, a
white-haired man in elegant black robes of unmatchable quality, one
Lucius Malfoy, political leader of the strongest faction of the
Wizengamot.</p>
<p>To the left of Lord Malfoy, a sneeringly aristocratic man with a
scarred face who had been introduced to them as Lord Jugson.</p>
<p>Then an elderly but sharp-eyed fellow named Charles Nott,
rumored to be nearly as wealthy as Lord Malfoy, seated on Lord
Jugson's left.</p>
<p>On the right of Mrs. Davis, one would find the comely Lady and
yet handsomer Lord of the Noble and Most Ancient House of
Greengrass. Young they were as wizards counted age, garbed in grey
silken robes set with tiny dark emeralds embroidered into the shape
of grass blades. The Lady Greengrass was considered a key swing
vote on the Wizengamot, her own mother having retired from the body
with surprising speed. Her charming husband, though his family was
not noble or wealthy of itself, had taken a seat on the Hogwarts
Board of Governors.</p>
<p>To their right, a square-jawed and incredibly tough-looking old
witch, who had shaken hands with Mr. and Mrs. Davis without the
slightest hint of condescension. This was Amelia Bones, Director of
the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.</p>
<p>To Amelia's right was a seniorish woman who had set the fashion
scene of magical Britain on its ear by integrating a live vulture
into her hat, one Augusta Longbottom. Though she was not addressed
as Lady, Madam Longbottom would exercise the full rights of the
Longbottom family for so long as their last scion had yet to attain
his majority, and she was considered a prominent figure in a
minority faction of the Wizengamot.</p>
<p>At the side of Madam Longbottom was seated none other than Chief
Warlock Supreme Mugwump Headmaster Albus Percival Wulfric Brian
Dumbledore, legendary defeater of Grindelwald, protector of
Britain, rediscoverer of the fabled twelve uses of dragon's blood,
the most powerful wizard in the world &amp;c.</p>
<p>And finally, on the far right, one would find the enigmatic
Defense Professor of Hogwarts, Quirinus Quirrell, who was leaning
back on the cushioned benches as though resting; seeming entirely
and naturally at ease in the rarefied company of a voting quorum of
the Hogwarts Board of Governors, which had dropped by on this fine
Saturday to learn just what the Fiddly-Snocks had been going on at
Hogwarts in general and with Draco Malfoy, Theodore Nott, Daphne
Greengrass, Susan Bones, and Neville Longbottom in particular. The
name of Harry Potter had also been much discussed.</p>
<p>Oh, and one mustn't forget Tracey Davis, of course. Director
Bones's eyebrows had climbed in some interest upon hearing the
young couple introduced as her parents. Lord Jugson had given them
a brief, incredulous stare before dismissing them with a snort.
Lucius Malfoy had greeted them politely, his smile containing a
hint of grim amusement mixed with pity.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Davis, whose last vote on anything of significance
had been touching their wands to the name of Minister Fudge, who
had all of three hundred Galleons stored in their Gringotts vault,
and who respectively worked at selling cauldrons in a Potions shop
and enchanting Omnioculars, were pressed up tightly against each
other, sitting rigidly erect upon their cushioned benches, and
desperately wishing they'd worn nicer robes.</p>
<p>The sky above was a solid mass of cloud dispersed into darker
and lighter grays, grim with the promise of future storms; though
no lightning flickered as yet, nor distant rumbles of thunder
echoed; and only a few threatening droplets had fallen.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>To their designated starting place in a certain forest, the
Sunshine Regiment marched, though it was really more like a slow
walk; you wouldn't want to tire yourself out before the battle even
started, and the breezes of April were annoyingly humid, though
cool. Ahead of them, a yellow flame wandered slowly through the
air, guiding them according to their pace.</p>
<p>Susan Bones kept throwing worried glances toward the Sunshine
General as they marched through the grayly illuminated forest.
Professor Snape's going after Hermione seemed to have really shaken
her. Hermione had even missed her Sunshine Regiment Official
Planning Meeting, which seemed understandable enough; but when
Susan had offered her sympathy afterward, Hermione had stammered
that she'd lost track of time, which wasn't at all a usual thing
for her to say, and the girl had looked exhausted and frightened
like she'd just spent three days locked in a bathroom stall with a
Dementor. Even now, when all the Sunshine General's focus should've
been on the coming battle, the Ravenclaw girl's gaze was constantly
darting in all directions, as though she expected Dark Wizards to
jump out of the bushes and sacrifice her.</p>
<p>"The ban on Muggle artifacts cuts down our options a lot,"
Anthony Goldstein was saying in the dour tones the boy used to
denote deliberate pessimism. "I had the idea of trying to
Transfigure nets to throw on people, but -"</p>
<p>"No good," said Ernie Macmillan. The Hufflepuff boy shook his
head, looking even more serious than Anthony. "I mean, it's just
like throwing a hex, they'd <em>dodge</em>."</p>
<p>Anthony nodded. "That's what I figured, too. Do you have any
ideas, Seamus?"</p>
<p>The former Chaotic Lieutenant still looked a bit nervous and
out-of-place, marching along with his new comrades in the Sunshine
Regiment. "Sorry," said the newly minted Captain Finnigan. "I'm
more the strategic master type."</p>
<p>"<em>I'm</em> the strategic master type," said Ron Weasley,
sounding put-off.</p>
<p>"There are <em>three</em> armies," the Sunshine General said
acerbically, "which means we fight <em>two</em> armies at once,
which means we need more than one strategist, which means shut up,
Ron!"</p>
<p>Ron gave their General a surprised and worried look. "Hey," the
Gryffindor boy said in a calming tone, "you shouldn't let Snape get
to you so much -"</p>
<p>"What do <em>you</em> think we ought to do, General?" Susan said
very loudly and quickly. "I mean, we don't really have a plan at
this point." Their official planning session had failed
<em>amazingly</em> with Hermione gone and both Ron and Anthony
thinking they were in charge.</p>
<p>"Do we really need a plan?" the Sunshine General said, sounding
a little distracted. "We've got you and me and Lavender and Parvati
and Hannah and Daphne and Ron and Ernie and Anthony <em>and</em>
Captain Finnigan."</p>
<p>"That -" began Anthony.</p>
<p>"Sounds like a pretty good strategy," Ron said with an approving
nod. "We've got as many strong soldiers now as both other armies
put together. Chaos's only got Potter and Longbottom and Nott left
- well, and Zabini too, I suppose -"</p>
<p>"And Tracey," said Hermione.</p>
<p>Several people swallowed nervously.</p>
<p>"Oh, stop it," Susan said sharply. "She's just a battle-hardened
member of S.P.H.E.W., that's all General Sunshine means."</p>
<p>"Still," Ernie said, turning to look seriously at Susan, "I
think you'd better go with whatever group fights Chaos, Captain
Bones. I know you can't use your double magical powers except when
innocents are in danger, but I mean - just in case Miss Davis
<em>does,</em> you know, go out of control and try to eat someone's
soul -"</p>
<p>"I can handle her," Susan told him, keeping her voice
reassuring. Admittedly, Susan hadn't been replaced by a
Metamorphmagus at the moment, but then Tracey probably wasn't
Polyjuiced Dumbledore or whoever.</p>
<p>Captain Finnigan intoned in a deep, sort-of-rumbling voice, "I
find your lack of skepticism disturbing." He raised his hand with
his thumb and forefinger almost touching, pointed at Ernie.</p>
<p>For some reason Anthony Goldstein seemed to be having a sudden
choking fit. "What's that supposed to mean?" said Ernie.</p>
<p>"It's just something General Potter says sometimes," said
Captain Finnigan. "Funny, when you first join the Chaos Legion it
all seems crazy, and then after a couple of months you realize that
actually everyone who <em>isn't</em> in the Chaos Legion is crazy
-"</p>
<p>"I <em>said</em>," Ron said loudly, "it sounds like good
strategy. We don't Transfigure anything, we don't tire ourselves
out, we handle whatever they throw at us, and then we just overrun
them."</p>
<p>"Okay," said Hermione. "Let's do that."</p>
<p>"But -" said Anthony, shooting a glare at Ron. "But General,
Harry Potter's got <em>sixteen</em> people left in his army. Dragon
and us each have twenty-eight. Harry knows that, he knows he's got
to come up with something incredible -"</p>
<p>"Like what?" demanded Hermione, sounding stressed. "If we don't
know what he's planning, we might as well save our magic for doing
massed <em>Finites.</em> Like we should've done <em>last</em>
time!"</p>
<p>Susan touched Hermione gently on the shoulder. "General
Granger?" said Susan. "I think you should take a break for a bit
before the battle."</p>
<p>She'd been expecting Hermione to argue, but Hermione just nodded
and then walked a little faster, pulling away from the Sunshine
Regiment Official Officer Group, her eyes still watching the
forest, and sometimes the sky.</p>
<p>Susan followed her. It wouldn't do, having it look like the
Sunshine General was being ejected from her own Official Officer
Group.</p>
<p>"Hermione?" Susan said softly, after they'd walked a bit away.
"You've got to focus. Professor Quirrell's in charge here, not
Snape, and he won't let anything bad happen to you or anyone."</p>
<p>"You're not helping," Hermione said, sounding shaky. "You're not
helping at all, Captain Bones."</p>
<p>The two of them walked faster, circling around some of the other
soldiers, inspecting the marching perimeter and glancing at the
surrounding trees.</p>
<p>"Susan?" Hermione said in a small voice, when they'd gotten
further away from all the others. "Do you think Daphne's right
about Draco Malfoy plotting something?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Susan said at once, not even thinking about it. "You can
tell, because his name's got the letters M-A-L-F-O and Y in
it."</p>
<p>Hermione looked around, as if to make sure that nobody was
watching, although of course that was a wonderful way to get other
people to pay attention to you. "Could Malfoy have been behind what
Snape did?"</p>
<p>"Snape could be behind Malfoy," Susan said thoughtfully,
remembering dinner-table conversations she'd heard at Auntie's, "or
Lucius Malfoy could be behind both of them." A slight chill went
down Susan's spine as this last thought occurred to her. Suddenly,
telling Hermione to just focus on the coming battle seemed a lot
less reasonable. "Why, did you find some sort of clue about
that?"</p>
<p>Hermione shook her head. "No," the Ravenclaw girl said, in a
voice that sounded almost like she was about to cry. "I was - just
thinking about it myself - that's all."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>In their designated place in a forest near Hogwarts, the Dragon
General and the warriors of Dragon Army waited where their red
flame had led them, beneath grey skies.</p>
<p>At Draco's right side stood Padma Patil, his second-in-command,
who had once led all of Dragon Army after Draco had been stunned.
At Draco's back was Vincent, the son of Crabbe, a family which had
served the Malfoys into the distance of forgotten memory; the
muscular boy was watchful as he was always watchful, whether battle
had been declared or no. Further back, Gregory of the Goyles stood
waiting beside one of the two broomsticks Dragon Army had been
given; if the Goyles had not served the Malfoys so long as the
Crabbes, yet they had served no less well.</p>
<p>And at Draco's left side, now, stood one Dean Thomas of
Gryffindor, a mudblood or possible half-blood who knew nothing of
his father.</p>
<p>Sending Dean Thomas to Dragon Army had been a quite deliberate
move on Harry's part, Draco was certain. Three other former
Chaotics had also been transferred to Dragon Army, and all were
watching Draco hawklike to see if he offered the former Lieutenant
the slightest insult.</p>
<p>Some might have called it sabotage, but Draco knew better. Harry
had also sent Lieutenant Finnigan to the Sunshine Regiment, even
though Professor Quirrell's mandate had only required that Harry
give up <em>one</em> Lieutenant. That too had been a deliberate
move, making crystal clear to everyone that Harry <em>wasn't</em>
dumping his least-favored soldiers.</p>
<p>In one sense, it might have been easier for Draco to win the
true loyalties of his new soldiers if they'd thought Harry hadn't
wanted them. In another sense... well, it wasn't easy to put into
words. Harry had given him good soldiers with their pride intact,
but it was more than that. Harry had showed kindliness toward his
soldiers, but it was more than <em>that</em>. It wasn't just Harry
playing fair, it was something that... that you couldn't help but
contrast with the way the game was played in Slytherin House.</p>
<p>So Draco hadn't offered the slightest insult to Mr. Thomas, but
brought him straight to his side, subordinate to himself and Padma
but no one else. It was a test, Draco had told Mr. Thomas and
everyone, not a promotion. Mr. Thomas would have to show himself
worthy of rank within Dragon Army - but he would be given a chance,
and the chance <em>would</em> be fair. Mr. Thomas had looked
surprised at the ceremony of it (the Chaos Legion, from what Draco
had heard, didn't stand on formality) but the Gryffindor boy had
stood a little straighter, and nodded.</p>
<p>And then, after Mr. Thomas had done well enough in one of Dragon
Army's training sessions, he'd been brought into the strategy
session in Dragon Army's huge military office. And a few minutes
into the session, Padma had happened to ask - as though it was a
perfectly normal question - whether Mr. Thomas had any ideas about
how to defeat the Chaos Legion.</p>
<p>The Gryffindor boy had said cheerfully that Harry had predicted
that General Malfoy would get one of his soldiers to ask him that,
and that Harry had given him the message that General Malfoy should
ask himself where his relative advantage lay - what Draco Malfoy
could do, or what Dragon Army could do, that the Chaos Legion
couldn't match - and then try to exploit it for all it was worth.
Dean Thomas couldn't think of what that advantage might be, but if
he <em>did</em> come up with any ideas for beating Chaos, he'd
share them. Harry had ordered him to, after all.</p>
<p><em>Sigh,</em> Draco had thought, since he couldn't actually
sigh out loud. But it was good advice, and Draco had followed it,
sitting at his bedroom desk with quill and parchment listing out
everything that might be a relative advantage.</p>
<p>And, almost to Draco's own surprise, he'd had an idea, a real
one. In fact he'd had <em>two.</em></p>
<p>The hollow bell sounded through the forest, somehow sounding
more ominous than ever before. On the instant, the two pilots cried
"<em>Up!</em> " and leapt onto their broomsticks, heading into the
gray sky.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Davis had now slumped slightly against each other,
more from sheer muscle exhaustion than from any decrease of
tension. Before them, the vast blank white parchment flickered with
three great windows, as though holes had been cut through into the
forest, showing three armies on the march. Lesser windows showed
the six riders upon their broomsticks, and the corner of the
parchment showed a view of the entire forest, with glowing dots to
indicate armies and scouts.</p>
<p>The window into Sunshine showed General Granger and her Captains
marching in the center of the Sunshine Regiment, protected by
<em>Contego</em> screens along with a number of other young
witches. The Sunshine Regiment, the Defense Professor had remarked,
knew well that it had now acquired a strong advantage in
experienced soldiers, and it meant to protect those soldiers from a
surprise attack. Aside from that, the Sunshine Soldiers were moving
forward at a steady march, conserving their strength.</p>
<p>The soldiers in General Malfoy's army, at least those with
higher Transfiguration scores, were picking up leaves and
Transfiguring them into... well, if you looked at Padma Patil, who
was almost done with hers, it looked like her leaf was becoming a
left-handed glove bearing a dangling strap. (The window had zoomed
in to show this.)</p>
<p>Lord Jugson was watching the screen with a flat expression; his
voice, when he spoke, seemed to ooze and drip with disdain. "What
<em>is</em> your son doing, Lucius?"</p>
<p>The foreign-born witch who stood at Draco Malfoy's right side
had finished Transfiguring her glove, and was now bringing it
before the Dragon General like a sacrifice.</p>
<p>"I do not know," said Lucius Malfoy, his tone calm though no
less aristocratic, "but I must trust that he has good reason for
doing it."</p>
<p>All Dragon Army stopped for a moment as Padma slid the glove
over her left hand, strapped it in place, and presented it before
Draco Malfoy; who also stopped in place, took several deep breaths,
raised his wand, executed a precise set of eight movements and
bellowed "<em>Colloportus!</em> "</p>
<p>The Dragon Warrior raised her gloved hand, flexed it, and gave a
small bow to Draco Malfoy, who returned it more shallowly, though
the Dragon General was staggering slightly. Padma then returned to
her place at Draco's side, and the Dragons began marching once
more.</p>
<p>"Well," remarked Augusta Longbottom. "I don't suppose someone
would care to explain?" Amelia Bones was frowning slightly as she
gazed at the screen.</p>
<p>"For some reason or other," said the amused voice of Professor
Quirrell, "it seems that the scion of Malfoy is able to cast
surprisingly strong magic for a first-year student. Due to the
purity of his blood, of course. Certainly the good Lord Malfoy
would not have openly flouted the underage magic laws by arranging
for his son to receive a wand before his acceptance into
Hogwarts."</p>
<p>"I suggest you be careful in your implications, Quirrell,"
Lucius Malfoy said coldly.</p>
<p>"Oh, I am," Professor Quirrell said. "A <em>Colloportus</em>
cannot be dispelled by <em>Finite Incantatem;</em> it requires an
<em>Alohomora</em> of equal strength. Until then, a glove so
Charmed will resist lesser material forces, deflect the Sleep Hex
and the Stunning Hex. And as neither Mr. Potter nor Miss Granger
can cast a counterspell powerful enough, that Charm is invincible
upon this battlefield. It is not the original intent of the Charm,
nor the intent of whoever taught Mr. Malfoy an emergency spell for
evading his enemies. But it would seem that Mr. Malfoy has been
learning creativity."</p>
<p>Lucius Malfoy had straightened as the Defense Professor spoke;
he now sat erect upon his cushioned bench, his head held
perceptibly higher than before, and when he spoke it was with quiet
pride. "He will be the greatest Lord Malfoy that has yet
lived."</p>
<p>"Faint praise," Augusta Longbottom said under her breath; Amelia
Bones chuckled, as did Mr. Davis for a tiny, fatal fraction of a
second before he stopped with a strangled gargle.</p>
<p>"I quite agree," said Professor Quirrell, though it wasn't clear
to whom he spoke. "Unfortunately for Mr. Malfoy, he is still new to
the art of creativity, and so he has committed a classic error of
Ravenclaw."</p>
<p>"And what might that be?" said Lucius Malfoy, his voice now
turned chill once more.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell had leaned back in his seat, the pale blue
eyes briefly unfocusing as one of the windows shifted its viewpoint
within the greater screen, zooming in to show the sweat now on
Draco Malfoy's forehead. "It is such a beautiful idea that Mr.
Malfoy has quite overlooked its pragmatic difficulties."</p>
<p>"Would someone care to explain that?" said Lady Greengrass. "Not
all of us present are experts at such... affairs."</p>
<p>Amelia Bones spoke, the old witch's voice somewhat dry. "It will
tempt them to try to catch hexes that they would be wiser to simply
dodge. The more so, if they have had little practice catching them.
And the casting of so many Charms will tire their strongest
warrior."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell gave the DMLE Director a half-nod of
acknowledgment. "As you say, Madam Bones. Mr. Malfoy is new to the
business of having ideas, and so when he has one, he becomes proud
of himself for having it. He has not yet had enough ideas to
unflinchingly discard those that are beautiful in some aspects and
impractical in others; he has not yet acquired confidence in his
own ability to think of better ideas as he requires them. What we
are seeing here is not Mr. Malfoy's best idea, I fear, but rather
his only idea."</p>
<p>Lord Malfoy simply turned to watch the screens again, as though
the Defense Professor had used up his right to exist.</p>
<p>"But -" said Lord Greengrass. "But what in Merlin's name is
Harry Potter -"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Sixteen remaining soldiers of the Chaos Legion - or fifteen plus
Blaise Zabini, rather - marched confidently through the forest,
their shoes thudding over the still-dry ground. Their camouflage
uniforms blended into the forest even more than usual, all colors
washed out by the tints of an overcast day.</p>
<p>Sixteen Chaos Legionnaires, against twenty-eight Dragon Warriors
and twenty-eight Sunshine Soldiers.</p>
<p>The common consensus had been that, with odds that bad, it was
practically impossible for them to lose. After all, General Chaos
was bound to come up with something really <em>spectacular,</em>
facing odds like that.</p>
<p>There was something almost nightmarish about how everyone seemed
to now expect Harry to pull miracles out of his hat, on demand, any
time one was needed. It meant that if you couldn't do the
impossible, you were <em>disappointing your friends</em> and
<em>failing to live up to your potential...</em></p>
<p>Harry hadn't bothered complaining to Professor Quirrell about
'too much pressure'. Harry's mental model of the Defense Professor
had predicted him looking severely annoyed, saying things along the
lines of <em>You are perfectly capable of solving this problem, Mr.
Potter; did you even try?</em> and then deducting several hundred
Quirrell points.</p>
<p>From above, from where two broomsticks watched their march, the
high young voice of Tess Walsh cried "Friend!" and after another
moment, "Gingersnap!"</p>
<p>A handful of seconds later, the soldier who'd code-named herself
Gingersnap returned bearing a double handful of acorns, sweating
slightly in the cool but humid air from the jog that had taken her
to the oak tree Neville had spotted. Gingersnap approached to where
Shannon was holding a uniform-shirt with the neck tied off, in lieu
of anyone having to Transfigure a bag. When Gingersnap brought her
hands forward to try and dump her acorns into the holding-shirt,
Chaotic Shannon, giggling, jerked the shirt to the right, then to
the left again as Gingersnap made another effort to dump the
acorns, until a sharp "Miss Friedman!" from Lieutenant Nott caused
Shannon to sigh and hold the shirt still. Gingersnap dumped her
acorns into those accumulated, and then headed out for more.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the background, Ellie Knight was singing her very
own version of the Chaos Legion's marching song, and around half
the other soldiers were trying to step along with it despite not
knowing the tune in advance. Nearby, Nita Berdine, who had a high
Transfiguration score, finished creating yet another pair of green
sunglasses, and handed them to Adam Beringer, who folded up the
sunglasses before tucking them into his uniform pocket. Other
soldiers were already wearing their own green sunglasses, despite
the cloudy day.</p>
<p>You might guess that there was some sort of incredibly
complicated and fascinating explanation behind this, and you would
be right.</p>
<p>Two days earlier Harry had been sitting amid his bookcases in
the comfy rocking-chair he'd obtained for his trunk's cavern level,
pondering silently in the quiet span between classes and
dinnertime, thinking about power.</p>
<p>For sixteen Chaotics to defeat twenty-eight Sunnies and
twenty-eight Dragons they would need a force amplifier. There were
limits to what you could do with maneuver. There <em>had</em> to be
a secret weapon and it had to be invincible, or at least moderately
unstoppable.</p>
<p>Muggle artifacts were now illegal in Hogwarts's mock battles,
banned by Ministry edict. And the trouble with finding some other
clever and unusual spell was that an army twice your own size could
brute-force <em>Finite</em> almost anything you tried. The Sunshine
Regiment might have missed that tactic with the Transfigured
chainmail, but nobody would miss it again now that Professor
Quirrell had pointed it out. And <em>Finite Incantatem</em> was a
brute-force counterspell which required at least as much magic as
the spell being canceled... which, if you were severely
outnumbered, made it a whole new order of military challenge. The
enemy could <em>Finite</em> anything you tried, and still have
enough magic left over for shields and volleys of Sleep Hexes.</p>
<p>Unless, somehow, you could invoke potencies beyond the ordinary
strength of first-year Hogwarts students, something too powerful
for the enemy to <em>Finite</em>.</p>
<p>So Harry had asked Neville if he'd ever heard of any <em>small,
safe</em> sacrificial rituals -</p>
<p>And then, after the screaming and the shouting had subsided,
after Harry had stopped trying to argue about Unbreakable Vows and
just given up the whole thing as impossible from a public relations
standpoint, Harry had realized that he hadn't even needed to go
there. They taught you how to invoke potencies far beyond your own
strength in ordinary Hogwarts classes.</p>
<p>Sometimes, even though you were looking straight at something,
you didn't realize <em>what</em> you were looking at until you
happened to ask exactly the right question.</p>
<p><em>Defense. Charms. Transfiguration. Potions. History of Magic.
Astronomy. Broomstick Flying. Herbology...</em></p>
<p>"<em>Foe!</em> " screamed the voice from above.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>It was a good thing that Neville Longbottom hadn't the tiniest
idea that his grandmother was watching; or he would've been more
self-conscious about screaming scary battlecries at the top of his
lungs while casting <em>Luminos</em> every three seconds as he
rocketed through a dense forest of trees, hot on the tail of
Gregory Goyle.</p>
<p>("But -" Augusta Longbottom said, her expression showing almost
as much astonishment as worry. "But Neville is afraid of
heights!")</p>
<p>("Not all fears last," said Amelia Bones. The old witch was
favoring the great screen before them with a measuring gaze. "Or
perhaps he has found courage. It is much the same, in the
end.")</p>
<p>A glimmer of red -</p>
<p>Neville dodged, very nearly into a tree but he did dodge; and
then Neville somehow also managed to dodge <em>almost</em> all of
the branches before they smacked him in the face.</p>
<p>Now Mr. Goyle's broomstick was pulling further and further away
- even though the two of them were riding exactly the same
broomstick and Mr. Goyle weighed more, somehow Neville was still
falling behind. So Neville slowed down, pulled back, angled up out
of the forest and began to accelerate back toward where the Chaos
Legion still marched.</p>
<p>Twenty seconds later - it hadn't been a long chase, just an
<em>exciting</em> one - Neville was back among his fellow Chaotics,
and dismounted his broom to walk on the ground for a little
bit.</p>
<p>"Neville -" said General Potter. Harry's voice was a little
distant, as he walked carefully and steadily through the forest,
his wand still applied to the almost-finished Form of the object he
was slowly Transfiguring. Beside him, Blaise Zabini, working a
smaller version of the same Transfiguration, looked like a
shambling Inferi as he stumbled forward. "I told you - Neville -
you don't have to -"</p>
<p>"Yes, I do," said Neville. He looked down at where his fingers
grasped the broomstick, and saw that not just his hands, but his
whole arms were shaking. But unless anyone else in Chaos had been
practicing dueling for an hour a day with Mr. Diggory, and then
practicing their aim in private for another hour afterward, Neville
was probably the best shot from a broomstick even after taking into
account that he wasn't a very good flyer.</p>
<p>"Good show, Neville," Theodore said from where he was walking
ahead of them all, leading the Chaos Legion forward through the
forest while wearing only his undershirt.</p>
<p>(Augusta Longbottom and Charles Nott exchanged brief astonished
glances and then wrenched their gazes away from one another as
though stung.)</p>
<p>Neville took a few deep breaths, trying to steady his hands,
trying to think; Harry might not be good for deep strategic
thinking while he was in the middle of an extended Transfiguration.
"Lieutenant Nott, do you have any idea why Dragon Army just did
that? They lost a broom -" The Dragons had started the combat with
a feint to provide a distraction for Mr. Goyle's approach through
the forest; Neville hadn't realized there were <em>two</em> brooms
attacking until almost too late. But the Chaos Legion had
<em>gotten</em> the other pilot. That was why broomsticks usually
didn't attack before armies met, it meant a whole army would
concentrate fire on the broomstick. "And the Dragons didn't even
get anyone, did they?"</p>
<p>"Nope!" Tracey Davis said proudly. She too was now marching by
General Potter's side, her wand gripped low and watchful as her
eyes scanned the surrounding forest. "I threw up a Prismatic Sphere
like a split second before Mr. Goyle's hex got Zabini, and the way
Mr. Goyle had his other arm stretched out I think he planned to
knock down the General, too." The Slytherin witch smiled with
vicious confidence. "Mr. Goyle tried a Breaking Drill Hex, but
learned to his dismay that his weak magic was no match for my
newfound dark powers, hahahaha!"</p>
<p>Some Chaotics laughed with her, but a queasy sensation was
starting in Neville's stomach as he realized how close the Chaos
Legion had come to complete disaster. If Mr. Goyle had managed to
disrupt both Transfigurations -</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"Report!" snapped the Dragon General, doing his best to conceal
the fatigue he felt after casting seventeen Locking Charms, with
more yet to come.</p>
<p>Beads of sweat now dotted Gregory's forehead. "The enemy got
Dylan Vaughan," Gregory said formally. "Harry Potter and Blaise
Zabini were each Transfiguring something dark-grey and roundish, I
don't think it was finished but it looked like it would be big and
hollow, sort of cauldron-shaped. Zabini's was smaller than
Potter's. I couldn't get either of them or disrupt their
Transfigurations, Tracey Davis blocked me. Neville Longbottom is on
a broomstick and he's still a terrible flyer but his aim is really
good."</p>
<p>Draco listened, frowning, and then he glanced at Padma and Dean
Thomas, who both shook their own heads, indicating that they also
couldn't think of what might be big and grey and shaped like a
cauldron.</p>
<p>"Anything else?" said Draco. If that was it, they'd lost a broom
for nothing -</p>
<p>"The only other weird thing I saw," Gregory said, sounding
puzzled, "was that some Chaotics were wearing... sort of like
goggles?"</p>
<p>Draco thought about this, not noticing that he'd stopped
marching or that all of Dragon Army had automatically stopped with
him.</p>
<p>"Was there anything special about the goggles?" Draco said.</p>
<p>"Um..." Gregory said. "They were... greenish, maybe?"</p>
<p>"Okay," said Draco. Again without thinking, he began walking
once more and his Dragons followed. "Here's our new strategy. We're
only going to send eleven Dragons against the Chaos Legion, not
fourteen. That should be enough to beat them, now that we can
neutralize their special advantage." It was a gamble, but you had
to take gambles sometimes, if you wanted to come in first in a
three-way battle.</p>
<p>"You figured out Chaos's plan, General Malfoy?" said Mr. Thomas
with considerable surprise.</p>
<p>"What are they doing?" said Padma.</p>
<p>"I haven't the faintest idea," said Draco, with a smirk of the
most refined smugness. "We'll just do the obvious thing."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry, having now finished his cauldron, was carefully scooping
acorns into the container while the scouts searched for a nearby
source of water that could be used as a liquid base. They'd come
across frequent sinkholes and miniature creeks in the forest
before, so it ought not to take long. Another scout had brought a
straight stick that would serve as a stirrer, so Harry didn't have
to Transfigure one.</p>
<p>Sometimes, even though you were looking straight at something,
you didn't realize <em>what</em> you were looking at until you
happened to ask exactly the right question...</p>
<p><em>How can I invoke magical powers that ought to be beyond the
reach of first-year students?</em></p>
<p>There was a cautionary tale the Potions Master had told them
(with much sneers and laughter to make the stupidity seem
low-status instead of daring and romantic) about a second-year
witch in Beauxbatons who'd stolen some extremely restricted and
expensive ingredients, and tried to brew Polyjuiceso she could
borrow the form of another girl for purposes better left
unmentioned. Only she'd managed to contaminate the potion with
<em>cat hairs,</em> and then instead of seeking a healer
immediately, the witch had hidden herself in a bathroom, hoping the
effects would just wear off; and when she'd finally been found, it
had been too late to reverse the transformation completely,
condemning her to a life of despair as a sort of cat-girl
hybrid.</p>
<p>Harry hadn't realized what that <em>meant</em> until the instant
of thinking the right question - but what that implied was that a
young wizard or witch could do things with Potions-Making that they
couldn't even come close to doing with Charms. Polyjuice was one of
the most potent potions known... but what made Polyjuice a
N.E.W.T.-level potion, apparently, wasn't the required age before
you had enough magical power; it was how difficult the potion was
to brew precisely and what happened to you if you screwed up.</p>
<p>Nobody in any army had tried brewing any potions up until then.
But Professor Quirrell would let you get away with nearly anything,
if it was something you could also have done in a real war.
<em>Cheating is technique,</em> the Defense Professor had once
lectured them. <em>Or rather, cheating is what the losers call
technique, and will be worth extra Quirrell points when executed
successfully.</em> In principle, there was nothing unrealistic
about Transfiguring a couple of cauldrons and brewing potions out
of whatever came to hand, if you had enough time before the armies
met.</p>
<p>So Harry had retrieved his copy of <em>Magical Drafts and
Potions,</em> and begun looking for a safe but useful potion he
could brew in the minutes before the battle started - a potion
which would win the battle too fast for counterspells, or produce
spell effects too strong for first-years to <em>Finite.</em></p>
<p>Sometimes, even though you were looking straight at something,
you didn't realize <em>what</em> you were looking at until you
happened to ask exactly the right question...</p>
<p><em>What potion can I brew using only components gathered from
an ordinary forest?</em></p>
<p>Every recipe in <em>Magical Drafts and Potions</em> used at
least one ingredient from a magical plant or animal. Which was
unfortunate, because all the <em>magical</em> plants and animals
were in the Forbidden Forest, not the safer and lesser woods where
battles were held.</p>
<p>Someone else might have given up at that point.</p>
<p>Harry had turned the pages from one recipe to another, skimming
faster and faster in dawning realization, confirming what he had
already read and was now <em>seeing</em> for the first time.</p>
<p>Every single Potions recipe seemed to demand at least one
magical ingredient, <em>but why should that be true?</em></p>
<p>Charms required no material components at all; you just said the
words and waved your wand. Harry had been thinking about
Potions-Making as essentially analogous: Instead of your spoken
syllables triggering a spell effect for no comprehensible reason,
you collected a batch of disgusting ingredients and stirred four
times clockwise, and that arbitrarily triggered a spell effect.</p>
<p>In which case, given that most potions used ordinary components
like porcupine quills or stewed slugs, you'd expect to see some
potions using <em>only</em> ordinary components.</p>
<p>But instead every single recipe in <em>Magical Drafts and
Potions</em> demanded at least <em>one</em> component from a
magical plant or animal - an ingredient like silk from an
Acromantula or petals from a Venus Fire Trap.</p>
<p>Sometimes, even though you were looking straight at something,
you didn't realize <em>what</em> you were looking at until you
happened to ask exactly the right question...</p>
<p><em>If making a potion is like casting a Charm, why don't I fall
over from exhaustion after brewing a draught as powerful as
boil-curing?</em></p>
<p>The Friday before last, Harry's double Potions class had brewed
<em>potion of boil-curing...</em> although even the most trivial
healing Charms, if you tried to cast them with wand and
incantation, were at least fourth-year spells. And afterward,
they'd all felt the way they usually felt after Potions class,
namely, <em>not</em> magically exhausted to any discernible
degree.</p>
<p>Harry had shut his copy of <em>Magical Drafts and Potions</em>
with a snap, and rushed down to the Ravenclaw common room. Harry
had found a seventh-year Ravenclaw doing his N.E.W.T. potions
homework and paid the older boy a Sickle to borrow <em>Moste
Potente Potions</em> for five minutes; because Harry hadn't wanted
to run all the way to the library to find confirmation.</p>
<p>After skimming through five recipes in the seventh-year book,
Harry had read the sixth recipe, for a <em>potion of fire
breathing</em>, which required Ashwinder eggs... and the book
warned that the resulting fire could be no hotter than the magical
fire which had spawned the Ashwinder which had laid the eggs.</p>
<p>Harry had shouted "<em>Eureka!</em> " right in the middle of the
Ravenclaw common room, and been severely rebuked by a nearby
prefect, who'd thought Mr. Potter was trying to cast a spell.
Nobody in the wizarding world knew or cared about some ancient
Muggle named Archimedes, nor the ur-physicist's realization that
the water displaced from a bathtub would equal the volume of the
object entering the bathtub...</p>
<p>Conservation laws. They'd been the critical insight in more
Muggle discoveries than Harry could easily count. In Muggle
technology you couldn't raise a feather one meter off the ground
without the power coming from <em>somewhere.</em> If you looked at
molten lava spilling from a volcano and asked where the heat came
from, a physicist would tell you about radioactive heavy metals in
the center of the Earth's molten core. If you asked where the
energy to power the radioactivity came from, the physicist would
point to an era before the Earth had formed, and a primordial
supernova in the early days of the galaxy which had baked atomic
nuclei heavier than the natural limit, the supernova compressing
protons and neutrons into a tight unstable package that yielded
back some of the supernova's energy when it split. A light bulb was
fueled by electricity, fueled by a nuclear power plant, fueled by a
supernova... You could play the game all the way back to the Big
Bang.</p>
<p>Magic did <em>not</em> appear to work like this, to put it
mildly. Magic's attitude toward laws like Conservation of Energy
was somewhere between a giant extended middle finger, and a shrug
of total indifference. <em>Aguamenti</em> created water out of
nothingness, so far as anyone knew; there was no known lake whose
water level went down each time. That was a simple fifth-year
spell, not considered impressive by wizards, because creating a
mere glass of water didn't seem amazing to them. They didn't have
the wacky notion that mass ought to be conserved, or that creating
a gram of mass was somehow equivalent to creating
90,000,000,000,000 joules of energy. There was an upper-year spell
Harry had run across whose <em>literal incantation</em> was
'<em>Arresto Momentum!'</em> and when Harry had asked if the
momentum went anywhere <em>else</em> he'd just gotten a puzzled
look. Harry had kept an increasingly desperate eye out for
<em>some</em> kind of conservation principle in magic, anywhere
whatsoever...</p>
<p>...and the whole time it had been right in front of him in every
Potions class. Potions-Making didn't <em>create</em> magic, it
<em>preserved</em> magic, that was why every potion needed at least
one magical ingredient. And by following instructions like 'stir
four times counterclockwise and once clockwise' - Harry had
hypothesized - you were doing something like casting a small spell
that reshaped the magic in the ingredients. (And unbound the
physical form so that ingredients like porcupine quills dissolved
smoothly into a drinkable liquid; Harry strongly suspected that a
Muggle following exactly the same recipe would end up with nothing
but a spiny mess.) That was what Potions-Making really
<em>was,</em> the art of transforming existing magical essences. So
you were a little tired after Potions class, but not much, because
you weren't empowering the potions yourself, you were just
reshaping magic that was already there. And that was why a
second-year witch could brew Polyjuice, or at least get close.</p>
<p>Harry had kept scanning through <em>Moste Potente Potions,</em>
looking for something that might disprove his shiny new theory.
After five minutes he'd flipped the older boy another Sickle (over
his protests) and kept going.</p>
<p>The <em>potion of giant strength</em> required a Re'em to
trample the mashed Dugbogs you stirred into the potion. It was odd,
Harry had realized after a moment, because crushed Dugbogs weren't
strong themselves, they were just... very, very crushed after the
Re'em got through with them.</p>
<p>Another recipe said to 'touch with forged bronze', i.e., grasp a
Knut in pliers so you could skim the potion's surface; and if you
dropped the Knut all the way in, the book warned, the potion would
instantly superheat and boil over the cauldron.</p>
<p>Harry had stared at the recipes and their warnings, forming a
second and stranger hypothesis. Of course it wouldn't be as simple
as Potions-Making using magical potentials imbued in the
ingredients, like Muggle cars fueled by the combustion potential of
gasoline. Magic would never be as sensible as that...</p>
<p>And then Harry had gone to Professor Flitwick - since he didn't
want to approach Professor Snape outside of class - and Harry had
told Professor Flitwick that he wanted to invent a new potion, and
he knew what the ingredients ought to be and what the potion should
do, but he didn't know how to deduce the required stirring pattern
-</p>
<p>After Professor Flitwick had stopped screaming in horror and
running in little circles, and Professor McGonagall had been called
into the ensuing fierce interrogation to promise Harry that in this
case it was both acceptable and important for him to reveal his
underlying theory, it had developed that Harry had not made an
original magical discovery, but rediscovered a law so ancient that
nobody knew who had first formulated it:</p>
<p><em>A potion spends that which is invested in the creation of
its ingredients.</em></p>
<p>The heat of goblin forges that had cast the bronze Knut, the
Re'em's strength that had crushed the Dugbogs, the magical fire
that had spawned the Ashwinder: all these potencies could be
recalled, unlocked, and restructured by the spell-like process of
stirring the ingredients in exact patterns.</p>
<p>(From a Muggle standpoint it was just <em>odd,</em> a deranged
version of thermodynamics invented by someone who thought life
ought to be <em>fair</em>. From a Muggle standpoint, the heat
expended in forging the Knut hadn't gone into the bronze, the heat
had left and dissipated into the environment, becoming permanently
less available. Energy was conserved, could be neither created nor
destroyed; <em>entropy</em> always increased. But wizards didn't
think that way: from their perspective, if you'd put some amount of
work into making a Knut, it stood to reason that you could get
exactly the same work back out. Harry had tried to explain why this
sounded a bit odd if you'd been raised by Muggles, and Professor
McGonagall had asked bemusedly why the Muggle perspective was any
better than the wizarding one.)</p>
<p>The fundamental principle of Potions-Making had no name and no
standard phrasing, since then you might be tempted to write it
down.</p>
<p>And someone who wasn't wise enough to figure out the principle
themselves might read it.</p>
<p>And they would start having all sorts of bright ideas for
inventing new Potions.</p>
<p>And then they would be turned into catgirls.</p>
<p>It had been made very clear to Harry that he wasn't going to be
sharing this particular discovery with Neville, or Hermione either
after the next armies' battle. Harry had tried to say something
about Hermione seeming really off lately and this being just the
sort of thing that might cheer her up. Professor McGonagall had
said flatly that he wasn't even to think it, and Professor Flitwick
had raised his little hands and made a gesture as of snapping a
wand in half.</p>
<p>Although the two Professors had been kind enough to suggest that
if Mr. Potter thought he knew what the potion's ingredients should
be, he might be able to find an already-existing recipe that did
the same thing; and Professor Flitwick had mentioned several
volumes in the Hogwarts library that might be useful...</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The vast parchment-like screen now showed only an aerial view of
the forest, from which you could barely make out the camouflaged
forms of three armies, split up into two groups each, converging to
fight their three-way battle.</p>
<p>The benches of the Quidditch stadium were now rapidly filling up
with the more easily bored sort of spectator who only wanted to be
there for the final battle and skip out on all the boring points
along the way. (If there was anything wrong with Professor
Quirrell's battles, it was widely agreed, it was that his
spectacles didn't last nearly as long as Quidditch matches, once
they actually started. To this Professor Quirrell had replied only,
<em>Such is realism,</em> and that had been that.)</p>
<p>Within the huge window - it was all one window now, observing
from a great height - the vague collections of tiny camouflaged
forms grew closer.</p>
<p>Closer.</p>
<p>Almost touching -</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The vast white parchment window showed the first touch of battle
between Sunshine and Chaos, a screaming mass of running children
with smiley-faces upon their breasts, charging forward with
<em>Contego</em> shields held high and others shouting
"<em>Somnium!</em> " -</p>
<p>Until one of their number shrieked "<em>Prismatis!</em> " in a
terrified voice and the entire charge came to a sudden halt before
the sparkling wall of force that had appeared in front of them.</p>
<p>Tracey Davis had walked out from behind the trees.</p>
<p>"That's right," said Tracey, her voice low and grim as she
leveled her wand on the barrier. "You should fear me. For I am
Tracey Davis, the Darke Lady! That's Darke Lady spelled D-A-R-K-E,
with an E!"</p>
<p>(Amelia Bones, Director of the Department of Magical Law
Enforcement, was sending an inquiring look at Mr. and Mrs. Davis,
both of whom looked like they would have dearly preferred to die on
the spot.)</p>
<p>Behind the Prismatic Barrier, there was some kind of hushed
argument taking place among the Sunshine Soldiers, one of whom in
particular seemed to be getting scolded by several of the
others.</p>
<p>Then, a moment later, <em>Tracey</em> flinched.</p>
<p>Susan Bones had come to the front of the Sunshine
contingent.</p>
<p>("Goodness," said Augusta Longbottom. "What <em>do</em> you
suppose your grand-niece has been learning at Hogwarts?")</p>
<p>("I don't know," Amelia Bones said calmly, "but I shall owl her
a Chocolate Frog and instructions to learn more of it.")</p>
<p>The Prismatic Barrier vanished.</p>
<p>The Sunshine Soldiers resumed their charge forward.</p>
<p>Tracey yelled, her voice high with strain,
"<em>Inflammare!</em> " and the Sunshine charge came to another
sudden halt as a line of fire blazed up between them in the
half-dry grass, extending to follow the path of Tracey's wand as
she pointed it; an instant later Susan Bones cried "<em>Finite
Incantatem!</em> " and the flames dimmed, brightened, dimmed in the
contest of their wills, other soldiers raising their wards to aim
at Tracey; and <em>that</em> was when Neville Longbottom plunged
shrieking out of the sky.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>One of the Dragon Warriors, Raymond Arnold, made a hand-sign,
pointing forward and oblique left; and there was a sudden hushed
hiss of whispers among the Dragon Army contingent as they all
quietly reoriented themselves in the direction of the enemy. The
Sunnies knew they were there, of course both armies knew; but
somehow, in this moment, they had all become instinctively
quiet.</p>
<p>The Dragons crept forward further, and then further, the dull
camouflaged forms of the Sunnies beginning to appear among the
distant trees, and still nobody spoke, nobody bellowed the call to
charge.</p>
<p>Draco was now at the forefront of his soldiers, Vincent behind
him and Padma only a shade further back; if the three of them could
take the shock of Sunshine's best, the rest of Dragon Army might
stand a chance.</p>
<p>Then Draco saw one Sunnie staring at him from the distance, in
the vanguard of her own army; staring at him with a look of fury
-</p>
<p>Across the forest battleground, their eyes met.</p>
<p>Draco had only a fraction of a second to wonder, in the back of
his mind, what Hermione Granger was so angry about, before the
shout went up from both their armies; and they were all running
forward to the charge.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The other Chaotics had appeared now from among the trees, some
had <em>dropped out</em> of trees, and the battle was in full force
now, everyone firing in every direction at anything that looked
like an enemy. Plus a number of Sunnies crying <em>"Luminos!</em> "
at Neville Longbottom as the Chaos Hufflepuff twisted and rocketed
up through the air on courses that could only be described as,
indeed, "chaotic" -</p>
<p>And it happened, the way it happened only one time out of twenty
in mock aerial combat, that Neville Longbottom's broomstick glowed
bright red beneath his clenched hands.</p>
<p>It should've meant that Longbottom was out of the game.</p>
<p>Then, in the Hogwarts stands, among the watching crowds of
students, a scream went up -</p>
<p><em>Combat realism.</em> It was Professor Quirrell's one master
rule. You could get away with anything if it was realistic, and in
real life, a soldier didn't just vanish when their
<em>broomstick</em> got hit by a curse.</p>
<p>Neville was falling toward the ground and screaming "<em>Chaotic
landing!</em> " and the Chaotics were wrenching their attention
away from fights to cast the Hover Charm (and run at the same time
so they wouldn't be sitting ducks), almost everyone else stopping
to gape -</p>
<p>And Neville Longbottom slammed into the leaf-laden forest
ground, landing on one knee, one foot, and both hands, as though he
were kneeling down to be knighted.</p>
<p>Everything stopped. Even Tracey and Susan paused in their
duel.</p>
<p>In the stadium, all crowd noises vanished.</p>
<p>There was a universal silence composed of astonishment, concern,
and sheer dumbstruck gaping awe, as everyone waited to see what
would happen next.</p>
<p>And then Neville Longbottom slowly rose to his feet, and leveled
his wand at the Sunshine Soldiers.</p>
<p>Though nobody on the battlefield heard it, a large segment of
the stadium audience had begun chanting, in steadily rising notes
each time the word was uttered, "DOOM DOOM DOOM DOOM DOOM", because
you just couldn't see that and <em>not</em> think it required
musical accompaniment.</p>
<p>"The crowd is cheering your grandson," said Amelia Bones. The
old witch was favoring the screen with a measuring look.</p>
<p>"So they are," said Augusta Longbottom. "Some, if I hear
correctly, are cheering, <em>Our blood for Neville! Our souls for
Neville!</em> "</p>
<p>"Quite," said Amelia, taking a sip from a teacup which had not
been there moments earlier. "It shows the lad has leadership
potential."</p>
<p>"These cheers," continued Augusta, her voice taking on an even
more stunned quality, "seem to be coming from the Hufflepuff
benches."</p>
<p>"It is the House of the loyal, my dear," said Amelia.</p>
<p>"Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore! <em>What in Merlin's
name has been happening in this school?</em> "</p>
<p>Lucius Malfoy was watching the screens with an ironic smile, his
fingers tapping at his armrest in no discernible pattern. "I do not
know what is more frightening, the thought that he has some hidden
plan behind all this, or the thought that he does not."</p>
<p>"Look!" cried the Lord of Greengrass. The dapper young man had
risen half out of his chair, pointing his finger at the screen.
"There she goes!"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"We'll both take him at once," Daphne whispered. She knew that a
few fear-filled minutes of real combat experience, a handful of
times each week, might not be enough to match Neville's regular
dueling practice with Harry and Cedric Diggory over the same
period. "He's too much for one of us, but both of us together -
I'll use my Charm, you just try to stun him -"</p>
<p>Hannah, beside her, nodded, and then they both screamed at the
top of their lungs and charged forward, the Hover Charms of two
supporting Sunshine Soldiers moving them faster and making them
light on their feet, Daphne already crying "<em>Tonare!</em> " even
as Hannah kept a huge <em>Contego</em> shield moving in front of
them, and with a brief extra lift they leapt over the heads of the
front screen of soldiers and landed in front of Neville with their
hair billowing high around them -</p>
<p>(Photographs were strictly prohibited at all Hogwarts games, but
somehow this moment <em>still</em> ended up on the front page of
the next day's <em>Quibbler</em>.)</p>
<p>- and in the same instant, because fighting older bullies had
burned away the slightest traces of hesitation, Hannah fired her
first Sleep Hex at Neville (she'd started the incantation while she
was still in the air) even as Daphne, concentrating more on speed
than on force, slashed down with her Ancient Blade at where she
thought Neville's thighs would be <em>after</em> he dodged -</p>
<p>But Neville leapt up, not sideways, leapt up higher than he
should've been able to go, so that her glowing sword cut only the
air beneath his feet. Somehow Daphne realized what it meant, that
Neville still had other Chaotics Hovering him, in time for her to
raise her Blade up over her head, but Neville <em>fell too
fast</em> and when his Blade smashed into hers it was like being
hit by a Bludger. It knocked Daphne off her feet and sent her
sprawling backward onto the grass, hitting the ground hard on her
back. It might have been all over for her, then, if Neville hadn't
landed too hard himself and gone to his knees with a pained gasp.
And then before Neville could bring his glowing Blade down, Hannah
shouted "<em>Somnium!</em> " and Neville lurched frantically
backward - though of course no spell had actually come from
Hannah's wand, the Hufflepuff girl couldn't really have fired again
that fast - which gave Daphne a second to scramble to her feet and
get both hands around her wand again -</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"Dear Merlin," said Lady Greengrass. Her voice seemed unsteady,
the aristocratic poise well-punctured. "My daughter is fighting
with the Charm of the Most Ancient Blade. In her first year. I
never knew she possessed - such extraordinary talent -"</p>
<p>"Excellent blood," Charles Nott said approvingly, causing
Augusta to snort.</p>
<p>"My good Lady," said Professor Quirrell, sounding grave. "Do not
wrong your daughter so. That is not mere talent which you see." His
voice grew a little dryer. "Rather, it is what happens when
children put their competitive efforts into a game which involves
actual spellcasting."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"<em>Expelliarmus!</em> " shouted Draco, trying not to let his
voice crack as he simultaneously dodged the blazing red stunbolt
that Hermione Granger had fired at him, his muscles twisting with
the need to dodge in the wrong direction - she'd pointed to his
left, and then with a mysterious twitch fired right -</p>
<p>Hermione dodged the fast-moving dueling hex, and cried with
hardly another moment's pause, "<em>Steleus!</em> ", a wide-angle
Hex that Draco couldn't avoid, but he managed to point his wand at
his own face and cry "<em>Quiescus!</em> " before the sudden urge
to inhale could devolve into a sneezing fit that would've ended the
battle.</p>
<p>Draco Malfoy was already half-exhausted from all the Locking
Charms and Transfigurations earlier, but his confusion was
beginning to give way to a sense of his own blood boiling, he
didn't know why Granger was attacking him so angrily all of a
sudden, but <em>if she wanted a fight he'd give her one -</em></p>
<p>(The Dragons and Sunnies weren't stopping to watch the duel of
their Generals, the Dragons were too disciplined to stop and watch
and that meant the Sunnies had to go on fighting too; but the
gaping audience in the Hogwarts Quidditch stands were being
distracted even from Neville and Daphne's spectacle, shifting their
eyes to the duel of two Generals as Malfoy and Granger fired hex
after hex and jinx after jinx at each other, casting more rapidly
than any other student in their year could have managed, the Dragon
General's trained dueling dance matched by the Sunshine General's
frantic energy, the combat between them beginning to resemble an
adult duel as the two most magically powerful first-years resorted
to spells more exotic than the usual Sleep Hex.)</p>
<p>- although, Draco was beginning to realize, when he and Harry
and Professor Quirrell had dismissed Miss Granger as having as much
intent to kill as a bowl of wet grapes, they'd never seen her
<em>angry.</em></p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Daphne lashed out with her Ancient Blade, again not trying to
hit hard but just moving the Blade as fast as possible, at the same
time Hannah cried "<em>Somnium!</em> " and Neville leapt back
again, but it had been another bluff and Hannah was moving in to
fire a real spell almost point-blank -</p>
<p>- and Neville Longbottom did exactly what - he would explain
afterward - Cedric Diggory had trained him to do if he was fighting
Bellatrix Black, which was to spin around and kick Hannah
<em>really hard</em> in the pit of her stomach.</p>
<p>The Hufflepuff girl made a sad little sound, a gasping cry of
pain, as she was knocked off her feet by the hard shoe sinking into
her abdomen with the force of Neville's whole body behind it.</p>
<p>For an instant the battlefield stood still, everything halted
except Hannah's falling form.</p>
<p>Then Neville's face turned to absolute dismay and he lowered his
wand, the Chaotic Lieutenant starting instinctively toward his
House-mate as he reached for her with his other hand -</p>
<p>Even as Hannah turned her fall into a roll and came out with her
wand raised and shot him.</p>
<p>A fractional second later, Daphne, who hadn't hesitated either,
sank her Most Ancient Blade squarely into Neville's back, causing
the Chaotic Lieutenant's muscles to jerk convulsively with the
stunning magic discharging into him even as Hannah's Sleep Hex took
effect, and then the last scion of Longbottom was sprawled still on
the ground with a look of total surprise frozen to his face.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"Today Mr. Longbottom has learned a valuable lesson about his
feelings of pity and remorse," said Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>"And chivalry," said Amelia, sipping her tea again.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"Are you all right?" whispered Daphne, as she stood protectively
over where Hannah lay on the ground clutching her stomach. The girl
didn't give anything back in reply except more retching sounds that
sounded like Hannah was trying not to throw up while trying not to
cry.</p>
<p>Somehow, even though it might not have been good tactics - it
would've been better if Hannah had been hexed outright, than for
other soldiers to be tied up protecting her - a number of Sunnies
seemed to be standing in front of Hannah with their wands clutched
tightly, staring angrily at the Chaotics. Someone had thrown up a
Prismatic barrier between the two groups, Daphne couldn't see
who.</p>
<p>And for some reason the Chaotics didn't seem to be pressing the
attack. Even Tracey had completely dropped the grim look on her
face and was shifting her weight nervously from one foot to
another, as though she was having trouble remembering which side
she was on -</p>
<p>"<em>Hold!</em> " shouted a voice. "<em>Hold battle!</em> "</p>
<p>There wasn't much battle going on anyway, but it held.</p>
<p>General Potter, looking every inch the Boy-Who-Lived, strode out
from the trees with something large and camouflage-cloth-covered
held under one arm.</p>
<p>"Is Miss Abbott breathing all right?" General Potter yelled.</p>
<p>Daphne didn't look back. She didn't trust that this wasn't a
trap - it was absolutely certain that if the Chaotics took the
opportunity to attack, Professor Quirrell would not only rule it
legal but also award them extra points afterward. But Daphne could
hear the answer well enough with her ears, it wasn't like Hannah
was trying to breathe <em>quietly</em>, and so she said, "Sort
of."</p>
<p>"She should get out of here and to someone who can use healing
Charms," Harry said. "Just in case that broke something."</p>
<p>From behind Daphne, a small gasping voice said, "I - can - still
- fight -"</p>
<p>"Miss Abbott, don't -" Harry said, just as there was the sound
from behind Daphne of someone collapsing back to the grass after
trying and failing to get to her feet. Everyone winced, but Daphne
didn't turn her back on Harry.</p>
<p>"Why haven't the teachers stopped the battle?" said Susan, her
voice angry.</p>
<p>"I expect it's because Miss Abbott is in no danger of permanent
damage and Professor Quirrell thinks we're learning valuable
lessons," Harry said in a hard voice. "Look, Miss Abbott, if you
go, Tracey will also retire from the battle. You already outnumber
us, so that's a very good deal for your side. Please take it."</p>
<p>"Hannah, just go!" said Daphne. "I mean, just say you're
out!"</p>
<p>When Daphne glanced back she saw that Hannah was shaking her
head, still curled up in a ball on the grass.</p>
<p>"Oh, screw this," said Harry. "<em>Chaotics! The faster we stun
them, the faster she's out of here! We're going to do this very
quickly, even if we take casualties! End truce!
TUNAFISH!</em> "</p>
<p>Daphne's political hindbrain had only an instant to admire how
Harry's few words had just made the Chaotics the <em>good</em>
guys, and then in almost perfect unison, the Chaotics were plunging
their hands into the pockets of their uniforms and drawing out
green sunglasses in an unfamiliar style. Not like anything you
would wear to the beach, more like goggles for advanced Potions
-</p>
<p>Then Daphne realized what was about to happen and snapped up her
other hand to shield her eyes, just as Harry ripped the cloth off
the cauldron.</p>
<p>The fluid that spilled forth as Harry Potter threw the
cauldron's contents into the air was too bright to be seen, too
brilliant to be imagined, incandescent like the Sun magnified a
dozen times -</p>
<p>(which was exactly what it was)</p>
<p>(the sunlight which had been invested to create the acorns, the
bright energy that had fueled a tree rising up from the bare
dirt)</p>
<p>(blazing a searing purple, the color of the mixed blue and red
wavelengths that chlorophyll absorbed)</p>
<p>(with almost none of the green wavelengths that chlorophyll
reflected to create the green color of leaves)</p>
<p>(which was the color of the Chaos Legion's sunglasses, made to
pass through green wavelengths, blocking red and blue, reducing
even the most incandescent purple glare to something bearable)</p>
<p>- the violet light blazed on and on, Daphne tried dropping her
arm from her eyes but found that she couldn't look directly at
anything, even the secondhand purple glare was so bright she had to
squint; and she had only time to cry one <em>Finite
Incantatem,</em> which didn't work, before a Sleep Hex took
her.</p>
<p>What was left of the battle didn't take very long after
that.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"NOW!" bellowed Blaise Zabini, formerly of Sunshine, now
commanding a detachment of Chaos Legionnaires. "I mean, TUNAFISH!"
The Slytherin boy's hand grasped the cloth shielding the cauldron
from the triggering touch of daylight, already beginning to move it
aside.</p>
<p>"NOW!" bellowed Dean Thomas, formerly of Chaos, commanding a
consignment of Dragon Warriors. "DO WHATEVER THEY DO!"</p>
<p>The Chaotics of Zabini's detachment plunged their hands into
their uniform pockets, and came forth bearing green sunglasses
-</p>
<p>- an action almost perfectly mirrored by Dean and the Dragon
Warriors, who drew forth green-colored Potions goggles, and quickly
drew the straps over their own heads, even as the Chaotics put on
their sunglasses and the violet incandescence blasted forth.</p>
<p>(As General Malfoy had explained, if Mr. Goyle reported that the
Chaos Legion was wearing green-colored Potions goggles, you didn't
have to know <em>why</em> to Transfigure some copies.)</p>
<p>"THAT'S CHEATING!" shrieked Blaise Zabini.</p>
<p>"THAT'S TECHNIQUE!" Dean yelled back. "DRAGONS, CHARGE!"</p>
<p>("Pardon me," the Lady Greengrass said. "Could you stop laughing
like that, Mr. Quirrell? It's unnerving.")</p>
<p>"FINITE THEIR GOGGLES!" shouted Blaise Zabini, as the two armies
ran headlong toward each other through omnipresent eye-searing
purple glare. "WE CAN STILL WIN!"</p>
<p>"YOU HEARD HIM!" bellowed Dean. "GET THEIR GLASSES!"</p>
<p>Blaise Zabini's reply to this wasn't anything articulate.</p>
<p>That battle went on a lot longer.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"<em>Stupefy!</em> " shrieked the Sunshine General.</p>
<p>Draco didn't dodge, he didn't counter, he didn't have enough
energy left for either, all he could do was whip his left hand into
position and hope -</p>
<p>The red stunbolt dissipated again on Draco's
<em>Colloportused</em> glove, which he'd Transfigured and
spell-locked to his hand the same as the rest of Dragon Army. It
was all that was saving him now, that shield.</p>
<p>It should have been a time to counterattack, but Draco could
only catch his breath, as the two of them danced backward and
forward beneath the trees in the never-ending movements of their
duel. Across from him, General Granger was panting hard, the young
girl's face glistening with sweat like dew, her chestnut hair
wetted into brown plaits. Her camouflage uniform was stained with
damp spots, her shoulders visibly trembling with exhaustion, but
her wand was still steel-steady where it stayed level on Draco
through all their motion. Her eyes glaring, her cheeks flushed with
rage.</p>
<p><em>So, little girl, why're you pretending to fight like a
grownup today?</em></p>
<p>The taunt came to mind, but he didn't really think he needed
Granger any angrier; so instead Draco just said - though he could
hear his own voice cracking - "Any reason you're feeling mad at me,
Granger?"</p>
<p>The girl was gasping for breath herself, her own voice wobbling
as she spoke. "I know what you're up to," said Hermione Granger,
her voice rising. "I know what you and Snape are up to, Malfoy, and
I know who's behind it!"</p>
<p>"Huh?" Draco said without even thinking about it.</p>
<p>That only seemed to increase Granger's fury, and her fingers
whitened on the wand she held leveled on him.</p>
<p>And then Draco got it, and it boiled his own blood in his veins.
Even <em>she</em> thought he was secretly plotting against her
-</p>
<p>"<em>You too?</em> " Draco yelled. "<em>I helped you, you
bucktoothed bint! You, you, you," -</em> stuttering past all the
Dark curses that came to mind until he found something he could
actually cast at her - "<em>DENSAUGEO!</em> "</p>
<p>But Granger flashed and whirled around the Tooth-Lengthening
Hex, and then her own wand came around and leveled at almost
point-blank range, even as Draco brought up his left hand like a
shield, placing the magic-locked glove between himself and whatever
she was about to fire, and the Sunshine General's own voice rose to
a shriek audible across the whole battleground -</p>
<p>"<em>ALOHOMORA!</em> "</p>
<p>Time should have paused.</p>
<p>But it didn't.</p>
<p>Instead the padlock clicked and fell off the glove.</p>
<p>Just like that.</p>
<p>Just like that.</p>
<p>The screens showed it all very clearly, to the entire watching
Hogwarts stadium.</p>
<p>And the bone-dead-silent hush that fell over every bench in
every bleacher said that everyone understood quite clearly what it
meant, that the scion of House Malfoy had just had his magic
overcome by a Muggleborn.</p>
<p>Hermione Granger didn't pause in her fight, gave no sign that
she even knew what she'd done; instead her foot snapped out in a
Muggle-style kick that knocked Draco's wand cleanly out of his
hand, his shocked mind and body moving just a little too slowly.
Draco dove after his wand, scrabbling frantically on the ground,
but from behind him a girl's cracking voice said
"<em>Somnium!</em> " and Draco Malfoy fell and didn't rise
again.</p>
<p>There was another moment of frozen silence. The Sunshine General
was wobbling on her feet, looking like she might faint.</p>
<p>Then the Dragon Warriors screamed at the top of their lungs and
charged forward to avenge their fallen commander.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Davis were shaking as they stood up from the
comfortable chairs of the faculty Quidditch box; they couldn't
quite clutch each other while walking, but they held hands tightly,
pretending hard to be invisible. If they'd been children young
enough for accidental magic they probably would've spontaneously
Disillusioned themselves.</p>
<p>The elderly Charles Nott said nothing as he stood from his
chair. The scarred Lord Jugson said nothing, as he stood from his
own chair.</p>
<p>Lucius Malfoy said nothing as he stood.</p>
<p>All three of them turned without pause and strode toward the
stairwell of the elevated bleachers, moving in eerie unison like an
Auror trio -</p>
<p>"Lord Malfoy," the Defense Professor said in mild tones. That
man was still seated in his own chair, looking upon his
parchment-like screens, arms limp at his side, as though for some
reason he didn't feel like moving.</p>
<p>The white-haired man halted just before reaching the exit
archway, and the elderly man and the scarred man halted as well,
flanking him. Lord Malfoy's head turned, too slightly to be any
form of acknowledgement, but in the Defense Professor's
direction.</p>
<p>"Your son performed exceptionally well today," said Professor
Quirrell. "I must confess that I underestimated him. And he has
earned his army's loyalty, as you have witnessed." Still very mild,
the Defense Professor's voice. "Speaking as your son's teacher, it
is my opinion that he will not benefit if you interfere in his
-"</p>
<p>Lord Malfoy and his compatriots vanished down the stairs.</p>
<p>"A fine try, Quirinus," Dumbledore said quietly. The old
wizard's face showed small lines of worry; he hadn't risen from his
own seat either, staring at the parchment screens as though they
were still active. "Do you think he will listen?"</p>
<p>The Defense Professor's shoulders twitched in a slight shrug,
the only movement they'd shown since the battle ended.</p>
<p>"<em>Well</em>," said the Lady Greengrass, as she rose up and
cracked her knuckles, stretching, her husband silent beside her. "I
must say, that was quite... interesting..."</p>
<p>Amelia Bones had risen from her own cushioned seat without any
fuss. "Interesting indeed," said Director Bones. "I do confess, I
find myself disturbed by the skill with which those children were
fighting one another."</p>
<p>"The skill?" Lord Greengrass said. "Their spells didn't seem all
that impressive to me. Except for Daphne's, of course."</p>
<p>The old witch did not move her eyes from where she was gazing at
the Defense Professor's balding head. "The Stunning Hex is not a
first-year spell, Lord Greengrass, but that is not the skill I had
in mind. They supported each other with those simple spells, they
reacted at speed to surprises..." The Director of the DMLE paused,
as though searching for words that a mere civilian could
understand. "In the midst of battle," she said finally, "with
spells flying in every direction... those children seemed quite at
home."</p>
<p>"Indeed, Director Bones," said the Defense Professor. "Some arts
are best begun in youth."</p>
<p>The old witch's eyes narrowed. "You are readying them to become
a military force, Professor. To what end?"</p>
<p>"Now hold on!" interjected Lord Greengrass. "There's plenty of
schools where they teach dueling in first year!"</p>
<p>"Dueling?" said the Defense Professor. From behind it wasn't
visible if the pale face was smiling. "That is nothing, Lord
Greengrass, to what my students have learned. They have learned not
to hesitate in the face of ambushes and greater foes. They have
learned to adapt when combat conditions change and change again.
They have learned to protect their allies, to protect more those
who are more valuable, to abandon pieces which cannot be rescued.
They have learned that to survive they must follow orders. Some
have even learned a little creativity. Oh, no, Lord Greengrass,
<em>these</em> wizards will not hide in their manors and wait to be
protected, when the next threat comes. They will know that they
know how to fight."</p>
<p>Augusta Longbottom loudly clapped her hands together three
times.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>We won.</em></p>
<p>It was the first thing Draco heard when he woke up on the
battlefield, Padma telling him how his soldiers had rallied after
he fell. How, thanks to the Dragon General's foresight, Mr. Thomas
had led his detachment to victory over Chaos. How General Potter
had defeated the portion of the Sunshine Regiment that clashed with
him. How Mr. Thomas's Dragon Warriors had rejoined the main body of
soldiers bearing both their own goggles and the sunglasses of the
defeated Chaotics. How, only moments later, General Potter's
remaining contingent had attacked both other armies with a potion
that emitted searing purple light. But Dragon had held the
numerical advantage over Sunshine and Chaos both, and enough
sunglasses for their warriors; and so Padma had managed to lead her
inherited army to victory.</p>
<p>From the light in Padma's eyes and her arrogant smile that would
have done proud to a Malfoy, she was expecting congratulations.
Draco managed to grit out some form of praise from between his
clenched teeth, and couldn't have said afterward what it was. The
foreign-born witch, it appeared, hadn't any idea what'd happened,
or what it meant.</p>
<p><em>I lost.</em></p>
<p>The Dragons trudged back to Hogwarts beneath gray skies, cold
droplets landing heavy on Draco's skin, one by one. While he'd been
stunned, it had begun, the long-promised rain finally beginning to
fall. There was only one option left to Draco now. A forced move,
as Mr. MacNair, who'd taught Draco chess, would have termed it.
Harry Potter probably wouldn't like it, if he really was in love
with Granger the way everyone said. But the forced move, as Mr.
MacNair had defined it, was one you needed to make if you wanted
the game to continue at all.</p>
<p>It kept on playing in Draco's mind, over and over again, even as
he walked like an automaton through the massive portals of
Hogwarts, sent away Vincent and Gregory with two sharp words, and
became alone within his private bedroom, sitting on his bed,
staring at the wall above his desk. Filling his mind like a
Dementor had locked him into the memory.</p>
<p>The padlock on his glove clicking and falling away -</p>
<p>Draco knew, he <em>knew</em> what he'd done wrong. He'd been so
tired after casting twenty-seven Locking Charms for all the other
Dragon Warriors. Less than a minute wasn't enough time to recover
after each spell. And so he'd <em>just</em> cast
<em>Colloportus</em> on his own padlocked glove, <em>just</em> cast
the spell, not put in all his strength to bind it stronger than
Harry Potter or Hermione Granger could undo.</p>
<p>But nobody was going to believe that, even if it was true. Even
in Slytherin, nobody would believe that. It sounded like an excuse,
and an excuse was all that anyone would hear.</p>
<p><em>Granger whirled and spun and screamed 'ALOHOMORA!'</em>
-</p>
<p>Draco's mind kept playing it over and over as the resentment
built. He'd helped Granger - cooperated with her on banning
traitors - held her hand as she'd dangled off the roof - stopped a
riot from breaking out around her in the Great Hall - did she have
any idea what he'd risked, what he'd probably already
<em>lost</em>, what it meant for the heir of House Malfoy to do
that for a <em>mudblood</em> -</p>
<p>And now there was only one move left, and the thing about a
forced move was that you <em>had</em> to make it, even if it meant
getting detention and losing House points. Professor Snape would
know and understand, but there were limits (Father had warned him)
to what the Potions Master would overlook.</p>
<p>Challenge Granger to a wizard's duel, in open defiance of
Hogwarts regulations. Attack her outright, if she tried to refuse.
Defeat her one-on-one, in public, not with clever dueling
technique, but by <em>overpowering</em> her magic. Beat her
solidly, completely, crush her as utterly as the Dark Lord himself
had crushed his enemies. Make it absolutely clear to everyone, so
that nobody could possibly doubt, that Draco had just been
exhausted from casting the spell so many times. Prove that the
Malfoy blood was stronger than any mudblood's -</p>
<p><em>Only it's not,</em> Harry Potter's voice whispered inside
Draco's mind. <em>It's easy to forget what's really true, Draco,
once you start trying to win at politics. But in reality there's
only one thing that makes you a wizard, remember?</em></p>
<p>Draco knew, then, he knew the reason for the disquiet in the
back of his mind, as he stared at the blank wall above his desk
contemplating his forced move. It should've been simple - when you
only had one move, the thing to do was make it - but -</p>
<p><em>Granger whirling, spinning, sweat-dampened hair flying
around her, bolts flying from her wand as fast as his own, jinx and
counter-jinx, glowing bats flying at his face, and through all of
it the look of fury in Granger's eyes -</em></p>
<p>There'd been a part of him admiring that, before it had all gone
wrong, admiring Granger's fury and power; a part of him that had
exulted in the first real fight he'd ever been in, against...</p>
<p>...an equal opponent.</p>
<p>If he challenged Granger, and <em>lost...</em></p>
<p>It ought not to be possible, Draco had gotten his wand two full
years before anyone else in his Hogwarts class.</p>
<p>Only there was a reason why they usually didn't bother giving
wands to nine-year-olds. Age counted too, it wasn't just how long
you'd held a wand. Granger's birthday had been only a few days into
the year, when Harry had bought her that pouch. That meant she was
twelve now, that she'd been twelve almost since the start of
Hogwarts. And the truth was, Draco hadn't been practicing much
outside of class, probably not nearly as much as Hermione Granger
of Ravenclaw. Draco hadn't thought he needed any more practice to
stay ahead...</p>
<p><em>And Granger was exhausted too,</em> whispered the Voice of
Contrary Evidence inside him. Granger must have been exhausted from
all those Stunning Hexes, and even in that state she'd been able to
undo his Locking Charm.</p>
<p>And Draco <em>could not</em> afford to challenge Granger
publicly, one-on-one with no excuses, and lose.</p>
<p>Draco knew what you were supposed to do in this sort of
situation. You were supposed to cheat. But if anyone discovered
Draco cheating, it would be disastrous, perfect blackmail material
even if it never got out publicly, and any Slytherins watching
would <em>know</em> that, they'd be <em>looking</em>...</p>
<p>And then, if you were watching, you would have seen Draco Malfoy
get up from his bed, and go to his desk, and take out a sheet of
the finest sheepskin parchment, and a pearl-carven inkwell, filled
with greenish-silver ink that had been made with true silver and
crushed emeralds. From the great trunk at his bed's foot, the
Slytherin drew forth a book bound also in silver and emeralds,
entitled <em>The Etiquette of the Houses of Britain.</em> And with
a new, clean quill, Draco Malfoy began to write, frequently looking
to the book where it lay open as a reference. There was a grim
smile on the boy's face, making the young Malfoy look very much
like his father, as he carefully drew each letter as though it were
a separate artwork.</p>
<p><em>From Draco, son of Lucius son of Abraxis Lords of the Noble
and Most Ancient House of Malfoy, son also of Narcissa daughter of
Druella Lady of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black, scion
and heir of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy:</em></p>
<p><em>To Hermione, the first Granger:</em></p>
<p>(That form might have been meant to sound polite, long ago when
it had been invented; nowadays, after centuries of being used to
address mudbloods, it carried a lovely tinge of refined venom.)</p>
<p><em>I, Draco, of Most Ancient House, demand redress,
for</em></p>
<p>Draco paused, carefully moving the quill aside so that it
wouldn't drip. He needed a pretext for this, at least if he wanted
to impose the duel's conditions. The challenged had the choice of
terms <em>unless</em> they had insulted a Noble House. He needed to
make it look like Granger had insulted him...</p>
<p>What was he thinking? Granger <em>had</em> insulted him.</p>
<p>Draco flipped the book to the page of standard formulae, and
found one that seemed appropriate.</p>
<p><em>I, Draco, of Most Ancient House, demand redress, for that I
have thrice over helped you and offered you only my goodwill, and
in return you <span style="text-decoration:underline;">falsely</span> accused me of plotting
against you,</em></p>
<p>Draco had to stop and take a breath, forcing down the seething
anger; he was starting to genuinely feel the insult now, and he'd
just written out the last phrase and underlined it without
thinking, like it was an ordinary letter. After a moment's
reflection, he decided to let it stand; it might not be the exact
formal phrasing but it had a raw, angry tone that seemed
appropriate.</p>
<p><em>which insult you committed before the eyes of
Britain.</em></p>
<p><em>Thus I, Draco, compel you, Hermione, by custom, by law,
by</em></p>
<p>"The seventeenth ruling of the thirty-first Wizengamot," Draco
said aloud without looking, a line delivered in many plays; he sat
straighter as he said it, feeling every pulse of the noble blood in
his veins.</p>
<p><em>Thus I, Draco, compel you, Hermione, by custom, by law, by
the 17th ruling of the 31st Wizengamot, to meet me in wizard's duel
with terms: That we each come alone and in silence, speaking to
none before or after,</em></p>
<p>If the duel went poorly, Draco could just say nothing and leave
it at that. And if he did defeat Granger, he would have learned
experimentally that he could beat her <em>again</em> in a public
challenge. It wasn't cheating, but it was Science, which was almost
as good.</p>
<p><em>contesting by magic solely, without death or lasting
injury,</em></p>
<p>...where? Draco had been told about a room in Hogwarts that was
good for duels, where everything valuable was already protected by
wards, and there were no portraits to tattle on you... which one
had it been again...</p>
<p><em>in the trophy room of the Castle of the Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry,</em></p>
<p>And their second and public duel had better be soon, like
tomorrow, it would take very little time for his reputation in
Slytherin to go irretrievably to sludge. He needed to fight Granger
for the first time <em>tonight</em>.</p>
<p><em>upon midnight's stroke that shall end this very
day.</em></p>
<p><em>Draco, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of
Malfoy.</em></p>
<p>Draco signed the formal parchment, and then drew forth his
ordinary and lesser parchment, and his regular ink, for his post
scriptum:</p>
<p><em>If you don't know how the rules work, Granger, here's how it
is. You insulted a Most Ancient House, and I've got the lawful
right to challenge. And if you affront the conditions of the duel,
like by having Flitwick show up at the trophy room, or even just
telling anyone else, my father will take you and your false honor
straight to the Wizengamot.</em></p>
<p><em>Draco Malfo</em></p>
<p>On the last letter his quill pressed down on the parchment so
viciously that the nib snapped off, creating a streak of ink and a
small rip in the parchment, which Draco decided also looked
appropriate.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>That night at dinnertime, Susan Bones came to Harry Potter and
told him that she thought Draco Malfoy was going to carry out his
plot against Hermione very soon. She was warning all the members of
S.P.H.E.W., and she'd warned Professor Sprout, and she'd warned
Professor Flitwick, and she was going to send a letter to her Aunt
tonight, and now she was warning Harry Potter, too. Only they
couldn't quite talk about it with Padma - Susan said, looking very
serious - because Padma was feeling torn between her loyalty to
Hermione and her loyalty to her General.</p>
<p>Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, who was at this point feeling
more frustrated with the entire situation than anything really
<em>productive</em>, snapped at her that <em>yes</em>, he knew
something had to be done.</p>
<p>After Susan Bones left, Harry looked over at the other end of
the Ravenclaw table, where Hermione had sat down away from him or
Padma or Anthony or any of her other friends.</p>
<p>But Hermione didn't look like she was in a mood where somebody
going over and bothering her would be taken very well.</p>
<p>Later, looking backward, Harry would think of how, in his SF and
fantasy novels, people always made their big, important choices for
big, important reasons. Hari Seldon had created his Foundation to
rebuild the ashes of the Galactic Empire, not because he would look
more important if he could be in charge of his own research group.
Raistlin Majere had severed ties with his brother because he wanted
to become a god, not because he was incompetent at personal
relationships and unwilling to ask for advice on how to do better.
Frodo Baggins had taken the Ring because he was a hero who wanted
to save Middle-Earth, not because it would've been too awkward not
to. If anyone ever wrote a true history of the world - not that
anyone ever could or would - probably 97% of all the key moments of
Fate would turn out to be constructed of lies and tissue paper and
trivial little thoughts that somebody could've just as easily
thought differently.</p>
<p>Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres looked at Hermione Granger,
where she'd sat down at the other end of the table, and felt a
sense of reluctance to bother her when she looked like she was
already in a bad mood.</p>
<p>So then Harry thought that it probably made more sense to talk
to Draco Malfoy first, just so that he could absolutely positively
definitely assure Hermione that Draco really wasn't plotting
against her.</p>
<p>And later on after dinner, when Harry went down to the Slytherin
basement and was told by Vincent that <em>the boss ain't to be
disturbed</em>... then Harry thought that maybe he should see if
Hermione would talk to him right away. That he should just get
started on unraveling the whole mess before it raveled any further.
Harry wondered if he might just be procrastinating, if his mind had
just found a clever excuse to put off something
unenjoyable-but-necessary.</p>
<p>He actually thought that.</p>
<p>And then Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres decided that he'd just
talk to Draco Malfoy the next morning instead, after Sunday
breakfast, and <em>then</em> talk to Hermione.</p>
<p>Human beings did that sort of thing all the time.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>It was Sunday morning, on the 5th of April, 1992, and the
simulated sky above the Great Hall of Hogwarts showed great
torrents of rain pouring down in such density that the lightning
flashes were diminished and scattered into small pulses of white
light that sometimes transformed the House tables, paling their
faces and making all the students appear briefly to be ghosts.</p>
<p>Harry sat at the Ravenclaw table, wearily eating a waffle,
waiting for Draco to make an appearance so that he could get
started on sorting this whole thing out. There was a
<em>Quibbler</em> being passed around which had somehow ended up
with Hannah and Daphne on the front page, but it hadn't gotten to
his place yet.</p>
<p>A few minutes later Harry finished eating his waffle, and then
looked around again to see if Draco had arrived yet for breakfast
at the Slytherin table.</p>
<p>It was odd.</p>
<p>Draco Malfoy was almost never late.</p>
<p>Since Harry was looking in the direction of the Slytherin table,
he didn't see Hermione Granger entering through the huge doors of
the Great Hall. Thus he was rather startled when he turned back and
discovered Hermione sitting down directly beside him at the
Ravenclaw table, just as if she hadn't not-done that for more than
a week.</p>
<p>"Hi, Harry," Hermione said, her voice sounding almost exactly
normal. She started to put toast on her plate and a selection of
healthy fruits and vegetables. "How are you?"</p>
<p>"Within one standard deviation of my own peculiar little
average," Harry automatically replied. "How are you doing? Did you
sleep okay?"</p>
<p>There were dark bags under Hermione Granger's eyes.</p>
<p>"Why, yes, I'm fine," said Hermione Granger.</p>
<p>"Um," Harry said. He took a slice of pie onto his plate (as his
brain was occupied with other things, Harry's hand simply took the
tastiest thing within range, without evaluating complex concepts
like whether he was ready to eat dessert). "Um, Hermione, I'm going
to need to talk to you later today, is that okay?"</p>
<p>"Sure," said Hermione. "Why wouldn't it be?"</p>
<p>"Because -" Harry said. "I mean - you and I haven't - for the
last few days -"</p>
<p><em>Shut up,</em> suggested an internal part of Harry that
seemed to have been recently allocated for governing
Hermione-related issues.</p>
<p>Hermione Granger didn't look like she was paying much attention
to him in any case. She just stared down at her plate, and then,
after about ten seconds of awkward silence, began to eat her tomato
slices, one after another, without pause.</p>
<p>Harry looked away from her and began to eat a slice of pie
which, he discovered, had somehow materialized on his plate.</p>
<p>"So!" Hermione Granger suddenly said after she'd polished off
most of her plate in silence. "Anything happening today?"</p>
<p>"Um..." Harry said. He looked around frantically, as though to
find something-happening that he could use as conversational
fodder.</p>
<p>And so Harry was one of the first to see it, and wordlessly
point, although the sudden swell of whispers that swept through the
Great Hall showed that a number of other people had seen it
too.</p>
<p>The distinctive crimson tinge of the robes would have been
recognizable anywhere, but it still took Harry's brain a few
moments to place the faces. An Asianish-looking man, solemn, and
today looking rather grim. A man with a piercing gaze that swept
over the room, his long black hair waving behind him in a ponytail.
A man thin and pale and unshaven, with a face so blank that it was
like stone. It took Harry a few moment to place the faces, and
remember the names, from that long-ago day in January when the
Dementor had come to Hogwarts: <em>Komodo, Butnaru,
Goryanof.</em></p>
<p>"An Auror trio?" Hermione said in a strange bright voice. "Why,
I wonder what they'd be doing here."</p>
<p>Dumbledore was in their company as well, looking as worried as
Harry had ever seen him; and after a moment's pause while the old
wizard's eyes scanned the Great Hall and the students whispering
over their breakfasts, he pointed -</p>
<p>- straight at Harry.</p>
<p>"Oh, now what," Harry said under his breath. His inward thoughts
were a lot more panicked than that, as he wondered frantically if
anyone had connected him to the Azkaban breakout somehow. He looked
at the Head Table, trying to make the glance casual, and realized
that Professor Quirrell was nowhere to be seen, this morning -</p>
<p>The Aurors swept toward him with swift strides, Auror Goryanof
approaching from the other side of the Ravenclaw table as though to
block any escape in that direction, Auror Komodo and Auror Butnaru
approaching from Harry's side, the Headmaster following straight on
Komodo's heels.</p>
<p>All conversation everywhere had ground to utter silence.</p>
<p>The Aurors reached Harry's place at the table, surrounding him
from three angles.</p>
<p>"Yes?" Harry said, as normally as he could. "What is it?"</p>
<p>"Hermione Granger," Auror Komodo said in a toneless voice, "you
are under arrest for the attempted murder of Draco Malfoy."</p>
</div>
<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 79: Taboo Tradeoffs, Pt
1<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p><em>"Hermione Granger," Auror Komodo said in a toneless voice,
"you are under arrest for the attempted murder of Draco
Malfoy."</em></p>
<p>The words dropped into Harry's consciousness and shattered his
thoughts into a hundred shards of incredulity, the shock of
adrenaline running into so much confusion that -</p>
<p>"She -" Harry said. "She - she wouldn't - WHAT?"</p>
<p>The Aurors weren't paying any attention to him. Komodo spoke
again, still in that colorless voice. "Mr. Malfoy has regained
consciousness in St. Mungo's and named you, Hermione Granger, as
his assaulter. He has repeated these accusations under two drops of
Veritaserum. The Blood-Cooling Charm you cast upon Mr. Malfoy would
have killed him if he had not been found and treated, and it must
be presumed known to you that this was a fatal curse. I therefore
arrest you upon the serious charge of attempted murder and you will
be taken into Ministry custody to be interrogated under three drops
of Veritaserum -"</p>
<p>"<em>Are you mad?</em> " the words burst out of Harry's mouth,
as he shoved himself up from the Ravenclaw table, an instant before
Auror Butnaru's hand clamped down hard upon his shoulder. Harry
ignored it. "That's <em>Hermione Granger</em> you're trying to
arrest, the nicest girl in Ravenclaw, she helps Hufflepuffs with
their homework, she'd <em>die</em> before she tried to kill
<em>anyone -</em>"</p>
<p>Hermione Granger's face had crumpled. "I did it," she whispered
in a tiny voice. "It was me."</p>
<p>Another huge rock fell on Harry's thoughts and crushed their
fragile order, bursting fragments of comprehension into dust.</p>
<p>Dumbledore's face seemed to have aged decades over the course of
seconds. "Why, Miss Granger?" Dumbledore said, his own voice barely
above a whisper. "Why would you do such a thing?"</p>
<p>"I'm," Hermione said, "I'm, I'm - sorry - I don't know why I -"
She seemed to collapse in on herself, her voice was formed of
nothing but sobs, and the only words that could be made out were,
"I thought - killed him - sorry -"</p>
<p>And Harry should have said something, should have done
something, should have jumped up out of his seat and stunned all
three Aurors and then gone on to some incredibly clever next move,
but the twice-shattered fragments of his thought processes could
yield no output. Butnaru's hand pushed Harry gently but firmly back
into his seat and Harry found himself <em>stuck</em> there like
he'd been glued, he tried to grab his wand for a <em>Finite</em>
and it wouldn't come out of his pocket, the three Aurors and
Dumbledore escorted Hermione out of the Great Hall amid a rising
storm of outcries and the doors began to swing shut behind them -
nothing made sense, it was surreal beyond all reckoning, like he'd
been transported into an alternate universe, and then Harry's mind
flashed back to another day of confusion and in a moment of
desperate inspiration he finally realized what the Weasley twins
had done to Rita Skeeter, and his voice rose in a scream,
"<em>HERMIONE YOU DIDN'T DO IT YOU'VE BEEN
FALSE-MEMORY-CHARMED!"</em></p>
<p>But the doors had already shut.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Minerva couldn't possibly have stood still, she paced back and
forth through the Headmaster's office, the back of her mind
half-expecting Severus or Harry to tell her to shut up and sit
down, but neither the Potions Master or the Boy-Who-Lived seemed
much concerned with her, both of their gazes focused on Albus
Dumbledore where he had emerged from the Floo. There were sounds in
the background that nobody heard. Severus seemed as passionless as
ever, sitting in a small cushioned chair beside the Headmaster's
desk. The old wizard stood terrible and upright by the
still-burning fireplace, robed in black like a starless night,
radiating power and dismay. All her own thoughts were of utter
confusion and horror. Harry Potter sat on a wooden stool with his
fingers gripping the seat, and his eyes were fury and freezing
ice.</p>
<p>At 6:33am, Quirinus Quirrell had Flooed St. Mungo's from his
office for immediate pickup of Draco Malfoy. Professor Quirrell had
found Mr. Malfoy in the trophy room of Hogwarts, on the verge of
death from the continuing effects of the Blood-Cooling Charm slowly
lowering his body temperature. Professor Quirrell had immediately
dispelled the Charm, cast stabilizing spells on Mr. Malfoy, and
levitated him to his office to Floo him to St. Mungo's for further
treatment. After this, Professor Quirrell had informed the
Headmaster, stating the facts briefly before vanishing through the
Floo; the Aurors, notified by St. Mungo's, had demanded his
presence for questioning.</p>
<p>The clear intent of the Blood-Cooling Charm had been to kill
Draco Malfoy so slowly that the wards of Hogwarts, set to detect
sudden injury, would not trigger. Under interrogation, Professor
Quirrell had told the Aurors that he had cast several tracking
Charms upon Mr. Malfoy's person in January, shortly after Mr.
Malfoy's return to Hogwarts from Yuletime break. Professor Quirrell
had cast tracking Charms because he had learned of a person with a
motive to harm Mr. Malfoy. Professor Quirrell had refused to
identify this person. The tracking Charms which Professor Quirrell
had cast were triggered by Mr. Malfoy's health falling below an
absolute level, rather than by sudden changes, and had therefore
alerted Professor Quirrell before Mr. Malfoy had died.</p>
<p>Two drops of Veritaserum, sufficient to prevent Mr. Malfoy from
withholding any meliorating or moderating information in his
statements, had shown that Mr. Malfoy had - legally under the laws
of Noble Houses, illegally under the regulations of Hogwarts -
challenged Hermione Granger to a duel. Mr. Malfoy had won the duel
but had then, as he left, been attacked from behind by Miss Granger
with a Stunning Hex. After this Mr. Malfoy knew nothing.</p>
<p>Three drops of Veritaserum, requiring her to volunteer all
relevant information, had caused Hermione Granger to confess that
she had stunned Draco Malfoy from behind, and then, in a fit of
anger, cast the Blood-Cooling Charm on him, with the deliberate
intention of killing him slowly enough to evade identification from
the Hogwarts wards, whose workings she had read about in
<em>Hogwarts: A History</em>. She had been horrified at herself
upon awakening the next morning, but had not told anyone of what
she'd done, believing Draco Malfoy to be already dead - as he
certainly would have been after seven hours, had his body's own
magic not been resisting the effects of the Blood-Cooling
Charm.</p>
<p>"Her trial," said Albus Dumbledore, "is set for tomorrow at
noon."</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " the word burst out of Harry Potter. The
Boy-Who-Lived didn't rise from his chair, but Minerva saw his
fingers whiten where they gripped the wooden seat beneath him.
"That's insane! You can't do a police investigation in one day
-"</p>
<p>The Potions Master raised his voice. "This is not
<em>Muggle</em> Britain, Mr. Potter!" Severus's face was as
expressionless as ever, but the bite in his voice was sharp. "The
Aurors have an accusation under Veritaserum and a confession under
Veritaserum. So far as they are concerned, the investigation is
<em>done</em>."</p>
<p>"Not quite," said Dumbledore, just as Harry seemed ready to
explode. "I have insisted to Amelia that this matter be given the
utmost scrutiny. Unfortunately, as the ill-fated duel was at
midnight -"</p>
<p>"<em>Supposed</em> duel," Harry said sharply.</p>
<p>"As the <em>supposed</em> duel was at midnight - yes, you're
quite right, Harry - it is beyond the range of any Time-Turner
-"</p>
<p>"Also <em>supposedly</em>," the Boy-Who-Lived said coldly. "And
rather <em>suspiciously</em>, since the alleged murder suspect
doesn't know about Time-Turners. I hope that an invisible Auror was
immediately sent back in time as far as possible to observe -"</p>
<p>Dumbledore inclined his head. "I went <em>myself,</em> Harry,
the moment I heard. But by the time I reached the trophy room, Mr.
Malfoy was already unconscious and Miss Granger had gone -"</p>
<p>"No," said Harry Potter. "You reached the trophy room and saw
Draco unconscious. That is all you observed, Headmaster. You did
not <em>observe</em> Hermione there, or watch her leave. Let us
distinguish observation from inference." The boy's head turned to
look at her. "Imperius, Obliviation, False Memory Charm,
Legilimency. Professor McGonagall, am I leaving out any
mind-affecting spell that could have made Hermione do this or make
her believe she'd done it?"</p>
<p>"The Confundus Charm," she said. And the Dark Arts had never
been her study, but she knew - "And certain Dark rituals. But none
of those could be performed in Hogwarts without alarm."</p>
<p>The boy nodded, his eyes still directly addressing her. "Which
of those spells can be detected? Which would the Aurors try to
detect?"</p>
<p>"The Confundus Charm would wear off in a few hours," she said,
after a moment to gather her thoughts. "Miss Granger would remember
the Imperius. Obliviation cannot be detected by any known means,
but only a Professor could have cast that spell upon a student
without alarm from the Hogwarts wards. Legilimency - can only be
detected by another Legilimens, I think -"</p>
<p>"I requested that Miss Granger be examined by the court
Legilimens," said Dumbledore. "The examination showed -"</p>
<p>"Do we trust him?" said Harry.</p>
<p>"Her," said Dumbledore. "Sophie McJorgenson, whom I remember as
an honest student of Ravenclaw, and she is bound by the Unbreakable
Vow to tell the truth of what she sees -"</p>
<p>"Could someone else be Polyjuiced as her?" Harry Potter
interrupted again. "What did you <em>observe,</em> Headmaster?"</p>
<p>Albus said heavily, "A person who looked like Madam McJorgenson
told us that a single Legilimens had lightly touched Miss Granger's
mind some months ago. That is from January, Harry, when I
communicated with Miss Granger about the matter of a certain
Dementor. That was expected; but what I did not expect was the rest
of what Sophie found." The old wizard turned to gaze into the Floo
fire, letting the orange flames reflect on his face. "As you say,
Harry, a False Memory Charm is one possibility; they are, when cast
perfectly, indistinguishable from true memory -"</p>
<p>"That doesn't surprise me," Harry interrupted. "Studies show
that human memories are more or less rewritten every time we
remember them -"</p>
<p>"Harry," Minerva said softly, and the boy's mouth clamped
shut.</p>
<p>The old wizard continued. "- but a False Memory Charm of such
quality requires as much time to create as a true memory. Creating
a detailed memory of ten minutes would be ten minutes' work. And
according to the court Legilimens," Albus's face now seemed more
tired and lined than before, "Miss Granger has been obsessing over
Mr. Malfoy since the day that Severus... yelled at her. She has
been thinking of how Mr. Malfoy might be in league with Professor
Snape, how he might be planning to harm her and harm Harry -
imagining it for hours every day - it would be impossible to create
false memories for so much time."</p>
<p>"The appearance of insanity..." Severus murmured softly, as
though he were speaking to himself. "<em>Could</em> it be natural?
No, it is too disastrous to be pure accident; too convenient for
<em>someone,</em> I have no doubt. A Muggle drug, perhaps? But that
would not be enough - Miss Granger's madness would have to be
<em>guided</em> -"</p>
<p>"Ah!" Harry said suddenly. "I get it now. The <em>first</em>
False Memory Charm was cast on Hermione after Professor Snape
yelled at her, and showed, say, Draco and Professor Snape plotting
to kill her. Then last night that False Memory was <em>removed</em>
by Obliviation, leaving behind the memories of her obsessing about
Draco for no apparent reason, at the same time she and Draco were
given false memories of the duel."</p>
<p>Minerva blinked in startlement. It would have been a thousand
years before she thought of that possibility.</p>
<p>The Potions Master was frowning thoughtfully, eyes intent. "The
<em>reaction</em> to a False Memory Charm is hard to predict in
advance, Mr. Potter, without Legilimency. The subjects do not
always act as expected, when they first remember the false
memories. It would have been a risky ploy. But I suppose that is
one way Professor Quirrell could have done it."</p>
<p>"<em>Professor Quirrell?</em> " said Harry. "What motive does
<em>he</em> have to -"</p>
<p>The Potions Master said dryly, "The Defense Professor is always
a suspect, Mr. Potter. You will notice a trend, given time."</p>
<p>Albus raised up a hand, a silencing gesture, and their heads all
turned to look at him. "But in this case there is another suspect,"
Albus said quietly. "Voldemort."</p>
<p>That deadliest of unspeakable words seemed to echo around the
room, canceling all the heat from the orange flames of the
fireplace.</p>
<p>"I do not know," the old wizard said slowly, "I know all too
little, of the methods of Voldemort's immortality. He searched out
those books before I did, I think. All I could find were ancient
tales, scattered across too many volumes for him to remove. But to
find truth among many stories is also a wizard's mastery, and this
I have endeavored to do. There is a human sacrifice, a murder, of
that I am certain; committed in coldest blood, the victim dying in
horror. And old, old tales of wizards possessed, doing mad deeds,
claiming the names of Dark Lords thought defeated; and there is
usually a device, of that Dark Lord, which they wield..." Albus
looked at Harry, the ancient eyes searching the younger. "I think,
Harry - though you will call it only inference - that the act of
murder splits the soul. That by ritual of blackest horror, the torn
fragment of soul is chained to this world. To a material thing of
this world. Which must be, or which then becomes, a device of
power."</p>
<p><em>Horcrux.</em> The terrible name echoed in Minerva's mind,
though it seemed that - for what reason she did not know - Albus
would not speak that word in front of Harry.</p>
<p>"And therefore," the old wizard finished quietly, "the remainder
of the soul is bound to its chained part, lingering here when its
body is destroyed. A sad and painful existence, I think it would
be; less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost..." The old
wizard's eyes were locked on Harry, who gazed back with his eyes
narrowed. "It would take time for that mutilated soul to regain a
mockery of life. That is why we have had our ten-year reprieve, I
believe; why Voldemort did not return at once. But in time... that
revenant would become capable of rising again." The old wizard
spoke with grim precision. "It is clear, from the stories, that the
Dark Lords who return by possessing another's form, wield lesser
magics than they once knew. I do not think Voldemort would be
satisfied with that. He would take some other avenue to life. But
Voldemort was more Slytherin than Salazar, grasping at every
opportunity. He would <em>use</em> his pitiful state, <em>use</em>
his power of possession, if he had reason. If he could benefit by
another's... inexplicable fury." Albus's voice had fallen to almost
a whisper. "That is what I suspect happened to Miss Granger."</p>
<p>Minerva's throat was very dry. "He's <em>here,</em>" she gasped.
"<em>Here,</em> in <em>Hogwarts</em> -"</p>
<p>Then she stopped, because the <em>reason</em> Voldemort had come
to Hogwarts -</p>
<p>The old wizard glanced at her only briefly, and said, still in
that whisper, "I am sorry, Minerva, you were right."</p>
<p>Harry's voice was edged. "Right about what?"</p>
<p>"Voldemort's strongest avenue to life," Dumbledore said heavily.
"The most desirable road for him, by which he would rise greater
and more terrible than ever before. It is guarded here, within this
castle -"</p>
<p>"Excuse me," Harry said politely. "Are you stupid?"</p>
<p>"Harry," she said, but there was no force in her voice.</p>
<p>"I mean, maybe you haven't noticed this, Headmaster Dumbledore,
but this castle is full of <em>CHILDREN -</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>I had no choice!</em> " bellowed Dumbledore. The blue eyes
were blazing now, beneath the half-moon spectacles. "I do not
<em>own</em> it, that thing which Voldemort desires. It belongs to
another, and is held here by <em>his</em> consent! I <em>asked</em>
if it could be kept in the Department of Mysteries. But <em>he</em>
would not permit that - he said it must be within the wards of
Hogwarts, in the place of the Founders' protection -" Dumbledore
passed his hand across his forehead. "No," the old wizard said in a
quieter voice. "I cannot pass this blame to him. He is right. There
is too much power in that thing, too much that men desire. I agreed
that the trap should be laid behind the wards of Hogwarts, in the
place of my own power." The old wizard bowed his head. "I knew
Voldemort would worm his way here somehow, and planned to trap him.
I did not think - I did not dream - that he would tarry in an enemy
fortress one minute longer than he must."</p>
<p>"But," said Severus in some puzzlement, "what would the Dark
Lord possibly gain by killing Lucius's only heir?"</p>
<p>"Point of order," Harry Potter said, a hard edge in his voice.
"The motives of whoever's behind this are not the primary issue.
Our top priority at this point is that an innocent Hogwarts student
is in <em>trouble!</em> "</p>
<p>The green eyes locked with the blue, as Albus Dumbledore gazed
back at the Boy-Who-Lived -</p>
<p>"Quite right, Mr. Potter," Minerva said, she hadn't even thought
about it, the words just seemed to pop out of her lips. "Albus, who
is watching over Miss Granger now?"</p>
<p>"Professor Flitwick has gone to her," the Headmaster said.</p>
<p>"She needs a <em>lawyer,</em>" Harry said. "Anyone who just
blurts out 'I did it' to the police -"</p>
<p>"Unfortunately," Minerva said, her tone taking on some of
Professor McGonagall's sternness without thinking, "I doubt an
attorney will be any use to Miss Granger at this point, Mr. Potter.
She is to face the judgment of the Wizengamot, and they would be
exceedingly unlikely to free her on a technicality."</p>
<p>Harry was looking at her with an utterly incredulous expression,
as though suggesting that Hermione Granger didn't need an attorney
was akin to suggesting that she be set on fire.</p>
<p>"She is correct, Mr. Potter," Severus said quietly. "Few court
processes in this country involve solicitors."</p>
<p>Harry lifted his glasses and rubbed his eyes, briefly. "Fine.
How do we get Hermione off the hook, exactly? I suppose it's too
much to hope that with all the lawyers gone, the judges understand
the concept of 'common sense' and 'prior probability' well enough
to realize that twelve-year-old girls basically never commit
cold-blooded murders?"</p>
<p>"It is the Wizengamot that she faces," said Severus. "The oldest
Noble Houses, and certain other wizards of influence." Severus's
face twisted in something approaching his customary sarcasm. "As
for them showing common sense - you might as well expect them to
make you a bacon sandwich, Potter."</p>
<p>Harry nodded, his mouth set. "Exactly what sort of penalty is
Hermione facing? Snapped wand and expulsion -"</p>
<p>"No," Severus said. "Nothing that light. Are you willfully
misunderstanding, Potter? She is facing the <em>Wizengamot</em>.
There is no set penalty. There is only the vote."</p>
<p>Harry Potter murmured, "<em>The rule of law, in complex times,
has proved itself deficient; we much prefer the rule of men, it's
vastly more efficient...</em> There's no constraining legal rules
at all, then?"</p>
<p>Light glinted off the old wizard's half-moon glasses; he spoke
carefully, and not without anger. "Legally, Harry, we are dealing
with a blood debt from Hermione Granger to the House of Malfoy. The
Lord of Malfoy proposes a repayment of that debt, and then the
Wizengamot votes on his proposal. That is all."</p>
<p>"But..." Harry said slowly. "Lucius was Sorted into Slytherin,
he's <em>got</em> to realize that Hermione was just a pawn. Not the
one he should actually be angry at. Right?"</p>
<p>"No, Harry Potter," Albus Dumbledore said heavily. "That is how
you <em>wish</em> Lucius Malfoy would think. Lucius Malfoy
himself... will not share your desire that he think that way."</p>
<p>Harry gazed at the Headmaster, his eyes growing colder, at the
same time that Minerva herself had to clamp down harder on her own
emotions, stop her pacing and try to breathe. She'd been trying not
to think about it, trying to turn her thoughts away from it, but
she knew. She'd known since the instant she'd heard. She could see
it in Albus's eyes -</p>
<p>"Is she facing capital punishment?" Harry said quietly, and
chills went all the way down Minerva's spine at the undertones of
that voice.</p>
<p>"No!" Albus said. "No, not the Kiss, not Azkaban, not for a
first-year in Hogwarts. Our country is not so lost, not yet."</p>
<p>"But Lucius Malfoy," Severus said tonelessly, "certainly will
not be satisfied with only snapping her wand."</p>
<p>"All right," Harry said commandingly. "As I see it, we've got
two essential lines of attack. Line one, find the real culprit.
Line two, other leverage over Lucius. Professor Quirrell saved
Draco's life, does that create a blood debt from House Malfoy to
him that he could redeem to cancel Hermione's?"</p>
<p>Minerva blinked in startlement again.</p>
<p>"No," Dumbledore said. The old wizard shook his head. "It was a
clever thought - but no, Harry, I'm afraid not. There is an
exception when the Wizengamot suspects that the circumstances of a
life-debt may have been created deliberately. And the Defense
Professor is hardly above suspicion. Thus Lucius would argue."</p>
<p>Harry nodded once, face set. "Headmaster, I know I said I
wouldn't - but under the circumstances - that time Draco cast that
torture hex on me, is that debt enough -"</p>
<p>"No," the old wizard said (even as she blurted "<em>What?</em> "
and Severus lifted an eyebrow). "It would not have been enough, and
now it is no debt at all. You are an Occlumens and cannot testify
under Veritaserum. Draco Malfoy could be Obliviated of his own
memory before he could testify -" Albus hesitated. "Harry...
whatever you have done with Draco, you must assume that Lucius
Malfoy will soon know of it."</p>
<p>Harry's head sank into his hands. "He'll give Draco
Veritaserum."</p>
<p>"Yes," Albus said quietly.</p>
<p>The Boy-Who-Lived didn't say anything, as he sat with his head
in his hands.</p>
<p>The Potions Master looked genuinely shocked. "Draco really
<em>was</em> trying to help Miss Granger," Severus said. "You -
Potter, you <em>actually -</em>"</p>
<p>"Turned him?" Harry said from between his hands. "I was about
three-quarters done. Taught him the Patronus Charm and everything.
I don't know what will happen now, though."</p>
<p>"Voldemort has struck a grave blow against us, this day," Albus
said. The sound of old wizard's voice was like the look of the boy
with his head in his hands. "He has taken two of our pieces, with
one... No. I should have seen it earlier. He has taken two of
<em>Harry's</em> pieces with one move. Voldemort has begun his game
again, not against myself, but against <em>Harry</em>. Voldemort
knows the prophecy, he knows who his last foe shall be. He is not
waiting to face Hermione Granger and Draco Malfoy at Harry's side
when they are grown. He is striking at them <em>now</em>."</p>
<p>"Maybe it's You-Know-Who and maybe it isn't," Harry said, his
voice sounding a little unsteady. "Let's not narrow down the
hypothesis space prematurely." Harry took a breath and lowered his
hands. "The other thing we can try is to nail the real culprit
before the trial - or at least find solid evidence that
<em>someone</em> else did it."</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter," said Minerva, "Professor Quirrell told the Aurors
that he knew of someone with a motive to harm Mr. Malfoy. Do
<em>you</em> know who he was talking about?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said, after a hesitation. "But I think I shall
conduct that part of my investigation with the Defense Professor -
just as I would not have Professor Quirrell in the room while we
were discussing how to investigate <em>him.</em>"</p>
<p>"He suspects me?" Severus said, then gave a short laugh. "Why,
of course he does."</p>
<p>"My own plan," said Harry, "is to go look at the trophy room
where the supposed duel took place and see if I can discover
anything anomalous. If you can tell the investigating Aurors to let
me through -"</p>
<p>"What investigating Aurors?" Severus said tonelessly.</p>
<p>Harry Potter took a deep breath, slowly let it out, and then
spoke again. "In mystery books it usually takes longer than one day
to solve a crime, but twenty-four hours is - no, <em>thirty</em>
hours is eighteen hundred minutes. And I can think of at least one
other important place to look for clues - though it'll have to be
someone who can get into the Ravenclaw girls' dorm. Back when
Hermione was fighting bullies, she was finding notes under her
pillow each morning, telling her where to go -"</p>
<p>"<em>Albus...</em>" ground out Minerva.</p>
<p>"I did not send them," said the old wizard. His white eyebrows
had lifted in surprise. "I knew nothing of this. You think she was
being played, Harry?"</p>
<p>"It's a possibility," Harry said. "More so, because there's a
part of this puzzle that you don't know about yet." Harry's voice
lowered, grew more intense. "Headmaster, you already know that I
got my father's invisibility cloak from someone who left a note
under my pillow, saying it was an early Christmas present. I think
we have to assume that's the same person who left notes for
Hermione -"</p>
<p>"Harry," the old wizard said, and hesitated momentarily.
"Returning your father's cloak to you, does not seem to me like the
act of a villain -"</p>
<p>"<em>Listen</em>," Harry Potter said urgently. "The part you
<em>don't</em> know is that after Bellatrix Black escaped from
Azkaban, I found another note under my pillow, signed 'Santa
Claus', saying that they'd heard you were shutting me up inside
Hogwarts, and that they were giving me an escape route to the Salem
Witches' Institute in America. That note came with a deck of cards,
in which the King of Hearts was supposedly a portkey -"</p>
<p>"<em>Mr. Potter!</em> " cried Professor McGonagall, she hadn't
even thought before she spoke. "That could well be a <em>kidnapping
attempt!</em> You should have told - "</p>
<p>"<em>Yes</em>, Professor, I did the sensible thing," the boy
said levelly. "As <em>adapted to the circumstances</em>, I did the
sensible thing. I told Professor Quirrell. And according to
Professor Quirrell, that portkey goes to somewhere in London - it's
definitely not strong enough to be an international portkey. Now
it's <em>possible</em> that the person who sent the note is honest,
and that the point in London is just a way station." The boy
reached into his robes and took out a deck of cards, along with a
folded paper note. "I will trust you <em>not</em> to go in guns
blazing - I mean wands blazing - just in case the sender is an ally
of mine, if not yours. But if this is a trap, I say we spring it
<em>now</em>. And whoever it is, take them <em>alive</em> so we can
exhibit them before the Wizengamot, I cannot overemphasize that
part."</p>
<p>Severus rose from his chair, his eyes now intent, and moved
toward Harry. "I'll need a hair of yours for Polyjuice, Mr. Potter
-"</p>
<p>"Let us not be hasty!" said Albus. "We have not yet examined the
notes sent to Miss Granger; there may be no resemblance after all.
Severus, would you enter her dorm room and see if you can find
those?"</p>
<p>Harry Potter's eyebrows had raised, even as he stood to offer
the Potions Master better access to his mess of hair. "You think
two <em>different</em> people are running around Hogwarts leaving
notes beneath pillows?"</p>
<p>Severus gave a brief sardonic laugh, as his hand moved forward
and plucked a hair, which soon was being carefully wrapped in silk.
"Quite possibly. If I have learned anything in my tenure as Head of
Slytherin, I have learned what ridiculous messes arise when there
is more than one plotter and more than one plan. But Headmaster - I
think Mr. Potter is correct that I should follow this portkey and
see where it leads."</p>
<p>Albus hesitated, and then nodded reluctantly. "I will speak to
you before you go, then."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Even as Harry Potter left the room for his own investigations,
Severus spun on his heel and strode swiftly toward the jar of Floo
powder, his cloak rising behind him with his speed. "I'll get some
raw Polyjuice, add the hair, and go. Headmaster, will you stand by
to -"</p>
<p>"Albus," Minerva said, surprised at how steady her own voice
was, "did you leave those notes under Mr. Potter's pillow?"</p>
<p>Severus's hand halted an instant before casting Floo powder into
the fire.</p>
<p>Dumbledore nodded to her, though the accompanying smile seemed a
bit hollow. "You know me far too well, my dear."</p>
<p>"And I suppose the portkey goes to a friendly home where Mr.
Potter would be kept safe and sound until you arrived to pick him
up and return him to Hogwarts?" Her voice tight - it was sensible,
she could not deny it was sensible, but somehow it seemed a little
cruel.</p>
<p>"It would depend on the circumstances," the old wizard said
quietly. "If Harry had gone so far - I might have let him make good
his escape, for a time. Better to know where he was going, and
ensure it was somewhere safe, with friends -"</p>
<p>"And to think," said Professor McGonagall, "that I had thought
to reprimand Mr. Potter for not telling us about this important
matter! Upbraid him for not having the sense to trust us!" Her
voice had risen in volume. "I shall skip that lecture, I
suppose!"</p>
<p>Severus was gazing at the Headmaster with narrowed eyes. "And
the notes to Miss Granger -"</p>
<p>"The Defense Professor, very likely," the old wizard said.
"Still - that is only a guess."</p>
<p>"I shall go look for them," Severus said. "And then, I suppose,
start looking for You-Know-Who." A frown crossed the Potions
Master's face. "A task at which I haven't the faintest idea of
where to start. Do you know of any magics to find a soul,
Headmaster?"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The Divination classroom was lit by the dim red light of a
hundred small fires where burned a hundred kinds of incense, so
that if you were to ask in one word what the room looked like, the
answer would be 'smoke'. (Assuming you bothered to look at
anything, when your nose was threatening to overload and die.) If
your gaze could pierce those dank mists, you would see a tiny,
cluttered room in which forty stuffed armchairs, most of them
unused, were crammed around a small open space in the center of the
room, where a circular trapdoor waited on your escape.</p>
<p>"The grim!" Professor Trelawney said in a quavering voice, as
she peered into George Weasley's teacup. "The grim! It is a sign of
death! One whom you know, George - someone you know is to die! And
soon - yes, it shall be quite soon, I think - unless of course it
is later -"</p>
<p>It would have been a good deal scarier, thought Fred and George,
if she hadn't said the same thing to every single other student in
their Divination class. They were hardly even thinking about it at
this point; all their thoughts were on today's disaster -</p>
<p>The trapdoor in the floor flew open with a bang that caused
Professor Trelawney to shriek and spill George's tea all over his
robes, and then an instant later Dumbledore was whooshing up out of
the floor with a bird of fire upon his shoulder.</p>
<p>"Fred!" the old wizard said commandingly. His robes were the
black of a moonless night, his eyes hard like blue diamonds.
"George! With me, now!"</p>
<p>There was an collective gasp and by the time Fred and George
were climbing down the ladder after the Headmaster, the entire
class was already speculating what role they'd played in the
attempted murder of Draco Malfoy.</p>
<p>The trapdoor had hardly slammed shut above them before all
nearby sounds muted and the old wizard spun on them and held out a
hand and commanded, "Give me the map!"</p>
<p>"M-map?" said Fred or George in total shock. They'd never even
suspected that Dumbledore suspected. "Why, w-we don't know what
you're -"</p>
<p>"Hermione Granger is in trouble," said the old wizard.</p>
<p>"The Map is in our dorm," George or Fred said immediately. "Just
give us a few minutes to get it and we'll -"</p>
<p>The wizard's arms swept them up as if they were hugging-pillows,
there was a piercing cry and a flash of fire and then the three of
them were in the third-year Gryffindor's boys' dorm.</p>
<p>A few moments later, Fred and George were handing over the Map
to the Headmaster, wincing only slightly at the sacrilege of giving
their precious piece of the Hogwarts security system to the person
who actually owned it, and the old wizard was frowning at the
apparent blankness.</p>
<p>"You've got to say," they explained, "<em>I solemnly swear that
I am up to no good -</em>"</p>
<p>"I decline to lie," said the old wizard. He held the Map high
and bellowed, "Hear me, Hogwarts! <em>Deligitor prodi!</em> " An
instant later the Headmaster was wearing the Sorting Hat, which
looked <em>scarily right</em> upon his head, as though Dumbledore
had always been waiting for a patchwork pointed hat to complete his
existence.</p>
<p>(Fred and George immediately memorized this phrase, just in case
it would work for somebody besides the Headmaster, and began trying
to think of pranks that would involve the Sorting Hat.)</p>
<p>The old wizard wasted not a moment before sweeping the Sorting
Hat off his head and turning it upside-down - it was hard to tell
with the Hat upside-down, but it looked a bit cross at the
treatment - and then plunged in his hand and drew out a crystal
rod. With this instrument he began tracing rune-like patterns on
the Map, muttering strange incantations that sounded not quite like
Latin and echoed in their ears in an unusually creepy fashion. In
the midst of tracing one rune he looked up at both of them, fixing
them with a sharp glare. "I will return this to you later, sons of
Weasley. Go back to class."</p>
<p>"Yes, Headmaster," they said, and hesitated. "Ah - about
Hermione Granger, is she really going to be bound to serve Draco
Malfoy forever as his -"</p>
<p>"<em>Go,</em>" said the old wizard.</p>
<p>They went.</p>
<p>When he was alone in the room, the old wizard looked down at the
map, which had now written upon itself a fine line drawing of the
Gryffindor dorms in which they stood, the small handwritten
<em>Albus P.W.B. Dumbledore</em> the only name left therein.</p>
<p>The old wizard smoothed the map, bent over it, and whispered,
"Find Tom Riddle."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The interrogation room at the Department of Magical Law
Enforcement was usually lit by a small orange light, so that the
Auror interrogating you would be leaning toward your uncomfortable
metal chair with most of their face in shadow, preventing you from
reading their expression, even as they read yours.</p>
<p>As soon as Mr. Quirrell had entered the room, the small orange
light had dimmed and begun flickering like a candle about to be
blown out by the wind. The room was now lit by a sourceless
ice-colored glow which illuminated all of Mr. Quirrell's pale skin
like alabaster, except, somehow, his eyes, which stayed in
darkness.</p>
<p>The Auror on duty outside had surreptitiously tried to dispel
this effect four times without the slightest success, despite the
fact that Mr. Quirrell had politely surrendered his wand upon being
detained for interrogation, and had shown no sign of speaking any
incantations nor exerting any other power.</p>
<p>"Quirinus... Quirrell," drawled the man now sitting across from
where the Defense Professor had waited courteously. The
interrogator had tawny hair that swept back like a lion's mane,
with yellowish eyes set into the sternly lined face of a man late
in his tenth decade. The man was, at this moment, leafing through a
large folder of parchments that he had taken from a black and very
solid-looking briefcase after he had limped into the room and sat
down, seeming not to look at the face of the man he was
interrogating. He had not introduced himself.</p>
<p>After some further leafing through parchments, carried out in
silence, the Auror spoke again. "Born the 26th of September, 1955,
to Quondia Quirrell, of an acknowledged tryst with Lirinus
Lumblung..." intoned the Auror. "Sorted into Ravenclaw... O.W.L.S.
quite good... N.E.W.T.S. in Charms, Transfiguration... an
Outstanding in Muggle Studies, impressive... Ancient Runes, and ah
yes, Defense. An Outstanding in that as well. Went on to become
quite the tourist, visiting all sorts of places. Portkey visas for
Transylvania, the Forbidden Empire, the City of Endless Night... my
my, <em>Texas</em>." The man looked up from the portfolio, eyes
narrowed. "What were you doing <em>there</em>, Mr. Quirrell?"</p>
<p>"Sightseeing, mostly in the Muggle areas," the Defense Professor
said easily. "As you say, I am quite the tourist."</p>
<p>The man listened to this with a frown, then looked back down,
then up again. "I also see that you visited Fuyuki City in
1983."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor lifted an eyebrow in mild puzzlement.
"What of it?"</p>
<p>"What did you do in Fuyuki City?" The question snapped out
razor-sharp.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor frowned slightly. "Nothing of any account.
I visited some better-known sights, some less-known sights, and
aside from that, kept to myself."</p>
<p>"Really?" the Auror said softly. "I find that reply rather
interesting."</p>
<p>"How so?" said the Defense Professor.</p>
<p>"Because there was no visa listed for Fuyuki City." The man
slammed the folder shut. "You're not Quirinus Quirrell. Who the
<em>hell</em> are you?"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The Potions Master walked quietly into the Ravenclaw girls'
dorm, the first-year dorm room, a festive place where bronze and
blue competed to be the color of stuffed animals, scarves and
dresses, small bits of inexpensive jewelry, and posters of famous
people. Hermione Granger's bed was easy to identify; it was the one
that had been attacked by a book monster.</p>
<p>Nobody else seemed to be around, at that time of day, and a
number of spells verified this.</p>
<p>The Potions Master searched under Hermione Granger's pillow, and
beneath her bed, and then began going through her trunk, sorting
through mentionable and unmentionable items without change of
expression, and finally succeeded in drawing forth a set of papers
describing places and times where bullies would be found, all of
the papers signed only with an elaborate 'S'.</p>
<p>A brief burst of fire later, the papers were gone, and the
Potions Master left to report the failure of his mission.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The Defense Professor was sitting calmly with his hands still
folded in his lap. "If you consult Headmaster Dumbledore," said the
Defense Professor, "you will find that he is well aware of this
matter, and that I agreed to teach his Defense class on the
explicit condition that no inquiry be made into my -"</p>
<p>In a lightning motion, the interrogator whipped out his wand and
spat "<em>Polyfluis Reverso!</em> " at the same time that the
Defense Professor sneezed, which somehow caused the mirror-silvered
ray to disrupt in a shower of white sparks.</p>
<p>"Pardon me," the Defense Professor said politely.</p>
<p>The smile that the Auror gave had absolutely no mirth in it. "So
where's the real Quirinus Quirrell, eh? Under an Imperius in the
bottom of a trunk somewhere, while you take a hair now and then for
your illegal Polyjuice?"</p>
<p>"You are making highly questionable assumptions," the Defense
Professor said with an edged voice. "What makes you think I did not
steal his body outright using incredibly Dark magic?"</p>
<p>This was followed by a certain pause.</p>
<p>"I suggest," the Auror said, "that you take this seriously, Mr.
Whoever-You-Are."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," said the Defense Professor, leaning back in his
chair, "but I see little reason to humble myself on this particular
occasion. What are you going to do, kill me?"</p>
<p>"I don't appreciate your humor," the Auror said softly.</p>
<p>"How unfortunate for you, Rufus Scrimgeour," said the Defense
Professor. "You have my deepest sympathy." He tilted his head,
seeming to study the interrogator; and even within the shadow of
the ice-light, the eyes glinted.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Padma stared down at her plate.</p>
<p>"Hermione wouldn't just <em>do</em> that!" yelled Mandy
Brocklehurst, who was practically in tears, in fact she
<em>was</em> in tears, her voice would have been loud enough to
silence the Great Hall if it hadn't been for all the other students
also screaming at each other. "I - I bet Malfoy tried to - to
<em>do</em> things to her -"</p>
<p>"Our General would <em>never</em> do that!" Kevin Entwhistle
yelled even louder than Mandy.</p>
<p>"Of course he would!" shouted Anthony Goldstein. "Malfoy's the
son of a <em>Death Eater!</em> "</p>
<p>Padma stared down at her plate.</p>
<p>Draco was the General of her army.</p>
<p>Hermione was the founder of S.P.H.E.W.</p>
<p>Draco had trusted her to be his second-in-command.</p>
<p>Hermione was her fellow Ravenclaw.</p>
<p>Both of them were her friends, maybe the two best friends she
had.</p>
<p>Padma stared down at her plate. She was glad the Sorting Hat
hadn't offered her Hufflepuff. If she'd been Sorted into Hufflepuff
it would probably have been much more painful, trying to decide
where her divided loyalties lay...</p>
<p>She blinked and realized that her vision had gotten blurry
again, and raised a trembling hand to wipe once more at her
eyes.</p>
<p>Morag MacDougal snorted so loudly it was audible even amid the
pandemonium of lunch, and said in a loud voice, "I bet Granger
<em>cheated</em> in her battle yesterday, I bet that's why Malfoy
challenged her <em>-</em>"</p>
<p>"All of you <em>SHUT UP!</em> " roared Harry Potter, as he hit
the table with his fists so hard that plates rattled all the way
along it.</p>
<p>At any other time it would have gotten Professors reprimanding
him, this time it just got a few nearby students to look.</p>
<p>"I'd wanted to eat lunch," Harry Potter said, "and then get back
to investigating, so I wasn't going to talk. But you're all being
<em>silly</em>, and when the truth comes out you're going to regret
what you said about innocent people. Draco didn't do anything,
Hermione didn't do anything, they were both False-Memory-Charmed!"
Harry Potter's voice had been rising on the last words. "<em>How is
that not BLOODY OBVIOUS?</em> "</p>
<p>"You think we'll believe <em>that?</em> " Kevin Entwhistle
yelled right back at him. "That's what everyone says! 'I didn't do
it, it was all just a False Memory Charm!' You think we're
<em>stupid?</em> "</p>
<p>And Morag nodded right along with him, with a condescending
look.</p>
<p>The look that came over Harry Potter's face then made Padma
flinch.</p>
<p>"I see," Harry Potter said, it wasn't a shout so Padma had to
strain to hear it. "Professor Quirrell isn't here to explain to me
how stupid people are, but I bet this time I can get it on my own.
People do something dumb and get caught and are given Veritaserum.
Not romantic master criminals, because <em>they</em> wouldn't get
caught, <em>they</em> would have learned Occlumency. Sad, pathetic,
incompetent criminals get caught, and confess under Veritaserum,
and they're desperate to stay out of Azkaban so they say they were
False-Memory-Charmed. Right? So your brain, by sheer Pavlovian
association, links the idea of False Memory Charms to pathetic
criminals with unbelievable excuses. You don't have to consider the
specific details, your brain just <em>pattern-matches</em> the
hypothesis into a bucket of things you don't believe, and you're
done. Just like my father thought that magical hypotheses could
never be believed, because he'd heard so many stupid people talking
about magic. Believing a hypothesis that involves False Memory
Charms is <em>low-status</em>."</p>
<p>"What are you <em>blithering</em> about?" said Morag, looking
down her nose at the Boy-Who-Lived.</p>
<p>"You think we'd believe anything <em>you</em> say?" yelled a
slightly older-looking Ravenclaw witch who Padma didn't recognize.
"When <em>you</em> turned Granger Dark?"</p>
<p>"And I'm not going to complain," Harry Potter said in an eerily
calm voice, "about wizards not having any logic and believing the
craziest things. Because I said that to Professor Quirrell once,
and he just gave me this <em>look</em> and said that if I wasn't
blinded by my upbringing I could think of a hundred more ridiculous
things that lots of Muggles believe. What you're all doing is very
human and very normal and doesn't make you <em>unusually</em> bad
people, so I'm not going to complain." The Boy-Who-Lived rose up
from his bench. "I'll see you all later."</p>
<p>And Harry Potter walked away from them, walked away from all of
them.</p>
<p>"You're not thinking he's <em>right,</em> are you?" said Su Li
from beside her, in a tone which made it clear what <em>she</em>
thought.</p>
<p>"I -" said Padma. Her words seemed to be caught in her throat,
her thoughts seemed to be caught in her head. "I - I mean - I
-"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>If you think hard enough you can do the impossible.</p>
<p>(It had always been an article of faith with Harry. There'd been
a time when he'd acknowledged the laws of physics as ultimate
limitations, and now he suspected there were no true limits at
all.)</p>
<p>If you think <em>fast</em> enough you can sometimes do the
impossible <em>quickly</em>...</p>
<p>...sometimes.</p>
<p>Only sometimes.</p>
<p>Not always.</p>
<p>Not <em>reliably</em>.</p>
<p>The Boy-Who-Lived stared around the trophy room, surrounded by
awards and cups and plates and shields and statues and medals kept
behind thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, of crystal glass
displays. For as many centuries as Hogwarts had existed, this room
had been accumulating details. A week, a month, maybe even a year,
wouldn't have sufficed to take the 'examine' option on every item
in the room. With Professor Flitwick gone, Harry had asked
Professor Vector if there was any way to detect damage to the wards
around the crystal cases, verify the residue that a real duel
should have left behind. Harry had raced through the Hogwarts
library looking for spells to tell the difference between old
fingerprints and new fingerprints, or to detect lingering
exhalations in a room. And all those attempts at playing detective
had failed.</p>
<p>There were no clues, none that he was smart enough to find.</p>
<p>Professor Snape had said that the portkey led to an empty house
in London, with no sign of anyone or anything else.</p>
<p>Professor Snape hadn't found any notes in Hermione's dorm.</p>
<p>Headmaster Dumbledore had said that Voldemort's spirit was
probably hiding out in the Chamber of Secrets where the Hogwarts
security system couldn't find him. Harry had snuck into the
Slytherin dungeons under the Cloak of Invisibility and spent the
rest of the afternoon looking through all the obvious places, but
he hadn't found anything snaky that answered back when spoken to.
The entrance to the Chamber of Secrets, it seemed, hadn't been
meant to be found in a day.</p>
<p>Harry had talked to all of Hermione's friends that would still
talk to him, and none of them had remembered Hermione saying
anything specific about why she'd believed that Draco was plotting
against her.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell hadn't come back from the Ministry as of
dinnertime. The older students seemed to think that this year's
Defense Professor would probably end up being blamed for the
incident, and fired for teaching Hogwarts students to be too
violent. They'd talked about the Defense Professor as though he
were already gone.</p>
<p>Harry had used up all six hours from his Time-Turner, and there
were still no clues, and he had to go to sleep now if he wanted to
be functional at Hermione's trial the next day.</p>
<p>The Boy-Who-Destroyed-A-Dementor was standing in the middle of
the Hogwarts trophy room, his wand dropped at his feet.</p>
<p>He was crying.</p>
<p>Sometimes you call your brain and it doesn't answer.</p>
<p>The trial of Hermione Granger started on schedule the next
day.</p>
</div>
<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 76: Interlude with the Confessor:
Sunk Costs<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>Rianne Felthorne descended the stairs of roughened stone and
crude mortar, keeping a <em>Lumos</em> lit through the distances
between fire-sconces, holding aloft her wand through the gaps from
light to light.</p>
<p>She came to the empty rock cavern pierced by many dark openings,
lit by a torch of ancient style that fired as she entered.</p>
<p>There was no one else there, as yet, and after long minutes of
nervous standing, she began the spell to Transfigure a cushioned
sofa large enough for two people to sit, or maybe even lie down on.
A simple wooden stool would have been easier, she could have done
that in fifteen seconds, but - well -</p>
<p>Even when the sofa was fully conjured, Professor Snape still
hadn't arrived, and she sat down on the left side of her sofa with
her pulse hammering in her throat. Somehow she was only becoming
more nervous, not less, as the delay stretched.</p>
<p>She knew this was the last time.</p>
<p>The last time before all these memories went away, and Rianne
Felthorne found herself in a mysterious cavern, wondering what was
going on.</p>
<p>There was something about it that felt like dying.</p>
<p>The books said a properly done Obliviation wasn't harmful,
people forgot things all the time. People dreamed, and then woke up
without remembering their dreams. Obliviation didn't even involve
that much discontinuity, just a brief instant of disorientation; it
was like being distracted by a loud noise and losing track of a
thought you couldn't seem to remember afterward. That was what the
books said, and why Memory Charms were fully approved by the
Ministry for all authorized governmental purposes.</p>
<p>But still, <em>these thoughts,</em> the thoughts she was
thinking right now; soon nobody would have them anymore. When she
looked ahead in the future, there was nobody to complete the
thoughts she wasn't finished thinking. Even if she managed to tie
up all the loose ends in her mind over the next minute, there
wouldn't be anything left of it afterward. Wasn't that exactly what
you would find yourself reflecting on, if you were going to die in
the next minute?</p>
<p>There came the sound of muffled steps...</p>
<p>Severus Snape emerged into the cavern.</p>
<p>His eyes moved to her sitting on the sofa, and a strange
expression crossed his face; strange because it wasn't sardonic, or
angry, or cold.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Miss Felthorne," Snape said quietly, "that was
considerate of you." The Potions Master took out his wand and
performed the usual privacy Charms, and then he moved toward her,
and sat down heavily beside her on the Transfigured sofa.</p>
<p>Her pulse was now pounding for another reason entirely.</p>
<p>She slowly turned to look at Professor Snape, and saw that his
head was leaning back against the sofa, and his eyes were closed.
Not sleeping, though. His face appeared tense, unrelaxed, bearing
pain.</p>
<p>She knew - she was suddenly certain - that she was only allowed
to see this sight because she wouldn't remember it afterward; and
that nobody before her had ever been allowed to see it.</p>
<p>The frantic conversation going on inside Rianne Felthorne's mind
sounded something like this: <em>I could just lean over and kiss
him, you are completely out of your tiny mind, his eyes are closed
I bet he wouldn't stop me in time, I bet it would be years before
anyone found your body -</em></p>
<p>But Professor Snape opened his eyes then (to her inner
disappointment and relief), and said, in a more normal voice, "Your
payment, Miss Felthorne." From his robe he took a ruby, cut to
Gringotts standard, and held it out toward her. "Fifty facets. I
will not mind if you count them."</p>
<p>She held out a trembling hand, hoping that Snape would press the
ruby into her fingers, that she would feel a touch of his skin
alive against hers -</p>
<p>But instead Snape raised his hand slightly and dropped the ruby
into her hand, then leaned back against the couch. "You will
remember finding it lying on the ground of this cavern, where you
came exploring," said Snape. "And since nobody except you will
actually believe that, you will remember thinking that it would be
less troublesome if you deposited the money into a separate box in
Gringotts."</p>
<p>For a stretch there was only the faint crackling of the
torch.</p>
<p>"Why -" Rianne Felthorne said. <em>He knows I won't
remember.</em> "Why <em>did</em> you do it? I mean - you said to
tell you where bullies would be, and who they would be, but not
whether Granger would be there. And I know, the way the Time-Turner
works, if you want to <em>make</em> Granger be there, you can't be
told whether it's already happened. So I did work out that
<em>we</em> were the ones telling her where to go. We were, weren't
we?"</p>
<p>Snape nodded without speaking. He had closed his eyes again.</p>
<p>"But," said Rianne, "I didn't understand <em>why</em> you were
helping her. And now - after what you did to Granger in the Great
Hall - I just don't understand at all." Rianne had never thought of
herself as particularly nice. She'd taken little notice of the
controversy over the Sunshine General. But something about
<em>helping</em> Granger fight bullies had... well, she'd gotten
used to thinking of that as the good side, and thinking of
<em>herself</em> as being on the good side. And she'd found she
actually liked it. It was hard, to just let that go. "Why'd you do
that, Professor Snape?"</p>
<p>Snape shook his head, his face tightened.</p>
<p>"Is -" Rianne said falteringly. "I mean - so long as we're here
- is there anything you do want to talk about?" There was something
<em>she</em> wanted to say, but she couldn't make the words pass
her own lips.</p>
<p>"I can think of one matter," Snape said after a pause. "If you
are interested, Miss Felthorne."</p>
<p>Snape's eyes were still shut, so she couldn't just nod her head.
Her voice almost broke, when she forced herself to say "Yes."</p>
<p>"There's a certain boy in your class who likes you, Miss
Felthorne," Snape said from behind his closed eyes. "I won't say
his name. But he watches you every time you walk across the room,
when he thinks you aren't looking. He dreams about you and desires
to possess you, but he's never asked you for so much as a
kiss."</p>
<p>Her heart started hammering even harder.</p>
<p>"Please tell me the honest truth, Miss Felthorne. What do you
think of that boy?"</p>
<p>"Well -" she said. She was stumbling over her words. "I think -
to never even ask for one kiss - would be -"</p>
<p><em>Sad.</em></p>
<p><em>Just too p</em><em>itiful.</em></p>
<p>"Weakness," she said, her voice trembling.</p>
<p>"I agree," said Snape. "Suppose that boy had helped you, though.
Would you think that you owed him a kiss, if he asked?"</p>
<p>She inhaled sharply -</p>
<p>"Or would you think," Snape continued, his eyes still closed,
"that he was just being bothersome?"</p>
<p>The words stabbed into her like a knife and she couldn't help
gasping out loud.</p>
<p>Snape's eyes flew open, and his gaze met hers across the
sofa.</p>
<p>Then the Potions Master began to laugh, small sad chuckles.</p>
<p>"No, not <em>you,</em> Miss Felthorne!" Snape said. "Not
<em>you!</em> We really <em>are</em> talking about a boy. One who
attends your Potions class, in fact."</p>
<p>"Oh," she said. She tried to remember what Snape had said
before, now feeling rather unnerved as she thought of some boy
watching her, always silently watching. "Well, um, in that case.
That's kind of <em>creepy</em>, actually. Who is it?"</p>
<p>The Potions Master shook his head. "It doesn't matter," said
Snape. "Out of curiosity, what would you think if that boy were
still in love with you years later?"</p>
<p>"Um," she said, feeling a bit confused, "that would be totally
pathetic?"</p>
<p>The torch crackled a bit in the cavern.</p>
<p>"It's strange," Snape said quietly. "I have had two mentors,
over the course of my days. Both were extraordinarily perceptive,
and neither one ever told me the things I wasn't seeing. It's clear
enough why the first said nothing, but the second..." Snape's face
tightened. "I suppose I would have to be naive, to ask why he
stayed silent."</p>
<p>The quiet stretched, while Rianne tried frantically to think of
something to say.</p>
<p>"It is an odd thing," Snape said, his voice still softer, "to
look back after only thirty-two years, and wonder when your life
was ruined past all rescuing. Was it determined when the Sorting
Hat cried 'Slytherin!' for me? It seems unfair, since I was offered
no choice; the Sorting Hat spoke the moment it touched upon my
head. Yet I cannot claim it named me untruly. I never treasured
knowledge for its own sake. I was not loyal to the one person I
called friend. I was never one for righteous fury, then or now.
Courage? There is no bravery in risking a life already ruined. My
little fears have always mastered me, and I never turned aside from
any of the paths I walked down, for those little fears. No, the
Sorting Hat could never have put me in her House. Perhaps my final
loss was determined, even then. Is that fair, I ask, even if the
Sorting Hat speaks truly? Is it fair that some children should
possess more courage than others, and thus a man's life be
judged?"</p>
<p>Rianne Felthorne was starting to realize that she'd never had
the tiniest inkling of who her Potions Master was inside, and
unfortunately all these dark hidden depths weren't helping her with
her problem.</p>
<p>"But no," Snape said. "I know where it went wrong for the last
time. I could point to the very day and hour I missed my final
chance. Miss Felthorne, did the Sorting Hat offer you
Ravenclaw?"</p>
<p>"Y-yes," she said without thinking.</p>
<p>"Have you ever been any good at riddles?"</p>
<p>"Yes," she said again, because whatever Professor Snape was
about to say, she wouldn't hear it if she said <em>no.</em></p>
<p>"I am terrible at riddles," Snape said in a distant voice. "I
was once given a riddle to solve, and I did not understand even the
simplest part until too late. I did not even realize the riddle was
meant for <em>me</em> until too late. I thought I had merely
happened to overhear it, when in truth it was I who was overheard.
So I sold my riddle to another, and that is when the wreckage of my
life passed beyond retrieval." Snape's voice was still distant,
sounding more abstracted than sorrowful. "And even now, I
understand nothing of importance. Tell me, Miss Felthorne, suppose
a man were carrying a knife, and he tripped over a baby and stabbed
himself. Would you say that the baby had," Snape's voice lowered,
as though he were imitating some still deeper voice, "<em>THE POWER
TO VANQUISH</em> him?"</p>
<p>"Um... no?" she said hesitantly.</p>
<p>"Then what <em>does</em> it mean to have the power to vanquish
someone?"</p>
<p>Rianne considered the puzzle. (Wishing, not for the first time
in her life, that she had chosen Ravenclaw and to perdition with
her parents' disapproval; but the Sorting Hat had never offered her
Gryffindor.) "Well..." Rianne said. She was having trouble putting
her thoughts into words. "It means you've got the <em>power</em>,
but you don't <em>have</em> to do it. It means you could do it if
you tried -"</p>
<p>"Choice," the Potions Master said in the same faraway voice, as
though he wasn't really talking to her at all. "There will be a
choice. That is what the riddle seems to imply. And that choice is
not a foregone conclusion to the chooser, for the riddle does not
say, <em>will vanquish,</em> but rather <em>the power to
vanquish.</em> How would a grown man mark a baby as his equal?"</p>
<p>"What?" said Rianne. She didn't understand that at all.</p>
<p>"<em>Marking</em> a baby is simple. Any strong Dark curse would
produce a lasting scar. But such may be done to any child. What
mark would signify that a baby was your <em>equal?</em> "</p>
<p>She answered with the first thought that came to mind. "If you
signed a betrothal contract, that would mean you'd be equals with
them someday, when they grew up and you got married."</p>
<p>"That..." said Snape. "That's probably not it, Miss Felthorne,
but thank you for trying." The long delicate fingers, honed by
stirring potions to unimaginably fine tolerances, reached up and
rubbed at the temples of the man's forehead. "It is enough to drive
me to madness, so much hinging on such fragile words. Power he
knows not... it <em>must</em> be more than some unknown spell. Not
something <em>he</em> could acquire simply by practice and study.
Some innate talent? No one can learn to be a Metamorphmagus... and
yet that hardly seems like a power he <em>knows not</em>. Nor can I
see how <em>either</em> could destroy all but a remnant of the
other; I can see it in one direction, but not the reverse..." The
Potions Master sighed. "And none of this means anything to you,
does it, Miss Felthorne? The words are nothing. The words are
shadows. It is her <em>intonation</em> which carries the meaning
and that is something I've never been able to..."</p>
<p>The Potions Master trailed off, while Rianne stared at him.</p>
<p>"A <em>prophecy?</em> " Rianne said in a high squeak. "You heard
a <em>prophecy?</em> " She'd taken Divination for a couple of
months before dropping it in disgust, and she knew that much about
how it worked.</p>
<p>"I will try one last thing," said Snape. "Something I have not
tried before. Miss Felthorne, listen to the <em>sound</em> of my
voice, the <em>way</em> I say it<em>,</em> not the words
themselves, and tell me what you think it means. Can you do that?
Good," said Snape, as she nodded obediently, though she wasn't sure
at all what she was supposed to do.</p>
<p>And Severus Snape drew a breath, and intoned, "<em>FOR THOSE TWO
DIFFERENT SPELLETS CANNOT EXIST IN THE SAME VULD.</em>"</p>
<p>It sent shivers down her spine, all the worse for knowing the
hollow words had been spoken in imitation of a true prophecy.
Unnerved, she blurted out the first thing which came to mind, which
might have been influenced by her present company. "Those two
different ingredients cannot exist in the same cauldron?"</p>
<p>"But why <em>not</em>, Miss Felthorne? What is the
<em>meaning</em> of a statement like that? What are we really being
told?"</p>
<p>"Ah..." she hazarded. "If the two ingredients mix, they'll catch
fire and burn the cauldron?"</p>
<p>Snape's face did not change expression in the slightest.</p>
<p>"Perhaps," Snape finally said, after they'd sat on the sofa in
awful silence for what seemed like minutes. "It would explain the
word <em>must</em>. Thank you, Miss Felthorne. Once again you have
been most helpful."</p>
<p>"I -" she said, "I was glad to -" and the words stuck in her
throat. The Potions Master had thanked her with a tone of finality,
and she knew that the time of the Rianne Felthorne who remembered
these moments was drawing to an end. "I wish I didn't have to
forget this, Professor Snape!"</p>
<p>"I wish," Severus Snape said in a whisper so low she could
hardly hear it, "that everything had been different..."</p>
<p>The Potions Master stood up from the sofa, the weight of his
presence vanishing from beside her. He turned and drew his wand
from his robes, pointing it at her.</p>
<p>"Wait -" she said. "Before that -"</p>
<p>Somehow it was unbelievably hard to take the first step from
fantasy to reality, from imagining to doing. Even if it was only
one step and would never go any further. The gap stretched like the
distance between two mountains.</p>
<p>The Sorting Hat had never offered her Gryffindor...</p>
<p>...was it fair that thus a woman's life be judged?</p>
<p><em>If you can't</em> <em>say it now, when you won't even
remember it afterward - when nothing will continue from this
moment, just as if you were to die - then when will you ever say
it, to anyone?</em></p>
<p>"Can I have a kiss first?" said Rianne Felthorne.</p>
<p>Snape's black eyes studied her so intensely that her blush
started to reach all the way to her chest, and she wondered if he
knew perfectly well that she was still being weak, and it wasn't a
kiss she'd truly wanted.</p>
<p>"Why not," the Potions Master said quietly, and he leaned his
head down over the sofa and kissed her.</p>
<p>It was nothing like she'd imagined. In her fantasies Snape's
kisses were fierce, seized from her, but this was - it was just
<em>awkward,</em> actually. Snape's lips pressed down too hard on
hers, forcing them back against her teeth, and the angle wasn't
right and their noses were sort of bending and his lips were too
<em>tight</em> and -</p>
<p>Only as the Potions Master straightened back up again, raising
his wand once more, did she realize.</p>
<p>"That wasn't -" she said in a wondering voice, looking up at
him. "That wasn't - was it - your <em>first</em> -"</p>
<p>Rianne Felthorne blinked at the stone cavern she'd discovered,
still holding the extraordinary ruby she'd found embedded in the
dirt of one corner. It was an incredible windfall, and she didn't
know why looking at the ruby made her feel so sad, like she'd
forgotten something, something that had been precious to her.</p>

<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 81: Taboo Tradeoffs, Pt
3<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>In rising half-circles of dark stone, a great sea of upraised
hands.</p>
<p>The Lords and Ladies of the Wizengamot, in plum-colored robes
marked with a silver 'W', stared down in stern rebuke at a young
girl trembling in chains. If they had, in any particular ethical
system, damned themselves, they clearly thought quite highly of
themselves for having done so.</p>
<p>Harry's breath was trembling in his chest. His dark side had
come up with a plan - and then rotated itself back out again
because speaking too icily would not be to Hermione's advantage; a
fact which the only-half-cold Harry had somehow not realized...</p>
<p>"The vote carries, in favor," intoned the secretary, when all
the tallying was done, and the upraised hands fell back down. "The
Wizengamot recognizes the blood debt owed by Hermione Granger to
House Malfoy for the attempted murder of its scion and ending of
its line."</p>
<p>Lucius Malfoy was smiling in grim satisfaction. "And now," said
the white-maned wizard, "I say that her debt shall be paid -"</p>
<p>Harry clenched his fists beneath the bench and shouted, "By the
debt owed from House Malfoy to House Potter!"</p>
<p>"Silence!" snapped the woman in too much pink makeup sitting
next to Minister Fudge. "You've disrupted these proceedings quite
enough already! Aurors, escort him out!"</p>
<p>"Wait," said Augusta Longbottom from the top tier of seats.
"What debt is this?"</p>
<p>Lucius's hands whitened on his cane. "House Malfoy owes no debt
to you!"</p>
<p>It wasn't the world's most solid hope, it was based on one
newspaper article from a woman who'd been False-Memory-Charmed, but
Rita Skeeter had seemed to find it plausible, that Mr. Weasley had
allegedly owed James Potter a debt because...</p>
<p>"I'm surprised you've forgotten," Harry said evenly. "Surely it
was a cruel and painful period of your life, laboring under the
Imperius curse of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, until you were freed of
it by the efforts of House Potter. By my mother, Lily Potter, who
died for it, and by my father, James Potter, who died for it, and
by me, of course."</p>
<p>There was a brief silence within the Most Ancient Hall.</p>
<p>"Why, what an excellent point, Mr. Potter," said the old witch
who'd been identified as Madam Bones. "I, too, am quite surprised
that Lord Malfoy would forget such a significant event. It must
have been such a happy day for him."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Augusta Longbottom. "He must have been so
grateful."</p>
<p>Madam Bones nodded. "House Malfoy could not possibly deny that
debt - unless, perhaps, Lord Malfoy is to tell us that he has
misremembered something? I should take quite a professional
interest in that. We are always trying to improve our picture of
those dark days."</p>
<p>Lucius Malfoy's hands gripped the silver snake-handle of his
cane like he was about to strike with it, unleash whatever power it
kept -</p>
<p>Then the Lord Malfoy seemed to relax, and a chill smile came
over his face. "Of course," he said easily. "I do confess I had not
understood, but the child is quite correct. But I do not quite
think the two debts cancel - House Potter was only trying to save
itself, after all -"</p>
<p>"Not so," Dumbledore said from above.</p>
<p>"- and therefore," intoned Lucius Malfoy, "I demand monetary
compensation as well, for the redemption of the blood debt owed my
son. That, too, is the law."</p>
<p>Harry felt a strange inward flinch. That had also been in the
newspaper article, Mr. Weasley had demanded an additional ten
thousand Galleons -</p>
<p>"How much?" said the Boy-Who-Lived.</p>
<p>Lucius was still wearing the cold smile. "One hundred thousand
Galleons. If you have not that much in your vault, I suppose I must
accept a promissory note for the remainder."</p>
<p>A roar of protest went up from Dumbledore's side of the room,
even some of the plum-colored robes in the middle looked
shocked.</p>
<p>"Shall we put it to vote of the Wizengamot?" said Lucius Malfoy.
"I think few of us would like to see the little murderess go free.
By a show of hands, that additional compensation of one hundred
thousand Galleons would be required to cancel the debt!"</p>
<p>The clerk began tallying, but that vote was also clear.</p>
<p>Harry stood there, breathing deeply.</p>
<p><em>You'd better not even have to think about this,</em> Harry's
inner Gryffindor said threateningly.</p>
<p><em>It's a major purchase,</em> observed Ravenclaw. <em>We ought
to spend a lot of time thinking about it.</em></p>
<p>It shouldn't have been hard. It <em>shouldn't</em> have. Two
million pounds was only money, and money was only worth what it
could buy...</p>
<p>It was strange how much psychological attachment you could have
to 'only money', or how painful it could be to imagine losing a
bank vault full of gold that you hadn't even imagined existed just
one year earlier.</p>
<p><em>Kimball Kinnison wouldn't hesitate,</em> said Gryffindor.
<em>Seriously. Like, snap decision. What sort of hero are you? I
already hate you just for having to think about it for longer than
50 milliseconds.</em></p>
<p><em>This is real life,</em> said Ravenclaw. <em>Losing all your
money is a lot more painful for real people in real life than in
heroic books.</em></p>
<p><em>What?</em> demanded Gryffindor. <em>Whose side are you
on?</em></p>
<p><em>I wasn't advocating for a particular answer,</em> said
Ravenclaw, <em>I was just saying it because it was true.</em></p>
<p><em>Could a hundred thousand Galleons be used to save more than
one life if spent some other way?</em> said Slytherin. <em>We have
research to do, battles to fight, the difference between being
40,000 Galleons rich and being 60,000 Galleons in debt is not
trivial -</em></p>
<p><em>So we'll just use one of our ways to make money fast and
earn it all back,</em> said Hufflepuff.</p>
<p><em>It's not certain those will work,</em> said Slytherin,
<em>and a lot of them require starting cash -</em></p>
<p><em>Personally,</em> said Gryffindor, <em>I vote that we save
Hermione and then gang up and kill our inner Slytherin.</em></p>
<p>The clerk's voice said that the tally had been recorded and the
vote had passed...</p>
<p>Harry's lips opened.</p>
<p>"I accept your offer," said Harry's lips, without any
hesitation, without any decision having been made; just as if the
internal debate had been pretense and illusion, the true controller
of the voice having been no part of it.</p>
<p>Lucius Malfoy's mask of calm shattered, his eyes widened, he
stared at Harry in sheer blank astonishment. His mouth had opened
slightly, though he wasn't speaking, and if he was making any
peculiar noises it couldn't be heard over the roar of simultaneous
gasps from the Wizengamot -</p>
<p>A tap of stone silenced the crowd.</p>
<p>"No," said the voice of Dumbledore.</p>
<p>Harry's head jerked around to stare at the ancient wizard.</p>
<p>Dumbledore's lined face was pale, the silver beard was visibly
trembling, he looked like he was in the final throes of a terminal
illness. "I'm - sorry, Harry - but this choice is not yours - for I
am still the guardian of your vault."</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " said Harry, too shocked to compose his
reply.</p>
<p>"I cannot let you go into debt to Lucius Malfoy, Harry! I
cannot! You do not know - you do not realize -"</p>
<p><em>DIE.</em></p>
<p>Harry didn't even know which part of himself had spoken, it
might have been a unanimous vote, the pure rage and fury pouring
through him. For an instant he thought that the sheer force of the
anger might take magical wing and fly out to strike the Headmaster,
send him tumbling back dead from the podium -</p>
<p>But when that mental voice had spoken, the old wizard was still
standing there, gazing at Harry, long dark wand in his right hand,
short black rod in his left.</p>
<p>And Harry's eyes also went to the red-golden bird with its claws
resting on the shoulder of Dumbledore's black robes, silent when no
phoenix should have been silent. "Fawkes," Harry said, his voice
sounding strange in his own ears, "can you scream at him for
me?"</p>
<p>The fiery bird on the old wizard's shoulder didn't scream. Maybe
the Wizengamot had demanded that a spell of silence be put on the
creature, otherwise it probably would have been screaming the whole
time. But Fawkes hit his master, one golden wing buffeting the old
wizard's head.</p>
<p>"I cannot, Harry!" the old wizard said, the agony clear in his
voice. "I am doing as I must do!"</p>
<p>And Harry knew, then, as he looked at the red-golden bird, what
he had to do as well. It should have been obvious from the
beginning, that solution.</p>
<p>"Then I too will do what I must," Harry said up to Dumbledore,
as though the two of them stood alone in the room. "You do realize
that, don't you?"</p>
<p>The old wizard shook his trembling head. "You will change your
mind when you are older -"</p>
<p>"I'm not talking about that," Harry said, his voice still
strange in his own ears. "I mean that I will not allow Hermione
Granger to be eaten by Dementors under any circumstances. Period.
Regardless of what any law says, and no matter what I have to do to
stop it. Do I still need to spell it out?"</p>
<p>A strange male voice spoke from somewhere far away, "Be sure
that the girl is taken directly to Azkaban, and put under extra
guard."</p>
<p>Harry waited, staring at the old wizard, and then spoke again.
"I will go to Azkaban," Harry said to the old wizard, as though
they stood alone in the world, "before Hermione can be taken there,
and start snapping my fingers. It may cost me my life, but by the
time she gets there, there won't be an Azkaban anymore."</p>
<p>Some members of the Wizengamot gasped in surprise.</p>
<p>Then a greater number started laughing.</p>
<p>"How would you even get there, little boy?" someone said, from
among those who were laughing.</p>
<p>"I have my ways of going places," said the boy's distant voice.
Harry kept his eyes on Dumbledore, on the old wizard staring at him
in shock. Harry didn't look directly at Fawkes, didn't give his
plan away; but in his mind he prepared to summon the phoenix to
transport him, prepared to fill his mind with light and fury, to
call for the fire-bird with all his might, he might have to do it
upon the instant if Dumbledore pointed his wand -</p>
<p>"Would you truly?" the old wizard said to Harry, also as if the
two of them stood alone in the room.</p>
<p>The room went silent again as everyone stared in shock at the
Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, who seemed to be taking the mad
threat completely seriously.</p>
<p>The old wizard's eyes were locked only on Harry. "Would you risk
everything - everything - only for her?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said back in reply.</p>
<p><em>That's the wrong answer, you know,</em> said Slytherin.
<em>Seriously.</em></p>
<p><em>But it's the true answer.</em></p>
<p>"You will not see reason?" said the old wizard.</p>
<p>"Apparently not," Harry said back.</p>
<p>The gazes stayed locked.</p>
<p>"This is terrible folly," said the old wizard.</p>
<p>"I am aware of this," answered the hero. "Now get out of my
way."</p>
<p>Strange light glinted in the ancient blue eyes. "As you will,
Harry Potter, but know that this is not over."</p>
<p>The rest of the world faded back into existence.</p>
<p>"I withdraw my objection," said the old wizard, "Harry Potter
may do as he wishes," and the Wizengamot exploded in a roar of
shock, only to be silenced by a final tap of the stone rod.</p>
<p>Harry turned his head back to look at Lord Malfoy, who looked
like he'd seen a cat turn into a person and start eating other
cats. To call the look confused did not begin to describe it.</p>
<p>"You would truly..." Lucius Malfoy said slowly. "You would truly
pay a hundred thousand Galleons, to save one mudblood girl."</p>
<p>"I think there's about forty thousand in my Gringotts vault,"
Harry said. It was strange how that was <em>still</em> causing more
internal pain than the thought of taking an over-fifty-percent risk
to his life to destroy Azkaban. "As for the other sixty thousand -
what are the rules, exactly?"</p>
<p>"It comes due when you graduate Hogwarts," the old wizard said
from high above. "But Lord Malfoy has certain rights over you
before then, I fear."</p>
<p>Lucius Malfoy stood motionless, frowning down at Harry. "Who is
she to you, then? <em>What</em> is she to you, that you would pay
so much to keep her from harm?"</p>
<p>"My friend," the boy said quietly.</p>
<p>Lucius Malfoy's eyes narrowed. "By the report I received, you
cannot cast the Patronus Charm, and Dumbledore knows this. The
power of a single Dementor nearly killed you. You would not dare
venture near Azkaban in your own person -"</p>
<p>"That was in January," said Harry. "This is April."</p>
<p>Lucius Malfoy's eyes remained cool and calculating. "You pretend
you can destroy Azkaban, and Dumbledore pretends to believe
it."</p>
<p>Harry did not reply.</p>
<p>The white-haired man turned slightly, toward the center of the
half-circle, as though to address the greater Wizengamot. "I
withdraw my offer!" shouted the Lord of Malfoy. "I will not accept
the debt to House Potter in payment, not even for a hundred
thousand Galleons! The girl's blood debt to House Malfoy
stands!"</p>
<p>Again the roar of many voices. "Dishonorable!" someone cried.
"You acknowledge the debt to House Potter, and yet you would -" and
then that voice cut off.</p>
<p>"I acknowledge the debt, but the law does not strictly oblige me
to accept it in cancellation," said Lord Malfoy with a grim smile.
"The girl is no part of House Potter; the debt I owe House Potter
is no debt to her. As for the <em>dishonor</em> -" Lucius Malfoy
paused. "As for the grave shame I feel at my ingratitude toward the
Potters, who have done so much for me -" Lucius Malfoy bowed his
head. "May my ancestors forgive me."</p>
<p>"Well, boy?" called the scarred man sitting at Lord Malfoy's
right hand. "Go and destroy Azkaban, then!"</p>
<p>"I'd like to see that," said another voice. "Will you be selling
tickets?"</p>
<p>It went without saying that Harry didn't pick this particular
moment to give up.</p>
<p><em>The girl is no part of House Potter -</em></p>
<p>He had, in fact, seen the obvious way out of the dilemma almost
instantly.</p>
<p>It might have taken him longer if he hadn't recently overheard a
number of conversations between older Ravenclaw girls, and read a
certain number of Quibbler stories.</p>
<p>He was, nonetheless, having trouble accepting it.</p>
<p><em>This is ridiculous,</em> said a part of Harry which had just
dubbed itself the Internal Consistency Checker. <em>Our actions
here are completely incoherent. First you feel less emotional
reluctance to risk your bloody LIFE and probably DIE for Hermione,
than to part with a stupid heap of gold. And now you're balking
just at getting married?</em></p>
<p><em>SYSTEM ERROR.</em></p>
<p><em>You know what?</em> said Internal Consistency Checker.
<em>You're stupid.</em></p>
<p><em>I didn't say no,</em> thought Harry. <em>I was just saying
SYSTEM ERROR.</em></p>
<p><em>I vote for destroying Azkaban,</em> said Gryffindor. <em>It
needs to be done anyway.</em></p>
<p><em>Really, really stupid,</em> said Internal Consistency
Checker. <em>Oh, screw this, I'm assuming control of our
body.</em></p>
<p>The boy took a deep breath, and opened his mouth -</p>
<p>By this point Harry Potter had entirely forgotten the existence
of Professor McGonagall, who had been sitting there this whole time
undergoing a number of interesting changes of facial expression
which Harry had not been looking at because he was distracted. It
would have been overly harsh to say that Harry had forgotten her
because he did not consider her a PC. It could be more kindly said
that Professor McGonagall was not visibly a solution to any of his
current problems, and therefore she was not part of the
universe.</p>
<p>So Harry, who at this point had a fair amount of adrenaline in
his bloodstream, startled and jumped quite visibly when Professor
McGonagall, her eyes now blazing with impossible hope and the tears
on her cheek half-dried, leapt to her feet and cried, "<em>With me,
Mr. Potter!</em> " and, without waiting for a reply, tore down the
stairs that led to the bottom platform where waited a chair of dark
metal.</p>
<p>It took a moment, but Harry ran after; though it took him longer
to reach the bottom, after Professor McGonagall vaulted half the
stairs with a strange catlike motion and landed with the
astonished-looking Auror trio already pointing their wands at
her.</p>
<p>"Miss Granger!" cried Professor McGonagall. "Can you speak
yet?"</p>
<p>Much as with Professor McGonagall, there was a certain sense in
which it could be said that Harry had forgotten about the existence
of Hermione Granger, because Harry had been tilting his neck back
to look upward rather than downward, and because he hadn't
considered her a solution to any of his current problems. Though it
was hardly certain, in fact it wasn't at all probable, that Harry
remembering to look at Hermione or think about what she must be
feeling, would have helped anything in the slightest.</p>
<p>Harry reached the bottom of the stairs and saw Hermione Granger
full on -</p>
<p>Without thinking, without being able to help himself, Harry shut
his eyes, but he'd seen.</p>
<p>Her school robes around her neck, soaked all the way through
with tears.</p>
<p>The way she'd been looking away from <em>him</em>.</p>
<p>And the eye of memory and sympathy, which could not be shut,
which could not look away, knew that Hermione had recounted the
worst shame of her life in front of the nobility of magical Britain
and Professor McGonagall and Dumbledore and Harry; and then been
sentenced to Azkaban where she would be exposed to darkness and
cold and all her worst memories until she went mad and died; and
then she'd heard that Harry was going to give away all his money
and go into debt to save her, and maybe even sacrifice his life</p>
<p>and with the Dementor standing only a few paces behind her</p>
<p>she hadn't said anything...</p>
<p>"Y-yes," whispered the voice of Hermione Granger. "I c-can
talk."</p>
<p>Harry opened his eyes again and saw her face, now looking at
him. It didn't say anything like what he thought Hermione was
feeling, faces couldn't say anything that complicated, all facial
muscles could do was contort themselves into knots.</p>
<p>"H-H-Harry, I-I'm so, I'm so -"</p>
<p>"Shut up," Harry suggested.</p>
<p>"s-s-sorry -"</p>
<p>"If you'd never met me on the train you wouldn't be in any
trouble right now. So shut up," said Harry Potter.</p>
<p>"Both of you stop being silly," Professor McGonagall said in her
firm Scottish accent (it was strange how much that helped). "Mr.
Potter, hold out your wand so that Miss Granger's fingers can touch
it. Miss Granger, repeat after me. Upon my life and magic -"</p>
<p>Harry did as he was bid, thrusting his wand forward to touch
Hermione's fingers; and then Hermione's faltering voice said, "Upon
my life and magic -"</p>
<p>"I swear service to the House of Potter -" said Professor
McGonagall.</p>
<p>And Hermione, without waiting for any further instructions,
said, the words spilling out of her in a rush, "I swear service to
the House of Potter, to obey its Master or Mistress, and stand at
their right hand, and fight at their command, and follow where they
go, until the day I die."</p>
<p>All those words had been blurted out in a desperate gasp before
Harry could have thought or said anything, if he'd been mad enough
to interrupt.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter, repeat these words," said Professor McGonagall. "I,
Harry, heir and last scion of the Potters, accept your service,
until the end of the world and its magic."</p>
<p>Harry took a breath and said, "I, Harry, heir and last scion of
the Potters, accept your service, until the end of the world and
its magic."</p>
<p>"That's it," said Professor McGonagall. "Well done."</p>
<p>Harry looked up, and saw that the entire Wizengamot, whose
existence he'd forgotten, was staring at them.</p>
<p>And then Minerva McGonagall, who <em>was</em> Head of House
Gryffindor even if she didn't always act like it, looked up high
above at where Lucius Malfoy stood; and she said to him before the
entire Wizengamot, "I regret every point I ever gave you in
Transfiguration, you vile little worm."</p>
<p>Whatever Lucius was about to say in reply was silenced by a tap
of the short rod in Dumbledore's hand. "Ahem!" said the old wizard
from his podium of dark stone. "This session has carried on quite
considerably, and if it is not dismissed soon, some of us may miss
their entire luncheon. The law of this matter is clear. You have
already voted on the terms of the bargain, and Lord Malfoy cannot
legally decline it. As we have far exceeded our allotted time, I
now, in accordance with the last decision of the survivors of the
eighty-eighth Wizengamot, adjourn this session."</p>
<p>The old wizard tapped the rod of dark stone three times.</p>
<p>"You fools!" shouted Lucius Malfoy. The white hair was shaking
as though in a wind, the face beneath was pale with fury. "Do you
think you'll get away with what you've done today? Do you think
that girl can try to murder my son and escape unscathed?"</p>
<p>The toad-like pink-makeup woman, whose name Harry could no
longer remember, was standing up from her seat. "Why, of course
not," she said with a sickening smile. "After all, the girl
<em>is</em> still a murderess, and I think the Ministry shall be
watching her affairs quite closely - it hardly seems wise that she
should be allowed to wander the streets, after all -"</p>
<p>Harry was fed up at this point.</p>
<p>Without waiting to listen, Harry turned on his heel and strode
forward in long steps toward -</p>
<p>The horror only he could truly see, the absence of color and
space, the wound in the world, above which floated a tattered
cloak; most imperfectly guarded by a running moonlit squirrel and
fluttering silver sparrow.</p>
<p>His dark side had also noticed, when it was looking through the
entire room for anything that could possibly be used as a weapon,
that the enemy had been foolish enough to bring a Dementor into
Harry's presence. That was a powerful weapon indeed, and one that
Harry might wield better than its supposed masters. There had been
a time in Azkaban when Harry had told twelve Dementors to turn and
go, and they had gone.</p>
<p><em>The Dementors are Death, and the Patronus Charm works by
thinking about happy thoughts instead of Death.</em></p>
<p>If Harry's theory was correct, that one sentence would be all it
took to pop the Aurors' Patronus Charms like a soap bubble, and
ensure that nobody within reach of his voice could cast another
one.</p>
<p><em>I am going to cancel the Patronus Charms and prevent any
more Patronuses from being cast. And then my Dementor, flying
faster than any broomstick, is going to Kiss everyone here who
voted to send a twelve-year-old girl to Azkaban.</em></p>
<p>Say that, to set up the if-then expectation, and wait for people
to understand and laugh. Then speak the fatal truth; and when the
Aurors' Patronuses winked out to prove the point, either people's
<em>anticipations</em> of the mindless void, or Harry's threat of
its destruction, would make the Dementor obey. Those who had sought
to compromise with the darkness would be consumed by it.</p>
<p>It was the other solution his dark side had devised.</p>
<p>Ignoring the gasps rising from behind him, Harry crossed the
radius of the Patronuses, strode to a single pace from Death. Its
unhindered fear burst around him like a whirlpool, like stepping
next to the sucking drain of some huge bathtub emptying out its
water; but with the false Patronuses no longer obscuring the level
on which they interacted, Harry could reach the Dementor even as it
could reach him. Harry looked straight into the pulling vacuum and
-</p>
<p><em>the Earth among the stars</em></p>
<p>all his triumph at saving Hermione</p>
<p><em>someday the reality of which you are a shadow will cease to
exist</em></p>
<p>Harry took all the silver emotion that fueled his Patronus Charm
and <em>shoved</em> it at the Dementor; and expected Death's shadow
to flee from him -</p>
<p>- and as Harry did that, he flung his hands up and shouted
"BOO!"</p>
<p>The void retreated sharply away from Harry until it came up
against the dark stone behind.</p>
<p>In the hall there was a deathly silence.</p>
<p>Harry turned his back on the empty void, and looked up at where
the toad-woman stood. She was pale beneath the pink makeup, her
mouth opening and closing like a fish.</p>
<p>"I make you this one offer," said the Boy-Who-Lived. "I never
learn that you've been interfering with me or any of mine. And you
never find out why the unkillable soul-eating monster is scared of
me. Now sit down and shut up."</p>
<p>The toad-woman fell back down to her bench without a word.</p>
<p>Harry looked further up.</p>
<p>"A riddle, Lord Malfoy!" the Boy-Who-Lived shouted across the
Most Ancient Hall. "I know you weren't in Ravenclaw, but try to
answer this one anyway! What destroys Dark Lords, frightens
Dementors, and owes you sixty thousand Galleons?"</p>
<p>For an instant Lord Malfoy stood there with eyes slightly
widened; then his face fell back into calm scorn, and his voice
spoke coolly in reply. "Are you openly threatening me, Mr.
Potter?"</p>
<p>"I'm not threatening you," said the Boy-Who-Lived. "I'm
<em>scaring</em> you. There's a difference."</p>
<p>"Enough, Mr. Potter," said Professor McGonagall. "We shall be
late for afternoon Transfiguration as it is. And do come back here,
you're still terrifying that poor Dementor." She turned to the
Aurors. "Mr. Kleiner, if you would!"</p>
<p>Harry strode back to them, as the Auror addressed moved forward
and pressed a short rod of dark metal to the dark metal chair,
muttering an inaudible word of dismissal.</p>
<p>The chains slithered back as smoothly as they had come forth;
and Hermione pushed herself out of the chair as fast as she could,
and half-ran and half-staggered forward a few steps.</p>
<p>Harry held out his arms -</p>
<p>- and Hermione half-jumped half-fell into Professor McGonagall's
arms, beginning to sob hysterically.</p>
<p><em>Hmpfh,</em> said a voice inside Harry. <em>I kind of thought
we'd earned that one ourselves.</em></p>
<p><em>Oh, shut up.</em></p>
<p>Professor McGonagall was holding Hermione so firmly that you
might have thought it was a mother holding her daughter, or maybe
granddaughter. After a few moments Hermione's sobs slowed, and then
stopped. Professor McGonagall suddenly shifted her stance and
grabbed onto her more tightly; the girl's hands were dangling
limply, now, and her eyes were closed -</p>
<p>"She'll be fine, Mr. Potter," Professor McGonagall said softly
in Harry's direction, without looking at him. "She just needs a few
hours in one of Madam Pomfrey's beds."</p>
<p>"All right, then," Harry said. "Let's get her to Madam
Pomfrey's."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Dumbledore, as he descended to the bottom of the
dark stone stairs. "Let us all go home, indeed." His blue eyes were
locked on Harry, as hard as sapphires.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The Lords and Ladies of the Wizengamot are departing their
wooden benches, leaving as they came, looking rather nervous.</p>
<p>The vast majority are thinking 'The Dementor was frightened of
the Boy-Who-Lived!'</p>
<p>Some of the shrewder ones are already wondering how this will
affect the delicate power balance of the Wizengamot - if a new
piece has appeared upon the gameboard.</p>
<p>Almost none are thinking anything along the lines of 'I wonder
how he did that.'</p>
<p>This is the truth of the Wizengamot: Many are nobles, many are
wealthy magnates of business, a few came by their status in other
ways. Some of them are stupid. Most are shrewd in the realms of
business and politics, but their shrewdness is circumscribed.
Almost none have walked the path of a powerful wizard. They have
not read through ancient books, scrutinized old scrolls, searching
for truths too powerful to walk openly and disguised in conundrums,
hunting for true magic among a hundred fantastic fairy tales. When
they are not looking at a contract of debt, they abandon what
shrewdness they possess and relax with some comfortable nonsense.
They believe in the Deathly Hallows, but they also believe that
Merlin fought the dread Totoro and imprisoned the Ree. They know
(because that too is part of the standard legend) that a powerful
wizard must learn to distinguish the truth among a hundred
plausible lies. But it has not occurred to them that they might do
the same.</p>
<p>(Why not? Why, indeed, would wizards with enough status and
wealth to turn their hands to almost any endeavor, choose to spend
their lives fighting over lucrative monopolies on ink importation?
The Headmaster of Hogwarts would hardly see the question; of course
most people should not be powerful wizards, just as most people
should not be heroes. The Defense Professor could explain at great
and cynical length why their ambitions are so trivial; to him, too,
there is no puzzle. Only Harry Potter, for all the books he has
read, is unable to understand; to the Boy-Who-Lived the life
choices of the Lords and Ladies seem incomprehensible - not what a
good person would do, nor yet an evil person either. Now which of
the three is most wise?)</p>
<p>For whatever reason, then, most of the Wizengamot has never
walked the path that leads to powerful wizardry; they do not seek
out what is hidden. For them, there is no <em>why.</em> There is no
explanation. There is no causality. The Boy-Who-Lived, who was
already halfway into the magisterium of legend, has now been
promoted all the way there; and it is a brute fact, simple and
unexplained, that the Boy-Who-Lived frightens Dementors. Ten years
earlier they were told that a one-year-old boy defeated the most
terrible Dark Lord of their generation, perhaps the most evil Dark
Lord ever to live; and they just accepted that too.</p>
<p>You are not meant to question that sort of thing (they know in
some unspoken way). If the most terrible Dark Lord in history,
confronts an innocent baby - why, how could he <em>not</em> be
vanquished? The rhythm of the play demands it. You are supposed to
applaud, not stand up from your seat in the audience and say 'Why?'
It is just the story's conceit, that in the end the Dark Lord is
brought down by a little child; and if you are going to question
that, you might as well not attend the play in the first place.</p>
<p>It does not occur to them to second-guess the application of
such reasoning to the events they have seen with their own eyes in
the Most Ancient Hall. Indeed, they are not consciously aware that
they are using story-reasoning on real life. As for scrutinizing
the Boy-Who-Lived with the same careful logic they would use on a
political alliance or a business arrangement - what brain would
associate to <em>that,</em> when a part of the legendary
magisterium is at hand?</p>
<p>But there are a very few, seated on those wooden benches, who do
<em>not</em> think like this.</p>
<p>There are a certain few of the Wizengamot who have read through
half-disintegrated scrolls and listened to tales of things that
happened to someone's brother's cousin, not for entertainment, but
as part of a quest for power and truth. They have already marked
the Night of Godric's Hollow, as reported by Albus Dumbledore, as
an anomalous and potentially important event. They have wondered
why it happened, if it did happen; or if not, why Dumbledore is
lying.</p>
<p>And when an eleven-year-old boy rises up and says "Lucius
Malfoy" in that cold adult voice, and goes on to speak words one
simply would not expect to hear from a first-year in Hogwarts, they
do not allow the fact to slip into the lawless blurs of legends and
the premises of plays.</p>
<p>They mark it as a clue.</p>
<p>They add it to the list.</p>
<p>This list is beginning to look somewhat alarming.</p>
<p>It doesn't particularly help when the boy yells "BOO!" at a
Dementor and the decaying corpse presses itself flat against the
opposite wall and its horrible ear-hurting voice rasps, "<em>Make
him go away.</em>"</p>

<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 82: Taboo Tradeoffs,
Final<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>Phoenix travel was a sensation entirely unlike Apparition or
portkeys. You caught on fire - you definitely felt yourself
catching on fire, even though there was no pain - and instead of
burning to ashes, the fire burned all the way through you and you
<em>became</em> fire, and then you went out in one place and blazed
up in another. It didn't sicken the stomach like portkeys or
Apparition, but it was a rather unnerving experience nonetheless.
If the underlying truth of phoenix travel really was becoming a
specific instantiation of a more general Fire, then that seemed to
hint you could potentially burn <em>anywhere -</em> even in the
distant past, or in another universe, or in two places at once. You
might go out in one place and blaze up in a hundred others, and the
you who arrived at Hogwarts would never know the difference. Though
Harry had read what he could about phoenixes, trying to figure out
how to get one of his own, and there'd been no hint of anything
remotely like <em>that</em> capability.</p>
<p>Harry caught fire and went out and blazed up somewhere else; and
just like that he, and the Headmaster, and the unconscious form of
Hermione Granger held in the Headmaster's arms, were occupying
another place; with Fawkes above them all. A calm, warm room of
bright stone columns, skylit on all four sides, populated by white
beds in long rows, four of which had silencing veils drawn around
them, and the rest empty.</p>
<p>In one corner of Harry's vision, a surprised-looking Madam
Pomfrey was turning toward them. Dumbledore seemed to pay the
senior healer no heed, as he carefully laid down Hermione on an
unoccupied white bed.</p>
<p>From a distant corner there was a flash of green, and from out
of a fireplace strode Professor McGonagall, brushing herself off
slightly from the Floo ashes.</p>
<p>The old wizard turned from the bed and reached one of his arms
around Harry again; and then the Boy-Who-Lived and his wizard
vanished in another burst of fire.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>When Harry had fully lit up again he was standing in the
Headmaster's office, amid the noises of a dozen dozen inexplicable
gidgets.</p>
<p>The young boy took a step away from the old wizard and then
turned on him, emerald and sapphire eyes meeting.</p>
<p>The two of them did not speak for a time, looking at each other;
as though all they had to speak could be said only by stares, and
not said in any other way.</p>
<p>In time the boy enunciated words slowly and precisely.</p>
<p>"I cannot believe that a phoenix is still upon your
shoulder."</p>
<p>"The phoenix chooses but once," said the old wizard. "They might
perhaps leave a master who chooses evil over good; they will not
leave a master forced to choose between one good and another.
Phoenixes are not arrogant. They know the limits of their own
wisdom." Stern indeed, that ancient gaze. "Unlike you, Harry."</p>
<p>"Choose between one good and another," Harry echoed flatly.
"Like Hermione Granger's life, versus a hundred thousand Galleons."
The rage and indignation Harry wanted to put into his voice wasn't
quite there, for some reason, maybe because -</p>
<p>"You are hardly in a position to speak to me of that, Harry
Potter." The Headmaster's voice was deceptively soft. "Or what was
that look of reluctance that I saw upon your face, there in the
Most Ancient Hall?"</p>
<p>The sense of inward hollowness grew worse. "I was looking for
other alternatives," Harry bit out. "Some way to save her that
<em>didn't</em> lose the money."</p>
<p><em>Wow,</em> said Ravenclaw. <em>You just told an outright lie.
Not only that, I think you actually</em> believed <em>it for the
seconds it took to say it. That's kinda scary.</em></p>
<p>"<em>Is</em> that what you were thinking, Harry?" The blue eyes
were keen, and there was a terrifying moment when Harry wondered if
the world's most powerful wizard could see right past his
Occlumency barriers.</p>
<p>"<em>Yes,</em>" Harry said, "I flinched away from the pain of
losing all the money in my vault. But I <em>did</em> it!
<em>That's</em> what counts! And <em>you</em> -" The indignation
that had faltered out of Harry's voice returned. "You
<em>actually</em> put a price on Hermione Granger's life, and you
put it below a hundred thousand Galleons!"</p>
<p>"Oh?" the old wizard said softly. "And what price do you put on
her life, then? A million Galleons?"</p>
<p>"Are you familiar with the economic concept of 'replacement
value'?" The words were spilling from Harry's lips almost faster
than he could consider them. "Hermione's replacement value is
<em>infinite!</em> There's nowhere I can go to buy another
one!"</p>
<p><em>Now you're just talking mathematical nonsense,</em> said
Slytherin. <em>Ravenclaw, back me up here?</em></p>
<p>"Is Minerva's life also of infinite worth?" the old wizard said
harshly. "Would you sacrifice Minerva to save Hermione?"</p>
<p>"Yes and yes," Harry snapped. "That's part of Professor
McGonagall's job and she knows it."</p>
<p>"Then Minerva's value is not infinite," said the old wizard,
"for all that she is loved. There can only be one king upon a
chessboard, Harry Potter, only one piece that you will sacrifice
any other piece to save. And Hermione Granger is not that piece.
Make no mistake, Harry Potter, this day you may well have lost your
war."</p>
<p>And if the old wizard's words hadn't hit quite so hard, and
quite so close to home, Harry might not have said what he said
then.</p>
<p>"Lucius was right," Harry ground out. "You never had a wife, you
never had a daughter, you've never had anything but war -"</p>
<p>The old wizard's left hand closed hard upon Harry's wrist, bony
fingers digging into the still-developing muscle of Harry's arm,
and for a moment Harry was paralyzed with the shock of it, he had
forgotten what it meant that adults were stronger.</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore did not seem to notice. He only turned,
dragging Harry with him, and moved forward in hard steps toward the
wall of the room.</p>
<p>"<em>Phoenix's price.</em>"</p>
<p>Harry was pulled up along the black stairs.</p>
<p>"<em>Phoenix's fate.</em>"</p>
<p>The room of black pedestals, silver light falling on shattered
wands.</p>
<p>"You think," yelled Harry, after his lips unlocked, "that you
can win any argument, just by standing here?"</p>
<p>The old wizard ignored him, dragging Harry across the room. His
right hand, no longer holding his wand, grabbed up a vial of silver
fluid -</p>
<p>Harry blinked in shock; the vial of silver fluid had been
standing next to a picture of <em>Dumbledore,</em> or so it had
appeared to Harry in the brief moment before he was dragged
past.</p>
<p>Past the end of all the pedestals, at the farthest part of the
room, rose a great stone basin with runes carved into it that Harry
didn't recognize. The center was a shallow depression filled with
transparent liquid, and into this the old wizard dumped the
canister of silver fluid, which at once began to spread out, to
swirl, to set the entire basin glowing eerie white.</p>
<p>The old wizard's hand let go of Harry's arm and gestured to the
glowing basin, commanding harshly, "Look!"</p>
<p>As requested, Harry stared at the glowing water.</p>
<p>"Put your head into the Pensieve, Harry Potter." The old
wizard's voice was stern.</p>
<p>Harry had heard that word before, but he couldn't remember where
. "What - does this do -"</p>
<p>"Memories," the old wizard said. "You will see my memory. My
oath that it is safe. Now look into the Pensieve, Ravenclaw, if you
still care anything at all for your precious truth!"</p>
<p>That was a request that Harry could not deny, and he stepped
forward and thrust his head into the glowing water.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Harry was sitting behind the desk in the Headmaster's office
of Hogwarts, and his wrinkled hands that clutched at his head were
spotted with age and white hairs.</em></p>
<p><em>"He is all that I have!" wept a voice, very strange was
Dumbledore's voice as Dumbledore himself remembered it, from the
inside it seemed far less stern and wise. "The last of my family!
All that I have left!"</em></p>
<p><em>No emotion had been allowed to pass through the Pensieve,
only the physical sensation of seeming to speak the words. Harry
heard the utter desolation in Dumbledore's words, the sounds that
seemed to come from Harry's own throat, but Harry did not feel it
beyond the hearing.</em></p>
<p><em>"You've got no choice," said a harsh voice.</em></p>
<p><em>The eyes moved, the field of vision jumped to a man that
Harry didn't recognize, in clothing tinged with Auror crimson but
made of solid leather with many pockets.</em></p>
<p><em>His right eye was overlarge, with an electric-blue pupil
that constantly darted and moved.</em></p>
<p><em>"You cannot ask this of me, Alastor!" Dumbledore's voice was
wild. "Not this! Anything but this!"</em></p>
<p><em>"I'm not asking," growled the man. "Voldie's the one who's
asking, and you're going to tell him no."</em></p>
<p><em>"For money, Alastor?" Dumbledore's voice was begging. "Only
for money?"</em></p>
<p><em>"You ransom Aberforth, you lose the war," the man said
sharply. "That simple. One hundred thousand Galleons is nearly all
we've got in the war-chest, and if you use it like this, it won't
be refilled. What'll you do, try to convince the Potters to empty
their vault like the Longbottoms already did? Voldie's just going
to kidnap someone else and make another demand. Alice, Minerva,
anyone you care about, they'll all be targets if you pay off the
Death Eaters. That's not the lesson you should be trying to teach
them."</em></p>
<p><em>"If I do this I will have no one. No one." Dumbledore's
voice broke, the world tilted as the outlooking head fell down into
the ancient hands, and awful sounds came from not-Harry's throat as
he began to sob like a child.</em></p>
<p><em>"Shall I tell Voldie's messenger no?" said Alastor's voice,
now strangely gentle. "You don't have to do it yourself, old
friend."</em></p>
<p><em>"No - I will say it myself - I must -"</em></p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The memory ended with a shock and Harry ripped his head out of
the glowing water, gasping as though he'd been deprived of air.</p>
<p>The transition between scenes, between decade-old reality and
present moment, was another jolt to Harry's mind; in some fashion
his immersion in the past had unanchored him. The broken old man
sobbing in his office had been another person in another era, Harry
had understood that much; someone softer -</p>
<p>Before it had all vanished like dissipating smoke, returning the
<em>now,</em> the present day.</p>
<p>Terrible and stern stood the ancient wizard, like he was carven
from stone; beard woven of thread like iron, half-moon glasses like
mirrors, and the pupils behind as sharp and unyielding as black
diamond.</p>
<p>"Do you also wish to see my brother as he died under the
Cruciatus?" said Albus Dumbledore. "Voldemort sent me that memory
as well!"</p>
<p>"And that - " Harry was having trouble producing a voice, for
the growing sickness in his chest. "<em>That</em> was when -" The
words seemed to burn in his throat, as the awful knowledge dawned
on him, the horrible understanding. "That was when you burned
Narcissa Malfoy alive in her own bedroom."</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore's gaze was cold as he answered. "To that
question only a fool would say yea or nay. What matters is that the
Death Eaters believe I killed her, and that belief kept safe the
families of all who served the Order of the Phoenix - until this
day. Now do you understand what you have done? What you have done
to your <em>friends,</em> Harry Potter, and to any that stand with
you?" The old wizard seemed to grow still taller and more terrible,
as his voice rose louder. "You have made them all targets, and
targets they will remain! Until you prove, the only way it can be
proven, that you are no longer willing to pay such prices!"</p>
<p>"And is it true?" Harry said. There was a buzzing sensation
filling him, his body growing more distant. "What Draco said, that
Narcissa Malfoy never got her hands dirty, that she was only
Lucius's wife? She was an enabler, I get that, but I can't back
that deserving being <em>burned alive</em>."</p>
<p>"Nothing less would have convinced them that I was done with
hesitation." The old wizard's voice brooked no question and no
refusal. "Always I was too reluctant to do as I must, always it was
others who paid the cost of my mercy. So Alastor told me from the
beginning, but I did not listen to him. You, I expect, shall prove
better at such decisions than I."</p>
<p>"I'm surprised," Harry said, amazed that his voice was almost
steady. "I would have expected the Death Eaters to go after another
Light family and start a cycle of escalating retaliation, if you
didn't get them all with your first strike."</p>
<p>"If my opponent had been Lucius, perhaps." Dumbledore's eyes
were like stones. "I am told that Voldemort laughed at the news,
and proclaimed to his Death Eaters that I had finally grown, and
was at last a worthy opponent. Perhaps he was right. After the day
I condemned my brother to his death, I began to weigh those who
followed me, balancing them one against another, asking who I would
risk, and who I would sacrifice, to what end. It was strange how
many fewer pieces I lost, once I knew what they were worth."</p>
<p>Harry's jaw seemed locked, like it took a massive effort to make
his lips move. "But then it's not like Lucius was deliberately
taking Hermione for ransom," Harry's voice said thinly. "From
Lucius's perspective, someone else broke the truce first. So with
that in mind, how many Galleons <em>was</em> Hermione worth,
exactly? Leaving aside the Danegeld thing, if it was just some
ordinary threat to her life, how much should I have paid to save
her? Ten thousand Galleons? Five thousand?"</p>
<p>The old wizard did not answer.</p>
<p>"It's a funny thing," Harry said, his voice wavering like
something seen through water. "Do you know, the day I went in front
of the Dementor, what my worst memory was? It was my parents dying.
I heard their voices and everything."</p>
<p>The old wizard's eyes widened behind the half-moon glasses.</p>
<p>"And here's the thing," Harry said, "here's the thing I've been
thinking about over and over. The Dark Lord gave Lily Potter the
chance to walk away. He said that she could flee. He <em>told</em>
her that dying in front of the crib wouldn't save her baby. 'Step
aside, foolish woman, if you have any sense in you at all -'" An
awful chill came over Harry as he spoke those words from his own
lips, but he shook it off and continued. "And afterward I kept
thinking, I couldn't seem to stop myself from thinking, wasn't the
Dark Lord <em>right?</em> If only Mother had stepped away. She
tried to curse the Dark Lord but it was suicide, she had to have
<em>known</em> that it was suicide. Her choice wasn't between her
life and mine, her choice was for herself to live or for both of us
to die! If she'd only done the logical thing and walked away, I
mean, I love Mum too, but Lily Potter would be alive right now and
she would be my mother!" Tears were blurring Harry's eyes. "Only
now I understand, I know what Mother must have felt. She
<em>couldn't</em> step aside from the crib. She couldn't! Love
doesn't walk away!"</p>
<p>It was like the old wizard had been struck, struck by a chisel
that shattered him straight down the middle.</p>
<p>"What have I said?" the old wizard whispered. "What have I said
to you?"</p>
<p>"I don't know!" shouted Harry. "I wasn't listening either!"</p>
<p>"I - I'm sorry, Harry - I -" The old wizard pressed his hands to
his face, and Harry saw that Albus Dumbledore was weeping. "I
should not have said, such things to you - I should not, have
resented, your innocence -"</p>
<p>Harry stared at the wizard for another second, and then Harry
turned and marched out of the black room, down the stairs, through
the office -</p>
<p>"I really don't know why you're still on his shoulder," Harry
said to Fawkes.</p>
<p>- out the oaken door and into the endlessly turning spiral.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry had arrived in the Transfiguration classroom before anyone
else, before even Professor McGonagall. There was Charms class
earlier, for his year, but that he hadn't even bothered trying to
attend. Whether Professor McGonagall would make today's class he
didn't know. There was something ominous about all the empty desks
beside him, the absence at the board. As if he stood alone in
Hogwarts, with all his friends departed.</p>
<p>According to the class schedule, today's lesson was on sustained
Transfigurations, all the rules of which Harry had learned by heart
back when he was Transfiguring a huge rock into the small diamond
that shone on his pinky finger. It would be a theoretical subject,
rather than practical, for the rest of the class; which was a pity,
because he could have used a dose of Transfiguration's trance.</p>
<p>Harry noted distantly that his hand was trembling, to the point
where he had trouble undoing the pouch's drawstring as he drew
forth the Transfiguration textbook.</p>
<p><em>You were monstrously unfair to Dumbledore,</em> said the
voice Harry had been calling Slytherin, only now it also seemed to
be the Voice of Economic Sensibility and maybe also Conscience.</p>
<p>Harry's eyes dropped down to his textbook, but the section was
so familiar it might as well have been a blank parchment.</p>
<p><em>Dumbledore fought a war against a Dark Lord who deliberately
set out to break him in the cruelest possible way. He had to choose
between losing his war and his brother. Albus Dumbledore knows, he
learned in the worst possible way, that there are limits to the
value of one life; and it almost broke his sanity to admit it. But
you, Harry Potter -</em> you <em>already knew better.</em></p>
<p>"Shut up," the boy whispered to the empty Transfiguration
classroom, though there was nobody there to hear it.</p>
<p><em>You'd already read about Philip Tetlock's experiments on
people asked to trade off a sacred value against a secular one,
like a hospital administrator who has to choose between spending a
million dollars on a liver to save a five-year-old, and spending
the million dollars to buy other hospital equipment or pay
physician salaries. And the subjects in the experiment became
indignant and wanted to punish the hospital administrator for even
thinking about the choice. Do you remember reading about that,
Harry Potter? Do you remember thinking how very stupid that was,
since if hospital equipment and doctor salaries didn't also save
lives, there would be no point in having hospitals or doctors?
Should the hospital administrator have paid a billion pounds for
that liver, even if it meant the hospital going bankrupt the next
day?</em></p>
<p>"Shut up!" the boy whispered.</p>
<p><em>Every time you spend money in order to save a life with some
probability, you establish a lower bound on the monetary value of a
life. Every time you refuse to spend money to save a life with some
probability, you establish an upper bound on the monetary value of
life. If your upper bounds and lower bounds are inconsistent, it
means you could move money from one place to another, and save more
lives at the same cost. So if you want to use a bounded amount of
money to save as many lives as possible, your choices must be
consistent with</em> some <em>monetary value assigned to a human
life; if not then you could reshuffle the same money and do better.
How very sad, how very hollow the indignation, of those who refuse
to say that money and life can ever be compared, when all they're
doing is forbidding the strategy that saves the most people, for
the sake of pretentious moral grandstanding...</em></p>
<p><em>You</em> knew <em>that, and you still said what you did to
Dumbledore.</em></p>
<p><em>You deliberately</em> tried <em>to hurt Dumbledore's
feelings.</em></p>
<p>He's <em>never tried to hurt</em> you, <em>Harry Potter, not
once.</em></p>
<p>Harry's head dropped into his hands.</p>
<p>Why had Harry said what he'd said, to a sad old ancient wizard
who'd fought hard and endured more than anyone should ever have to
endure? Even if the old wizard was wrong, did he deserve to be hurt
for it, after all that had happened to him? Why was there a part of
him that seemed to get angry at the old wizard beyond reason,
lashing out at him harder than Harry had ever hit anyone, without
thought of moderation once the rage had been raised, only to quiet
as soon as Harry left his presence?</p>
<p><em>Is it because you know Dumbledore won't fight back? That no
matter what you say to him, however unfair, he'll never use his own
power against you, he'll never treat you the way you treat him? Is
this the way you treat people when you know they won't hit back?
James Potter's bullying genes, manifesting at last?</em></p>
<p>Harry closed his eyes.</p>
<p>Like the Sorting Hat speaking inside his head -</p>
<p><em>What is the real reason for your anger?</em></p>
<p><em>What do you fear?</em></p>
<p>A whirlwind of images seemed to flash through Harry's mind,
then, the past Dumbledore weeping into his hands; the present form
of the old wizard, standing tall and terrible; a vision of Hermione
screaming in her chains, in the metal chair, as Harry abandoned her
to the Dementors; and an imagination of a woman with long white
hair (had she looked like her husband?) falling amid the flames of
her bedroom, as a wand was held upon her and orange light reflected
from half-moon glasses.</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore had seemed to think that Harry would be better
at that sort of thing than him.</p>
<p>And Harry knew that he probably would be. He knew the math,
after all.</p>
<p>But it was understood, somehow it was understood, that
utilitarian ethicists didn't <em>actually</em> rob banks so they
could give the money to the poor. The end result of throwing away
all ethical constraint wouldn't <em>actually</em> be sunshine and
roses and happiness for all. The prescription of consequentialism
was to take the action that led to the best net consequences, not
actions that had one positive consequence and wrecked everything
else along the way. Expected utility maximizers were allowed to
take common sense into account, when they were calculating their
expectations.</p>
<p>Somehow Harry had understood that, even before anyone else had
warned him he'd understood. Before he'd read about Vladimir Lenin
or the history of the French Revolution, he'd known. It might have
been his earliest science fiction books warning him about people
with good intentions, or maybe Harry had just seen the logic for
himself. Somehow he'd known from the very beginning, that if he
stepped outside his ethics <em>whenever there was a reason,</em>
the end result wouldn't be good.</p>
<p>A final image came to him, then: Lily Potter standing in front
of her baby's crib and measuring the intervals between outcomes:
the final outcome if she stayed and tried to curse her enemy (dead
Lily, dead Harry), the final outcome if she walked away (live Lily,
dead Harry), weighing the expected utilities, and making the only
sensible choice.</p>
<p>She would've been Harry's mother if she had.</p>
<p>"But human beings can't live like that," the boy's lips
whispered to the empty classroom. "Human beings can't live like
that."</p>

<p>When Padma entered the Transfiguration classroom, she saw that
half the class had beaten her there, a strange, deathly silence
pervading the room. Harry Potter sat alone in one corner, staring
off into some unknown distance, his eyes half-lidded, nearly
closed.</p>
<p>Rumor said that the Aurors had discovered that the Defense
Professor had Polyjuiced as Granger to fool Malfoy.</p>
<p>Rumor said that Hermione had been bound by the Unbreakable Vow
to be Draco Malfoy's slave.</p>
<p>Rumor said that Hermione had gotten the Dementor's Kiss.</p>
<p>But if <em>that</em> were true, Harry Potter wouldn't be sitting
there, he would be -</p>
<p>Padma didn't know what General Potter would do. Her mind went
blank, trying to think about it.</p>
<p>Even when Professor McGonagall got there, the silence hadn't
broken. The Transfiguration Professor walked up to the board
without a pause, erased it with a sweep of her hand, and then began
to write.</p>
<p>"Today, children," began the calm professional voice of the
Transfiguration Professor, just as though nothing out of the
ordinary had happened that week, "we shall learn how much effort it
takes to sustain a Transfiguration, and why, at your age, you
should not even try. The original Form is not gone, only
suppressed; and to maintain that suppression -"</p>
<p>"Excuse me," said Padma Patil. She knew her voice was shaking,
she knew that she was trembling visibly, but she had to ask.
"Excuse me, Professor, what happened with Miss Granger?"</p>
<p>The Transfiguration Professor paused at the board, and turned to
look at Padma. The Professor should have looked stern, having been
interrupted without a hand being raised, but instead her face was
kindly. "You don't already know, Miss Patil? I expected that rumor
would have spread."</p>
<p>"There's too many rumors," said Padma. "I don't know what's
true."</p>
<p>Morag MacDougal raised her hand, then said without waiting to be
called, "I told you, Padma, what's <em>true</em> is that the
Wizengamot found Granger guilty and ordered her to get the
Dementor's Kiss and they brought in the Dementor and Harry Potter
glued it to the ceiling and wouldn't let it down until -"</p>
<p>"Oh, dear Merlin," said Professor McGonagall, her expression
growing sharp, but then she visibly calmed herself. "The affair was
utterly ridiculous and I shan't go into detail. Let it stand that
Miss Granger is resting with Madam Pomfrey for now, and coming back
to classes tomorrow. And if I catch anyone bothering her, I shall
turn them into glass vases and drop them."</p>
<p>The entire class gasped at this; it wasn't so much that the
threat was fatal, as that it broke the safety rules for
Transfiguration.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall turned back to her board -</p>
<p>From a corner of the classroom, another voice rose up. "What
about Professor Quirrell?" said Terry Boot. "Has he been
arrested?"</p>
<p>"The Aurors are only detaining him," said the Transfiguration
Professor without turning around. "If they have not given back our
Defense Professor by tomorrow, I shall ask the Headmaster to go
fetch him. Though I may as well tell you now that the Board of
Governors has scheduled a vote on whether Professor Quirrell's
battles shall be allowed to continue."</p>
<p>Kevin Entwhistle spoke. "And General Malfoy? When's he getting
back from St. Mungo's?"</p>
<p>The Transfiguration Professor paused in her drawing.</p>
<p>She turned around again, more slowly, this time.</p>
<p>"I <em>am</em> sorry, Mr. Entwhistle," said Professor
McGonagall. Her face looked a little more lined than when she had
entered the room. "Mr. Malfoy's health is in no danger, I am given
to understand. Unfortunately, I have received an owl from Mr.
Malfoy's father withdrawing him from Hogwarts. I am afraid he is
not coming back."</p>

<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 80: Taboo Tradeoffs, Pt 2, The
Horns Effect<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>The Most Ancient Hall of the Wizengamot is cool and dark, with
concentric half-circles of stone rising up from the lowest center,
and simple wooden benches set down upon those elevated
half-circles. There is no source of light, but the chamber is
well-lit, without any apparent cause or reason; it is simply a
brute fact that the hall is well-lit. The walls like the floor are
stone, dark stone, some elegant and mysterious conjugation of rock
most fine to gaze upon, with a smooth texture that seems to flow
and shift beneath its surface. This is the Most Ancient Hall, the
oldest place of wizardry that has lasted into the modern day; every
other place of power was destroyed in one war or another. This is
the Hall of the Wizengamot, which is most ancient because the wars
ended with the building of this place.</p>
<p>This is the Hall of the Wizengamot; there are older places, but
they are hidden. Legend holds that the walls of dark stone were
conjured, created, willed into existence by Merlin, when he
gathered the most powerful wizards left in the world and awed them
into accepting him as their chief. And when (the legend continues)
the Seers continued to foretell that not enough had yet been done
to prevent the end of the world and its magic, then (the story
goes) Merlin sacrificed his life, and his wizardry, and his time,
to lay in force the Interdict of Merlin. It was not an act without
cost, for a place like this one could not be raised again by any
power still known to wizardkind. Nor yet destroyed, for those walls
of dark stone would pass unharmed, and perhaps unwarmed, through
the heart of a nuclear explosion. It is a pity that nobody knows
how to make them anymore.</p>
<p>In the highest of the rising half-circles of the Wizengamot, on
the topmost level of dark stone, there is a podium. At that podium
stands an old man, with care-lined face and a silver beard that
stretches down below his waist; this is Albus Percival Wulfric
Brian Dumbledore. His right hand bears a wand of power, upon his
shoulder perches a bird of fire. His left hand holds a short rod,
thin and featureless and forged of the same dark stone as the
walls, and this is the Line of Merlin Unbroken, the device of the
Chief Warlock. Karen Dutton bequeathed the Line to Albus Dumbledore
on the last day of her life, scant hours after he returned
half-dead from his defeat of Grindelwald with a phoenix flaming
brightly at his side. She in turn received the Line from the
perfectionist Nicodemus Capernaum, each wizard passing it to their
chosen successor, back and back in unbroken chain to the day Merlin
laid down his life. That (if you were wondering) is how the country
of magical Britain managed to elect Cornelius Fudge for its
Minister, and yet end up with Albus Dumbledore for its Chief
Warlock. Not by law (for written law can be rewritten) but by most
ancient tradition, the Wizengamot does not choose who shall preside
over its follies. Since the day of Merlin's sacrifice, the most
important duty of any Chief Warlock has been to exercise the
highest caution in their choice of people who are both good and
able to discern good successors. You would expect that chain of
light to miss a step, sometime down through the centuries; that it
would go astray at least once, and then never return. But it has
not. The Line of Merlin continues, unbroken.</p>
<p>(Or so say those of Dumbledore's faction. Lord Malfoy would tell
you otherwise. And in Asia they tell other tales entirely, which
may not make Britain's version wrong.)</p>
<p>Upon the bottommost platform of the Ancient Hall there is a
high-backed chair, legged and armed and without cushions, of dark
metal rather than dark stone, which Merlin did not place there.</p>
<p>The Ministry building that grew up around this place is
wood-paneled and gold-washed, bright and fire-lit, filled with
bustling foolishness. This place is different. It is the stone
heart of magical Britain, and it is neither gold-washed nor
wood-paneled, neither fire-lit nor bright.</p>
<p>Filing solemnly into this room are witches and wizards in
plum-colored robes each embroidered with a silver W. They carry
themselves with an air of seriousness showing that they are well
aware that they are terribly, terribly important. They are meeting
in the Most Ancient Hall, after all. They are the Lords and Ladies
of the Wizengamot, and they consider themselves the greatest folk
of the world's greatest magical country. Lesser folk have fallen
before them on bended knee in supplication; they are powerful, they
are wealthy, they are noble; are they not great?</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore knows everyone in this room by name. He has
taught many of them, though too few have learned. Some are his
allies, some his opponents, the rest he courts within the careful
dance of their neutrality. All of them, to him, are people.</p>
<p>The current Defense Professor of Hogwarts, if you asked him for
his opinion of the Lords and Ladies, would say that while many of
them are ambitious, few have any ambition. He would observe that
the Wizengamot is exactly where someone like that would end up -
that it is exactly the sort of opportunity you would grasp, if you
had nothing better to do. Such folk are rarely interesting, but
they are often useful; pieces to be manipulated, points to be
scored, by the true players of the game.</p>
<p>Not among the rising half-circles, but off to one side among a
raised arc for the spectators, next to a witch in pointed hat whose
face is lined with apprehension, there sits a boy dressed in the
most formal black robes that he owns. His eyes are green ice and
abstraction, and he hardly glances at the Lords and Ladies as they
bustle in. To him they are just a collection of murmuring
plum-colored robes to decorate the wooden benches, visual
background for the scene of the Most Ancient Hall. If there is an
enemy here, or something to be manipulated, it is merely "the
Wizengamot". The wealthy elites of magical Britain have collective
force, but not individual agency; their goals are too alien and
trivial for them to have personal roles in the tale. As of now,
this present time, the boy neither likes nor dislikes the
plum-colored robes, because his brain does not assign them enough
agenthood to be the subjects of moral judgment. He is a PC, and
they are wallpaper.</p>
<p>This view is about to change.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry gazed unseeing around the hall of the Wizengamot; it
looked quite old and historic and there was no doubt that Hermione
could have lectured him about the place for hours on end. The
plum-colored robes had stopped arriving, and Harry's pocketwatch,
advancing at the rate of three minutes every half-hour, said that
the trial was almost due to start.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall was sitting beside him, and her eyes never
left him for more than twenty consecutive seconds.</p>
<p>Harry had read the <em>Daily Prophet</em> that morning. The
headline had been "MAD MUGGLEBORN TRIES TO END ANCIENT LINE" and
the rest of the paper had been the same. When Harry was nine years
old the IRA had blown up a British barracks, and he'd watched on TV
as all the politicians contested to see who could be the most
loudly outraged. And the thought had occurred to Harry - even then,
before he'd known much about psychology - that it looked like
<em>everyone</em> was competing to see who could be most angry, and
<em>nobody</em> would've been allowed to suggest that anyone was
being <em>too</em> angry, even if they'd just proposed the
saturation nuclear bombing of Ireland. He'd been struck, even then,
by an essential emptiness in the indignation of politicians -
though he hadn't had the words to describe it, at that age - a
sense that they were trying to score cheap points by hitting at the
same safe target as everyone else.</p>
<p>Harry had always possessed that sense of hollowness about
political indignation, but it was strange how very much more
obvious it seemed, when you were reading a dozen articles in the
<em>Daily Prophet</em> beating on Hermione Granger.</p>
<p>The leading article, written by some name that Harry didn't
recognize, had called for the minimum age for Azkaban to be
lowered, just so that the twisted mudblood who had defaced the
honor of Scotland with her savage, unprovoked attack upon the last
heir of a Most Ancient House within the sacred refuge of Hogwarts
could be sent to the Dementors that were the only punishment
commensurate with the severity of her unspeakable crime. Only this
would be enough to discourage any other foreign, subhuman brutes
who similarly believed in their twisted insanity that they could
evade the majesty of the Wizengamot's inevitable and merciless
scourging of all that threatened the honorable nobility of etcetera
etcetera etcetera.</p>
<p>The next article had said the same thing in less eloquent
words.</p>
<p>Earlier, Albus Dumbledore had told him,</p>
<p><em>"I will not try to keep you from this trial." The old
wizard's voice quiet and unyielding. "I can well foresee how that
would go. But I would have you treat me with equal courtesy in
return. The politics of the Wizengamot are delicate, and of them
you know nothing. Dare any folly and it shall be to Hermione
Granger's cost; and you will remember that folly for the rest of
your days, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres."</em></p>
<p><em>"I understand," Harry said. "I know. Just - if you're
planning to pull a rabbit out of your hat and save the day at the
last minute when everything seems lost, please tell me now instead
of letting me sit and worry -"</em></p>
<p><em>"I would not do that to you," the old wizard said, a
terrible weariness seeming to suffuse him as he turned to go.
"Still less to Hermione. But I have no rabbits in my hat, Harry. We
can only see what Lucius Malfoy wants."</em></p>
<p>There was a small sharp rap, a single brief sound that somehow
silenced the entire room and caused Harry's head to jerk around and
upward. High above, Dumbledore had just tapped his podium with the
dark rod he held in his left hand.</p>
<p>"The ninetieth session of the two-hundred-and-eighth Wizengamot
is convened at the request of Lord Lucius Malfoy," the old wizard
said tonelessly.</p>
<p>At once, far to the side of the podium but also in the highest
circle, rose a tall man with a mane of long white spilling down
from his head over the shoulders of his plum-colored robes. "I
present a witness for questioning under Veritaserum," Lucius Malfoy
said, his cool tone clear throughout the room, smoothly controlled
with only a slight undertone of righteous fury. "Let Hermione, the
first Granger, be brought forth."</p>
<p>"I ask you all to remember that she is a first-year of
Hogwarts," Dumbledore said. "I will brook no abuse of this witness
-"</p>
<p>Someone in the benches quite audibly said "Pfah!" and there was
a spread of disgusted snorts, even one or two jeers.</p>
<p>Harry stared at the plum-colored robes, his eyes narrowing.</p>
<p>And with the growing anger came something else, a rising sense
of disquiet, of something horribly skewed, like reality itself was
being disrupted. Harry knew that, somehow, but he couldn't figure
out what was awry, or why his mind thought it was getting
worse...</p>
<p>"<em>Order!</em> " Dumbledore bellowed. He rapped the stone rod
twice against the podium, producing two more small clicks that
overrode all noise. "I will have order here!"</p>
<p>The door through which the witness was brought forth was set
directly beneath Harry's own seat, so it wasn't until the entire
group had emerged fully into the stone hall that Harry saw -</p>
<p>- an Auror trio -</p>
<p>- Hermione's back was to Harry as she was brought out, he
couldn't see her face -</p>
<p>- followed by a shining silver sparrow and a running moonlit
squirrel -</p>
<p>- and the source of the horrible wrongness, half-hidden beneath
a tattered cloak.</p>
<p>Harry shot to his feet before he could even think, it was only
Professor McGonagall's sudden frantic grab on his wrist that
stopped his hand going for his wand; and the Transfiguration
Professor whispered desperately, "<em>Harry it's all right there's
a Patronus -</em>"</p>
<p>It took a few seconds for Harry to remember himself. For the
part of himself that understood that Hermione hadn't been directly
exposed to a Dementor, to argue his other parts into something like
sanity -</p>
<p><em>But animal Patronuses aren't perfect,</em> said another
voice inside his mind. <em>Or Dumbledore wouldn't see the form of a
naked man painful to look upon. You felt it approaching, animal
Patronus or no...</em></p>
<p>Slowly, Harry Potter sat back down again as Professor McGonagall
pulled down with her grip on his wrist.</p>
<p>But by then he'd already declared war on the country of magical
Britain, and the idea of other people calling him a Dark Lord no
longer seemed important one way or another.</p>
<p>Hermione's face became visible to him, as she sat down in the
chair. She wasn't upright and defiant like she'd been in front of
Snape, she wasn't crying like she'd been when the Aurors arrested
her. She just sat there with a look of vacant horror as dark metal
chains snaked out from the chair and bound her arms and legs.</p>
<p>Harry couldn't take it. Without even thinking he was trying to
flee inside himself, flee into his dark side, pull the cold rage
over himself like a shield. It took too long, he hadn't tried to go
fully into his dark side since Azkaban. And then when his blood was
something like cold, he looked up again, and saw Hermione in the
chair again, and discovered that his dark side knew nothing about
how to deal with this type of pain, it pierced through the coldness
like a knife and didn't hurt less in the slightest.</p>
<p>"Why, if it isn't Harry Potter!" came a high, light female
voice, sickly sweet and indulgent.</p>
<p>Slowly, Harry turned his head away from the chair and saw a
smiling woman wearing so much makeup that her skin looked almost
pink, sitting next to a man that Harry recognized from photographs
as Minister Cornelius Fudge.</p>
<p>"Did you have something to say, Mr. Potter?" inquired the woman,
as cheerfully as if this wasn't a trial.</p>
<p>Other people were also looking at him now.</p>
<p>Harry couldn't speak, all the words in his mind would have been
stupid to speak aloud. He couldn't find anything to say that
Neville could also have said. Dumbledore had warned Harry that if
anyone <em>else</em> wanted the Boy-Who-Lived to speak, he must
<em>pretend to be his age</em> -</p>
<p>"The Headmaster said I shouldn't ought to talk," the boy said,
not quite able to keep the edge out of his voice.</p>
<p>"Oh, but you have <em>our</em> permission to talk!" the woman
said brightly. "I'm sure the Wizengamot is always happy to hear
from the Boy-Who-Lived!" Beside her, Minister Cornelius Fudge was
nodding.</p>
<p>The woman's face was puffy and overweight, visibly pale beneath
the makeup. Almost inevitably, a certain word came to mind, and
that word was <em>toad.</em> Which, said Harry's logical part,
shouldn't correlate to morality in any way. Only in Disney movies
were ugly people more likely to be evil and vice versa; and those
movies were probably scripted by writers who'd never been ugly.
He'd give her a chance, everyone in this room deserved one
chance...</p>
<p>"Because I got rid of the Dark Lord?" the boy said, and pointed
at the Dementor where it was hovering behind Hermione's chair.
"There's something in this room that's Darker."</p>
<p>The woman's face narrowed, growing a little stern. "I realize a
young boy like yourself may be scared by them, Mr. Potter, but the
Dementors are quite obedient to the Ministry of Magic. And they
would, of course, be necessary to guard -"</p>
<p>"A twelve-year-old girl?" the boy yelled. "Those are the Darkest
creatures in the whole world, I could feel it coming here even
through the Patronus - the <em>wrongness</em> coming nearer - it's
horribly evil and it - it'd eat everyone in this room, if it could!
It shouldn't be let near any child, ever! Not me, not her, not
anyone! You ought to vote to send it away!"</p>
<p>"We'll <em>certainly</em> have no such vote -" the toad-woman
snapped.</p>
<p>"That's enough, Madam Umbridge, Mr. Potter," came Dumbledore's
stern voice from high above. And then after a short pause, the old
wizard went on, "Although, of course, the boy is correct on every
count."</p>
<p>Some of the members of the Wizengamot were looking abashed at
the Boy-Who-Lived's admonition, and a few others were nodding
violently to the old wizard's words. But they were too few. Harry
could see it. They were too few.</p>
<p>The Veritaserum was brought in then, and Hermione looked for a
brief moment like she <em>was</em> about to sob, she was looking at
Harry - no, at Professor McGonagall - and Professor McGonagall was
mouthing words that Harry couldn't make out from his angle. Then
Hermione swallowed three drops of Veritaserum and her face grew
slack.</p>
<p>"Gawain Robards," said the smooth voice of Lucius Malfoy. "Your
probity is known to all of us. If you would do the honors?"</p>
<p>One of the three Aurors stepped forward.</p>
<p>After the first few questions Harry looked away and stared off
to one side with his fingers in his ears, as Hermione's brain
played back the contents of the False Memory Charm. He couldn't
handle the drug-dulled anguish in Hermione's voice as she recounted
the false memories, and his dark side couldn't handle it either,
and he'd already heard the contents summarized.</p>
<p>Harry's mind flashed back to another day of horror, and even
though Harry had been on the verge of writing off Lord Voldemort's
continued existence as the senility of an old wizard, it suddenly
seemed horribly and uniquely plausible that the entity who'd
Memory-Charmed Hermione was the very same mind that had - <em>made
use of</em> - Bellatrix Black. The two events had a certain
signature in common. To choose that this should happen,
<em>plan</em> for this to happen - it would take more than evil, it
would take <em>emptiness</em>.</p>
<p>Harry looked up for a moment, then, and saw that the
plum-colored robes were watching, just watching.</p>
<p>Some time later, after all the stars in the night sky had gone
cold and dark and the last light in the Universe had sputtered down
to embers and gone black, the questioning of Hermione ended.</p>
<p>"If it pleases my Lords," said the voice of Lord Malfoy, "I
should like to have the testimony of my son Draco, witnessed under
two drops of Veritaserum, read aloud at this time."</p>
<p><em>Until she went after me in that battle, I wasn't plotting
anything against Granger. But after that day I really was feeling
insulted, I'd helped her all those times -</em></p>
<p>The sound that came from Hermione's throat was like she'd just
been crushed under a falling stone, so huge that she couldn't cry
or breathe, just a small sad gasp.</p>
<p>"Pardon me," said one witch from what seemed to be the
Malfoy-aligned side of the room. "But Lord Malfoy, why would your
son <em>help</em> this mudblood girl?"</p>
<p>"My son," Lucius Malfoy said in a heavy voice, "seems to have
been listening to certain misguided ideas. He is young - and he has
learned, now, we have all seen as a country, what such folly brings
in repayment."</p>
<p>A few steps down along the visitor's benches, a man wearing a
newsman's cap and a badge identifying him as belonging to the
<em>Daily Prophet</em> was avidly scribbling with a long quill.</p>
<p>The few people who'd nodded along to Dumbledore earlier had
rather sick looks on their faces. One witch in plum-colored robes
quite deliberately stood up from what had seemed like Dumbledore's
side of the room, and made her way over toward the Malfoy side.</p>
<p>The Auror went on reading, his voice monotone.</p>
<p><em>I'd been so tired from casting all those locking wards, I
was weak when I cast the last one. I thought I was stronger than
Granger but I wasn't certain, so I tested it empirically by
challenging her to a duel, that's why I d-d-did it and also because
if I'd won I was planning to beat her again the next day where
everyone could see. Stupid Veritaserum. But</em> she <em>didn't
know about that when she tried to</em> kill <em>me! And I really
was insulted by what she'd done, I really had helped her before and
I hadn't been planning anything against her then, only</em> she
<em>went after</em> me <em>in front of everyone!"</em></p>
<p>When all the witness testimony was done, the deliberations of
the Wizengamot began.</p>
<p>If you could call them that.</p>
<p>It seemed that many members of the Wizengamot were of the strong
opinion that murder was bad.</p>
<p>The plum-colored robes on Dumbledore's side of the room were
silent, the supposed forces of good saving their political capital
for more winnable battles. And Harry could hear, as though
Professor Quirrell were standing next to him, a dry voice in his
mind; explaining to him that it would hardly have been to the
politicians' own advantage to speak, just then.</p>
<p>But there was one wizard in the room whose status was high
enough that he had, it seemed, transcended his caution against
losing face; one wizard alone whose status was high enough that he
could speak a word of sanity and escape unscathed. He alone spoke
to defend Hermione, the man with a phoenix flaming bright upon his
shoulder.</p>
<p>Only Albus Dumbledore spoke.</p>
<p>The Chief Warlock didn't raise the possibility that Hermione
Granger was entirely innocent. That, the Headmaster had explained
to Harry, would not be believed, would only make it worse.</p>
<p>But Albus Dumbledore said, in one gentle reminder after another,
that the perpetrator was a first-year girl in Hogwarts; that many
had done foolish things during their youth; that a first-year in
Hogwarts was simply too young to comprehend the consequences of her
acts. He himself (the Chief Warlock said quietly) had attempted
certain foolish things during his childhood, when he was well older
than she.</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore said that Hermione Granger had been beloved of
all the Hogwarts faculty, and helped four Hufflepuff girls with
their Charms homework, and had scored one hundred and three points
for Ravenclaw over the course of the school year.</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore said that nobody who knew Hermione Granger
would be anything but shocked by these events. That they had, all
of them, heard the horror in her voice as she recounted her
testimony. And if some unusual madness had temporarily possessed
her, then - his voice rising in stern command - she deserved
nothing from them except sympathy and a healer's attentions.</p>
<p>And at the last, Albus Dumbledore reminded the Wizengamot, over
cries of protest, that the charge was <em>attempted</em> murder and
not murder. Albus Dumbledore said, over a rising storm of
objections, that no lasting harm had come to anyone. And Albus
Dumbledore begged them not to do worse themselves than anything
that had yet been done -</p>
<p>"<em>Enough!</em> " bellowed Lucius Malfoy, and a show of hands
ended the deliberations. The white-maned man stood tall and
terrible, his silver cane held high in one hand like a gavel about
to fall. "For what this mad woman has tried to do to my son - for
the blood debt that she owes for trying to end the line of a Noble
and Most Ancient House - I say that she will -"</p>
<p>"Azkaban!" roared a man with a scarred face, seated at Lord
Malfoy's right hand. "Send the mad mudblood to Azkaban!"</p>
<p>"Azkaban!" cried another plum-colored robe, and then another,
and another -</p>
<p>A click from the rod in Dumbledore's hand silenced the room.
"You are out of order," the old wizard said sternly. "And your
proposal is barbaric, beneath the dignity of this assembly. There
are things we do not do. Lord Malfoy?"</p>
<p>Lucius Malfoy had listened to this with an impassive face.
"Well," Lord Malfoy said after a few moments. A cold gleam lit his
eyes. "I had not planned to ask it. But if that is the will of the
Wizengamot - then let her pay as any in her place would pay. Let it
be Azkaban."</p>
<p>A great cheer of rage went up -</p>
<p>"Are you all <em>lost?</em> " cried Albus Dumbledore. "She is
too young! Her mind would not withstand it! Not in three centuries
has such a thing been done in Britain!"</p>
<p>"What will the other countries think of us?" said the sharp
voice of a woman that Harry recognized as Neville's
grandmother.</p>
<p>"Will <em>you</em> guard Azkaban after she goes there, Lord
Malfoy?" said a stern old witch that Harry didn't know. "For my
Aurors may decline to guard it, I fear, if small children are kept
within."</p>
<p>"The deliberations are ended," Lucius Malfoy said coldly. "But
if you are incapable of finding Aurors who can obey the vote of the
Wizengamot, Madam Bones, you may relinquish the position; we can
easily find another to serve in your place. The will of this Hall
is clear. For the monstrosity of her crimes, the girl is to be
tried as an adult and punished accordingly; ten years in Azkaban,
the justice for attempted murder."</p>
<p>When the old wizard spoke again, his voice was lower. "Is there
no alternative to this, Lucius? We may retire to my chambers to
discuss it, if need be."</p>
<p>The tall man of the long white hair turned, then, to regard
where the old wizard stood at the podium; and the two stared at
each other for a long moment.</p>
<p>When Lucius Malfoy spoke again his voice seemed to tremble ever
so slightly, as though the stern control on it was failing. "Blood
calls for repayment, the blood of my family. Not for any price will
I sell the blood debt owed my son. You would not understand that,
who never had love or child of your own. Still, there is more than
one debt owed to House Malfoy, and I think that my son, if he stood
among us, would rather be repaid for his mother's blood than for
his own. Confess your own crime to the Wizengamot, as you confessed
it to me, and I shall -"</p>
<p>"Don't even think about it, Albus," said the stern old witch who
had spoken before.</p>
<p>The old wizard stood at the podium.</p>
<p>The old wizard stood at the podium, his face twisting,
untwisting -</p>
<p>"Stop it," said the old witch. "You know the answer you must
give, Albus. It will not change for agonizing over it."</p>
<p>The old wizard spoke.</p>
<p>"No," said Albus Dumbledore.</p>
<p>"And you, Malfoy," continued the stern old witch, "I suppose all
you really wanted this whole time was to ruin -"</p>
<p>"Hardly," said Lucius Malfoy, his lips now twisting into a
bitter smile. "No, I have no purpose here but my son's vengeance. I
only wished to show the Wizengamot the truth behind this old man's
pretended heroism and his praise of that girl - that he would
hardly think of sacrificing himself to save her."</p>
<p>"Cruelty worthy of a Death Eater indeed," said Augusta
Longbottom. "Not that I'm implying anything, of course."</p>
<p>"Cruelty?" said Lucius Malfoy, the bitter smile still on his
face. "I think not. I knew what his answer would be. I have ever
warned you that he only plays his pretended part. If you believe in
his hesitation, the more fool you. Remember that his answer was the
same." The man raised his voice. "Let us vote, my friends. I think
a show of hands will suffice for it. I do not imagine there will be
many who choose to align themselves with murderers." The voice went
cold, on the last note, the promise in it very clear.</p>
<p>"Look at the girl," said Albus Dumbledore. "See her, see the
horror you are committing! She is -" The old wizard's voice broke.
"She is afraid -"</p>
<p>The Veritaserum must have been wearing off, because Hermione
Granger's face was twisting beneath the slackness, her limbs
trembling visibly beneath the chains, as though she were trying to
run, run from that chair, but was pressed down by weights larger
than the enchanted metal links that bound her. Then there was a
convulsive effort and Hermione's neck moved, her head twisted,
enough to bring her eyes into line -</p>
<p>She looked at Harry Potter and though she didn't speak, it was
absolutely clear what she was saying.</p>
<p><em>Harry</em></p>
<p><em>help me</em></p>
<p><em>please -</em></p>
<p>And in the Most Ancient Hall of the Wizengamot an icy voice rang
out, speech the color of liquid nitrogen, pitched too high for that
it came from too young a throat, and that voice said, "<em>Lucius
Malfoy.</em>"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>In the ancient and hallowed halls of the Wizengamot, people
looked around and it took their eyes too long to find what they
sought. It might have been high in pitch, it might have been
under-loud for the words being spoken; and yet even so, you
wouldn't have expected to hear that voice from a child.</p>
<p>It wasn't until Lord Malfoy spoke in return that people even
realized where they should be looking.</p>
<p>"Harry Potter," said Lucius Malfoy. He did not incline his
head.</p>
<p>Heads spun, eyes moved, and people focused on the messy-haired
young boy standing near the weeping older witch. The boy stood
merely chest-high with his shoes on, dressed in short robes of
formal black. Though unless your eyes were keen indeed, you
couldn't have seen, from all the way across the Hall, that famous
and deadly scar beneath his messy hair.</p>
<p>"This folly does not become you, Lucius," said the boy.
"Twelve-year-old girls do not go around committing murders. You are
a Slytherin and an intelligent one. You know this is a plot.
Hermione Granger was placed on this gameboard by force, by whatever
hand lies behind that plot. <em>You</em> were surely intended to
act just as you are acting now - except that Draco Malfoy was meant
to be dead, and you were meant to be beyond all reason. But he is
alive and you are sane. Why are you cooperating with your intended
role, in a plot meant to take the life of your son?"</p>
<p>A storm seemed to be raging inside Lucius, the face beneath the
flowing white hair threatening to crack open and spill something
unguessable. The Lord of Malfoy seemed to almost speak once and
then twice again, swallowing three unheard sentences before his
lips parted for true. "A plot, you say?" Lord Malfoy said at last.
His face was twitching, hardly controlled. "And whose plot would
that be, then?"</p>
<p>"If I knew," said the boy, "I would have said so a good deal
earlier. But anyone who had ever been Hermione Granger's classmate
could tell you that she is a most unlikely murderess. She does, in
fact, help Hufflepuffs with their homework. This was not a natural
event, Lord Malfoy."</p>
<p>"Plot - or no plot -" Lucius's voice was trembling. "This
mudblood filth has touched my son and for that I will end her. You
should know that full well, <em>Harry Potter</em>."</p>
<p>"It is questionable," the boy said, "to put it mildly, whether
Hermione Granger actually cast that Blood-Cooling Charm. I do not
know the exact circumstances or what spells were involved, but
simple trickery would not have sufficed to make her do it. She did
not act of her own will, and perhaps did not act at all. Your
vengeance is being misdirected, Lord Malfoy, and deliberately so.
It is not a twelve-year-old girl who deserves your ire."</p>
<p>"And what do <em>you</em> care for her fate?" Lucius Malfoy's
voice was rising. "What is <em>your</em> stake in this?"</p>
<p>"She is my friend," the boy said, "as Draco is my friend. It is
possible that this blow was aimed at me, and not at House Malfoy at
all."</p>
<p>Again the muscles jumped in Lucius's face. "And now you are
lying to me - as you lied to my son!"</p>
<p>"Believe it or not," the boy said quietly, "I never willed
anything but that Draco should know the truth -"</p>
<p>"<em>Enough!</em> " cried the Lord Malfoy. "Enough of your lies!
Enough of your <em>games!</em> You do not understand - you would
never understand - what it means that he is my son! I will not be
denied this vengeance! No more! Never again! For the blood this
girl owes House Malfoy, she shall go to Azkaban. And if I ever find
another hand at work - even if it is your own - that hand shall be
cut off as well!" Lucius Malfoy raised his deadly silver cane as
though in command, his teeth clenched and his lips drawn back in a
snarl, like a wolf facing a dragon. "And if you have nothing better
to say than that - be silent, Harry Potter!"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry's blood was hammering even beneath the ice of his dark
side, the fear for Hermione, the part of him that wanted to lash
out at Lucius and destroy him where he stood for his insolence and
his <em>stupidity -</em> but Harry didn't have the <em>power,</em>
he didn't even have a single vote in the Wizengamot -</p>
<p>Draco had said that Lucius was scared of him, for some unknown
reason. And Harry could see it in the rictus that Lord Malfoy's
face had become, drawn and tight, that it was taking all his
courage for him to tell Harry to shut up.</p>
<p>So Harry said, his voice cool and deadly, hoping to hell that it
meant something, "You will earn my enmity if you do this thing,
Lucius..."</p>
<p>Someone in the lower rows of what was evidently the blood-purist
side of the Wizengamot, who was looking down at the young boy
rather than up at Lord Malfoy, laughed in outright incredulity.
Other plum-colored robes began to laugh as well.</p>
<p>Lord Malfoy gazed at him with hard dignity, as that laughter
spread. "If you want the enmity of the House of Malfoy, you shall
have it, <em>child</em>."</p>
<p>"Now really," said the woman in too much pink makeup, "I think
this has gone on quite long enough, wouldn't you say, Lord Malfoy?
The boy will miss his classes."</p>
<p>"Indeed he will," said Lucius Malfoy, and then raised his voice
again. "I call the vote! By show of hands, let the Wizengamot
acknowledge the blood debt owed to the Noble and Most Ancient House
of Malfoy, for the attempted murder of its last scion and ending of
its line, by Hermione, the first Granger!"</p>
<p>Hands shot up one after another, and the secretary who sat in
the bottom circle began to make marks on parchment to tally them,
but it was obvious which way the majority had gone.</p>
<p>And Harry screamed inside his mind, a frantic call for help to
any part of himself that would offer a way out, a strategy, an
idea. But there was nothing, there was nothing, he'd played his
last cards and lost. And then with a last convulsive desperation
Harry plunged himself into his dark side, pushed himself into his
dark side, seizing at its deadly clarity, offering his dark side
anything if it would only solve this problem for him; and at last
the lethal calm came over him, the true ice finally answering his
call. Beyond all panic and despair his mind began to search through
every fact in its possession, recall everything it knew about
Lucius Malfoy, about the Wizengamot, about the laws of magical
Britain; his eyes looked at the rows of chairs, at every person and
every thing within range of his vision, searching for any
opportunity it could grasp -</p>

<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 85: Taboo Tradeoffs, Aftermath 3,
Distance<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p><em>This chapter received a major, significiant revision on
December 16th, 2012. The main revision starts about halfway through
- search on the word "trivial" to find it.</em></p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Slow and hard, the long stairway that led to the peak of
Ravenclaw. From the inside, the stairway seemed like a straight
upward slope, though from the outside you could see that it
logically had to be a spiral. You could only get to the top of the
Ravenclaw tower by making that long climb without shortcuts, stone
step by stone step; passing beneath Harry's shoes, pushed down by
his wearying legs.</p>
<p>Harry had seen Hermione safely off to bed.</p>
<p>He had lingered in the Ravenclaw common room long enough to
collect a few signatures that might be useful to Hermione later.
Not many students had signed; wizards hadn't been trained to think
in the put-up-or-shut-up,
stick-your-neck-out-and-make-a-prediction-or-stop-pretending-to-believe-in-your-theory
rules of Muggle science. Most of them hadn't seen anything
<em>incongruent</em> about being too nervous to sign an agreement
saying that Hermione got to hold it over them for the rest of their
lives if they were wrong, while acting outwardly confident that she
was guilty. But just having demanded the signatures would make the
point after the truth came out, if anyone ever again suspected
Hermione of anything Dark. She wouldn't have to go through this
<em>twice,</em> at least.</p>
<p>After that Harry had left the common room quickly, because all
the kindly forgiving sentiments he'd reasoned out were getting
harder and harder to remember. Sometimes Harry thought the deepest
split in his personality wasn't anything to do with his dark side;
rather it was the divide between the altruistic and forgiving
Abstract Reasoning Harry, versus the frustrated and angry Harry In
The Moment.</p>
<p>The circular platform at the top of the Ravenclaw tower wasn't
the tallest place in Hogwarts, but the Ravenclaw tower jutted out
from the main body of the castle, so you couldn't see down into the
top platform from the Astronomy tower. A quiet place to think, if
you had an awful lot to think about. A place where few other
students ever came - there were easier niches of privacy, if
privacy was all you wanted.</p>
<p>The night-lit torches of Hogwarts were far below. The platform
itself offered few obstructions; the stairs emerged from an
uncovered gap in the floor, rather than an upright door. From this
place, then, the stars were as visible as they ever were on
Earth.</p>
<p>The boy lay down in the center of the platform, heedless of his
robes that might be dirtied, dropping his head to rest upon the
rock-tiled floor; so that, except for a few half-seen crenellations
of stone at vision's edge, and a sliver of crescent moon, reality
became starlight.</p>
<p>The pinpoints of light in dark velvet twinkled, wavering and
returning, a different kind of beauty from their steady brilliance
in the Silent Night.</p>
<p>Harry gazed out abstractly, his mind on other things.</p>
<p><em>This day your war against Voldemort has begun...</em></p>
<p>Dumbledore had said that, after the Incident with Rescuing
Bellatrix from Azkaban. That had been a false alarm, but the phrase
expressed the sentiment well.</p>
<p>Two nights ago his war had begun, and Harry didn't know with
<em>who</em>.</p>
<p>Dumbledore thought it was Lord Voldemort, returned from the
dead, making his first move against the boy who had defeated him
last time.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell had put detection wards on Draco, fearing
that Hogwarts's mad Headmaster would try to frame Harry for the
death of Lucius's son.</p>
<p>Or Professor Quirrell had set up the entire thing, and
<em>that</em> was how he'd known where to find Draco. Severus Snape
thought the Hogwarts Defense Professor was an obvious suspect, even
<em>the</em> obvious suspect.</p>
<p>And Severus Snape himself might or might not be even remotely
trustworthy.</p>
<p><em>Someone</em> had declared war against Harry, their first
strike had been meant to take out Draco and Hermione both, and it
was only by the barest of margins that Harry had saved
Hermione.</p>
<p>You couldn't call it victory. Draco had been removed from
Hogwarts, and if that wasn't death, it wasn't clear how it could be
undone, or what shape Draco might be in when he got back. The
country of magical Britain now thought Hermione an
attempted-murderer, which might or might not make her decide to do
the sane thing and leave. Harry had sacrificed his entire fortune
to undo his loss, and that card could only be played once.</p>
<p>Some unknown power had struck at him, and if that blow had been
partially deflected, it had still hit <em>really hard.</em></p>
<p>At least his dark side hadn't asked anything of him in exchange
for saving Hermione. Maybe because his dark side <em>wasn't</em> an
imaginary voice like Hufflepuff; Harry might <em>imagine</em> his
Hufflepuff part as wanting different things from himself, but his
dark side wasn't like that. His "dark side", so far as Harry could
tell, was a different way that Harry sometimes <em>was</em>. Right
now, Harry wasn't angry; and trying to ask what "dark Harry" wanted
was a phone ringing unanswered. The thought even seemed a little
strange; could you owe something to a different way you sometimes
were?</p>
<p>Harry stared up at the random stars, the scattered twinkling
lights that human brains couldn't help but pattern-match into
imaginary constellations.</p>
<p>And then there was that promise Harry had sworn.</p>
<p>Draco to help Harry reform Slytherin House. And Harry to take as
an enemy whomever Harry believed, in his best judgment as a
rationalist, to have killed Narcissa Malfoy. If Narcissa had never
gotten her own hands dirty, if indeed she'd been burned alive, if
the killer hadn't been tricked - those were all the conditions
Harry could remember making. He probably should've written it down,
or better yet, never made a promise requiring that many caveats in
the first place.</p>
<p>There were plausible outs, for the sort of person who'd let
themselves rationalize an out. Dumbledore hadn't <em>actually</em>
confessed. He hadn't come right out and said he'd done it. There
were plausible reasons for an actually-guilty Dumbledore to behave
that way. But it was <em>also</em> what you'd expect to see, if
someone else had burned Narcissa, and Dumbledore had taken
credit.</p>
<p>Harry shook his head, flattening one side of his hair and then
another against the stone-tiled floor. There was still a final out,
Draco could still release him from the oath at any time. He could,
at least, describe the situation to Draco, and talk about options
with him, when they met again. It didn't seem like a very likely
prospect for release - but the idea of talking something over
honestly was enough to satisfy the part of himself that demanded
adherence to oaths. Even if it only meant delaying, it was better
than taking a good man as an enemy.</p>
<p><em>But</em> is <em>Dumbledore a good man?</em> asked the voice
of Hufflepuff. <em>If Dumbledore burned someone alive - wasn't the
whole point that good people may kill, but never kill with
suffering?</em></p>
<p><em>Maybe he killed her instantly,</em> said Slytherin, <em>and
then lied to Lucius about the burning-alive part. But... if there
was</em> any <em>possibility of the Death Eaters magically
verifying how Narcissa died... and if being caught in a lie
would've endangered Light-side families...</em></p>
<p><em>Be careful what we cleverly rationalize,</em> warned
Gryffindor.</p>
<p><em>You have to expect reputational effects on how other people
treat you,</em> said Hufflepuff. <em>If you decide there's
sufficient reason to burn a woman alive, one of the predictable
side effects is that good people decide you've crossed the line and
have to be stopped. Dumbledore should've expected that. He's got no
right to complain.</em></p>
<p><em>Or maybe he expects us to be smarter,</em> said Slytherin.
<em>Now that we know this much of the truth - no matter the exact
details of the full story - can we really believe that Dumbledore
is a terrible, terrible person who ought to be our enemy? In the
middle of a horrible bloody war, Dumbledore set</em> one <em>enemy
civilian on fire? That's only bad by the standards of comic books,
not by any sort of realistic historical standard.</em></p>
<p>Harry stared up at the night sky, remembering history.</p>
<p>In real life, in real wars...</p>
<p>During World War II, there had been a project to sabotage the
Nazi nuclear weapons program. Years earlier, Leo Szilard, the first
person to realize the possibility of a fission chain reaction, had
convinced Fermi not to publish the discovery that purified graphite
was a cheap and effective neutron moderator. Fermi had wanted to
publish, for the sake of the great international project of
science, which was above nationalism. But Szilard had persuaded
Rabi, and Fermi had abided by the majority vote of their tiny
three-person conspiracy. And so, years later, the only neutron
moderator the Nazis had known about was deuterium.</p>
<p>The only deuterium source under Nazi control had been a captured
facility in occupied Norway, which had been knocked out by bombs
and sabotage, causing a total of twenty-four civilian deaths.</p>
<p>The Nazis had tried to ship the deuterium already refined to
Germany, aboard a civilian Norwegian ferry, the <em>SS
Hydro.</em></p>
<p>Knut Haukelid and his assistants had been discovered by the
night watchman of the civilian ferry while they were sneaking on
board to sabotage it. Haukelid had told the watchman that they were
escaping the Gestapo, and the watchman had let them go. Haukelid
had considered warning the night watchman, but that would have
endangered the mission, so Haukelid had only shaken his hand. And
the civilian ship had sunk in the deepest part of the lake, with
eight dead Germans, seven dead crew, and three dead civilian
bystanders. Some of the Norwegian rescuers of the ship had thought
the German soldiers present should be left to drown, but this view
had not prevailed, and the German survivors had been rescued. And
that had been the end of the Nazi nuclear weapons program.</p>
<p>Which was to say that Knut Haukelid had killed innocent people.
One of whom, the night watchman of the ship, had been a
<em>good</em> person. Someone who'd gone out of his way to help
Haukelid, at risk to himself; from the kindness of his heart, for
the highest moral reasons; and been sent to drown in turn.
Afterward, in the cold light of history, it had looked like the
Nazis had never been close to getting nuclear weapons after
all.</p>
<p>And Harry had never read anything suggesting that Haukelid had
acted wrongly.</p>
<p>That was war in real life. In terms of total damage and who'd
gotten hit, what Haukelid had done was considerably <em>worse</em>
than what Dumbledore might have done to Narcissa Malfoy, or what
Dumbledore had possibly done to leak the prophecy to Lord Voldemort
to get him to attack Harry's parents.</p>
<p>If Haukelid had been a comic-book superhero, he'd have somehow
gotten all the civilians off the ferry, he would've attacked the
German soldiers directly...</p>
<p>...rather than let a single innocent person die...</p>
<p>...but Knut Haukelid hadn't been a superhero.</p>
<p>And neither had been Albus Dumbledore.</p>
<p>Harry closed his eyes, swallowing hard a few times against the
sudden choking sensation. It was abruptly very clear that while
Harry was going around trying to live the ideals of the
Enlightenment, Dumbledore was the one who'd actually <em>fought in
a war</em>. Nonviolent ideals were cheap to hold if you were a
scientist, living inside the <em>Protego</em> bubble cast by the
police officers and soldiers whose actions you had the luxury to
question. Albus Dumbledore seemed to have started out with ideals
at least as strong as Harry's own, if not stronger; and Dumbledore
hadn't gotten through his war without killing enemies and
sacrificing friends.</p>
<p><em>Are you so much better than Haukelid and Dumbledore, Harry
Potter, that you'll be able to fight without a single casualty?
Even in the world of comic books, the only reason a superhero like
Batman even</em> looks <em>successful is that the comic-book
readers only notice when Important Named Characters die, not when
the Joker shoots some random nameless bystander to show off his
villainy. Batman is a murderer no less than the Joker, for all the
lives the Joker took that Batman could've saved by killing him.
That's what the man named Alastor was trying to tell Dumbledore,
and afterward Dumbledore regretted having taken so long to change
his mind. Are you really going to try to follow the path of the
superhero, and never sacrifice a single piece or kill a single
enemy?</em></p>
<p>Fatigued, Harry turned his attention away from the dilemma for a
moment, opened his eyes again to regard the hemisphere of night,
which required no decisions from him.</p>
<p>Near the edge of his vision, the pale white crescent of the
Moon, the light from which had left one-and-a-quarter seconds ago,
around 375,000 kilometers of distance in Earth's space of
simultaneity.</p>
<p>Above and to the side, Polaris, the North Star; the first star
Harry had learned to identify in the sky, by following the edge of
the Big Dipper. That was actually a five-star system with a
brilliant central supergiant, 434 light-years from Earth. It was
the first 'star' whose name Harry had ever learned from his father,
so long ago that he couldn't have guessed how old he'd been.</p>
<p>The dim fog that was the Milky Way, so many billions of distant
stars that they became an indistinct river, the plane of a galaxy
that stretched 100,000 light-years across. If Harry had experienced
any sense of wonder when he'd <em>first</em> been told that, he'd
been too young for him to remember now that first time, across a
few years' distance.</p>
<p>In the center of the constellation Andromeda, the star
Andromeda, which was really the Andromeda Galaxy. The nearest
galaxy to the Milky Way, 2.4 million light-years away, containing
an estimated trillion stars.</p>
<p>Numbers like those made 'infinity' pale by comparison, because
'infinity' was just featureless and blank. Thinking that the stars
were 'infinitely' distant was a lot less scary than trying to work
out what 2.4 million light-years amounted to in meters. 2.4 million
light-years, times 31 million seconds in a year, times a photon
moving at 300,000,000 meters per second...</p>
<p>It was strange to think that such distances might <em>not</em>
be unreachably far away. Magic was loose in the universe, things
like Time-Turners and broomsticks. Had any wizard ever tried to
measure the speed of a portkey, or a phoenix?</p>
<p>And the human understanding of magic couldn't possibly be
anywhere <em>near</em> the underlying laws. What would you be able
to do with magic if you <em>really</em> understood it?</p>
<p>A year ago, Dad had gone to the Australian National University
in Canberra for a conference where he'd been an invited speaker,
and he'd taken Mum and Harry along. And they'd all visited the
National Museum of Australia, because, it had turned out, there was
basically nothing else to do in Canberra. The glass display cases
had shown rock-throwers crafted by the Australian aborigines - like
giant wooden shoehorns, they'd looked, but smoothed and carved and
ornamented with painstaking care. In the 40,000 years since
anatomically modern humans had migrated to Australia from Asia,
nobody had invented the bow-and-arrow. It really made you
appreciate how <em>non-obvious</em> was the idea of Progress. Why
would you even think of Invention as something important, if all
your history's heroic tales were of great warriors and defenders
instead of Thomas Edison? How could anyone have suspected, while
carving a rock-thrower with painstaking care, that someday human
beings would invent rocket ships and nuclear energy?</p>
<p>Could you have looked up into the sky, at the brilliant light of
the Sun, and deduced that the universe contained greater sources of
power than mere fire? Would you have realized that if the
fundamental physical laws permitted it, someday humans would tap
the same energies as the Sun? Even if nothing you could imagine
doing with rock-throwers or woven pouches - no pattern of running
across the savannah and nothing you could obtain by hunting animals
- would accomplish that even in imagination?</p>
<p>It wasn't like modern-day Muggles had gotten anywhere near the
limits of what Muggle physics said was possible. And yet like
hunter-gatherers conceptually bound to their rock-throwers, most
Muggles lived in a world defined by the limits of what you could do
with cars and telephones. Even though Muggle physics explicitly
permitted possibilities like molecular nanotechnology or the
Penrose process for extracting energy from black holes, most people
filed that away in the same section of their brain that stored
fairy tales and history books, well away from their personal
realities: <em>Long ago and far away, ever so long ago.</em> No
surprise, then, that the wizarding world lived in a conceptual
universe bounded - not by fundamental laws of magic that nobody
even knew - but just by the surface rules of known Charms and
enchantments. You couldn't observe the way magic was practiced
nowadays and <em>not</em> be reminded of the National Museum of
Australia, once you realized what you were seeing. Even if Harry's
first guess had been mistaken, one way or another it was still
inconceivable that the <em>fundamental</em> laws of the universe
contained a special case for human lips shaping the phrase
'Wingardium Leviosa'. And yet even that fumbling grasp of magic was
enough to do things that Muggle physics said should be <em>forever
impossible:</em> the Time-Turner, water conjured out of nothingness
by <em>Aguamenti.</em> What were the <em>ultimate</em>
possibilities of invention, if the underlying laws of the universe
permitted an eleven-year-old with a stick to violate almost every
constraint in the Muggle version of physics?</p>
<p>Like a hunter-gatherer trying to look up at the Sun, and guess
that the universe had to be shaped in a way that allowed for
nuclear energy...</p>
<p>It made you wonder if maybe twenty thousand million million
million meters wasn't so much distance, after all.</p>
<p>There was a step beyond Abstract Reasoning Harry which he could
take, given time enough to compose himself and the right
surroundings; something beyond Abstract Reasoning Harry, as that
was beyond Harry In The Moment. Looking up at the stars, you could
try to imagine what the distant descendants of humanity would think
of your dilemma - in a hundred million years, when the stars would
have spun through great galactic movements into entirely new
positions, every constellation scattered. It was an elementary
theorem of probability that if you knew what your answer would be
after updating on future evidence, you ought to adopt that answer
right now. If you <em>knew</em> your destination, you were already
there. And by analogy, if not quite by theorem, if you could guess
what the descendants of humanity would think of something, you
ought to go ahead and take that as your own best guess.</p>
<p>From that vantage point the idea of killing off two-thirds of
the Wizengamot seemed a lot less appealing than it had a few hours
earlier. Even if you <em>had</em> to do it, even if you knew for a
solid fact that it would be the best thing for magical Britain and
that the complete Story of Time would look worse if you didn't do
it... even as a necessity, the deaths of sentient beings would
still be a tragedy. One more element of the sorrows of Earth; the
Most Ancient Earth from which everything had begun, long ago and
far away, ever so long ago.</p>
<p><em>He is not like Grindelwald</em>. <em>There is nothing human
left in him. Him you must destroy. Save your fury for that, and
that alone -</em></p>
<p>Harry shook his head slightly, tilting the stars a little in his
vision, as he lay on the stone floor looking upward and outward and
forward in time. Even if Dumbledore was right, and the true enemy
was utterly mad and evil... in a hundred million years the organic
lifeform known as Lord Voldemort probably wouldn't seem much
different from all the other bewildered children of Ancient Earth.
Whatever Lord Voldemort had done to himself, whatever Dark rituals
seemed so horribly irrevocable on a merely human scale, it wouldn't
be beyond curing with the technology of a hundred million years.
Killing him, even if you <em>had</em> to do it to save the lives of
others, would be just one more death for future sentient beings to
be sad about. How could you look up at the stars, and believe
anything else?</p>
<p>Harry stared up at the twinkling lights of Eternity and wondered
what the children's children's children would think of what
Dumbledore had maybe-done to Narcissa.</p>
<p>But even if you tried framing the question that way, asking what
humanity's descendants would think, it still drew only on your own
knowledge, not theirs. The answer still came from inside yourself,
and it could still be mistaken. If you didn't know the hundredth
decimal digit of pi yourself, then you didn't know how the
children's children's children would calculate it, for all that the
fact was trivial.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Slowly - he'd been lying there, looking at the stars, for longer
than he'd planned - Harry sat up from the ground. Pushing himself
to his feet, the muscles protesting, he walked over to the edge of
the stone platform at the height of the Ravenclaw tower. The stone
crenellations surrounding the edge of the tower weren't high, not
high enough to be safe. They were markers, clearly, rather than
railings. Harry didn't approach too close to the edge; there was no
point in taking chances. Looking down at the Hogwarts grounds
below, he was predictably feeling a sense of dizziness, the wobbly
affliction called vertigo. His brain was alarmed, it seemed,
because the ground below was so <em>distant</em>. It might have
been fully 50 meters away.</p>
<p>The lesson, it seemed, was that things had to be
<em>incredibly</em> close by before your brain could comprehend
them well enough to feel fear.</p>
<p>It was a rare brain that could feel strongly about anything, if
it wasn't close in space, close in time, near at hand, within easy
reach...</p>
<p>Before, Harry had imagined that going to Azkaban would require
planning and cooperation from a grownup confederate. Portkeys,
broomsticks, invisibility spells. Some way of getting to the bottom
levels without the Aurors noticing, so he could carve his way into
the central pit where the shadows of Death waited.</p>
<p>And that had been enough to put the prospect away, into the
future, safely apart from the <em>now</em>.</p>
<p>He hadn't realized until today that it might be as simple as
finding Fawkes and telling the phoenix that it was time.</p>
<p>Memories were rising up again, memories that Harry could never
manage to forget for long. Though the stones beneath his feet were
not smooth like metal, though the moonlit sky stretched all around
him, somehow it was very easy to imagine himself trapped in a long
metal corridor lit by dim orange light.</p>
<p>The night was quiet, quiet enough for memories to be clearly
audible.</p>
<p><em>No, I didn't mean it, please don't die!</em></p>
<p><em>No, I didn't mean it, please don't die!</em></p>
<p><em>Don't take it away, don't don't don't -</em></p>
<p>The world blurred, and Harry wiped his eyes with his sleeve.</p>
<p>If <em>Hermione</em> had been the one behind that door -</p>
<p>If Hermione had been put in Azkaban, Harry would have called the
phoenix and gone there and burned away every last Dementor and it
wouldn't have made a single difference how crazy it was or what
else he'd wanted to do with his life. That was just - that was -
that was just how it was.</p>
<p>And the woman who <em>was</em> behind that door - wasn't there
someone, somewhere, to whom she too was precious? Wasn't it only
Harry's distance from her life that was preventing his brain from
being driven to Azkaban to <em>save her no matter what?</em> What
would it have taken to compel him? Would he have needed to know her
face? Her name? Her favorite color? Would he have been driven to
Azkaban to save Tracey Davis? Would he have been compelled there to
save Professor McGonagall? Mum and Dad - there wasn't even any
question. And that woman had said she was someone's mother. How
many people had wished for the power to break Azkaban? How many
prisoners of Azkaban dreamed nightly of such a miraculous
rescue?</p>
<p><em>None. It's a happy thought.</em></p>
<p>Maybe he <em>should</em> harrow Azkaban. All he had to do was
find Fawkes and tell him it was time. Visualize the center of the
Dementor's pit as he'd seen it from the broomstick, and let the
phoenix take him there. Cast the True Patronus Charm at point-blank
range and to hell with what came after.</p>
<p>All he had to do was go find Fawkes.</p>
<p>It might be as simple as thinking of the flame, calling for the
fire-bird in his heart -</p>
<p>A star flashed in the night.</p>
<p>By the time Harry's eyes had jumped with a reflex action trained
on meteor showers, another part of him was surprised that the
astronomical phenomenon was still there; a faint star whose
brightness was slowly visibly waxing. There was a startled moment
when Harry wondered whether he was seeing, not a meteor, but a nova
or supernova - could you <em>see</em> them getting brighter like
that? Was the first stage of a nova supposed to be that
yellow-orange color?</p>
<p>Then the new star moved again, and seemed to grow as well as
brightening. It looked <em>closer</em> suddenly, no longer so far
away that distance became moot. Like what you thought was a star,
turning out to be an airplane, a lighted form whose shape you could
actually see...</p>
<p>...no, not a plane...</p>
<p>The realization seemed to spread out from Harry's chest in a
wave of prickling, sweat preparing to break out.</p>
<p>...a bird.</p>
<p>A piercing cry split the night, echoing from the rooftops of
Hogwarts.</p>
<p>The approaching creature trailed fire as it flew, shedding
golden flames like sparks from its feathers as the mighty wings
beat and beat again. Even as it swooped up in a great curve to
hover a few paces away from Harry, even as the flames surrounding
its passage diminished, the creature seemed no dimmer, no less
bright; as though some unseen Sun shone upon it and illuminated
it.</p>
<p>Great shining wings red like a sunset, and eyes like
incandescent pearls, blazing with golden fire and
determination.</p>
<p>The phoenix's beak opened, and let out a great caw that Harry
understood as though it had been a spoken word:</p>
<p><em>COME!</em></p>
<p>Not even realizing, the boy stumbled back from the edge of the
rooftop, eyes still locked on the phoenix, his whole body trembling
and tensed, his fists clutching and releasing at his side; stepping
back, stepping away.</p>
<p>The phoenix cawed again, a desperate, pleading, sound. It didn't
come through in words, this time, but it came through in feelings,
an echo of everything that Harry had ever felt about Azkaban and
every temptation to <em>action,</em> to just <em>do</em> something
about it, the desperate need to do something <em>now</em> and not
delay any longer, all spoken in the cry of a bird.</p>
<p><em>Let's go. It's time.</em> The voice that spoke came from
inside Harry, not from the phoenix; from so deep inside it couldn't
be given a separate name like 'Gryffindor'.</p>
<p>All he had to do was step forward and touch the phoenix's
talons, and it would take him where he needed to be, where he kept
thinking he ought to be, down into the central pit of Azkaban.
Harry could see the image in his mind, shining with unbearable
clarity, the image of himself suddenly smiling with joyous release
as he threw all his fears away and <em>chose</em> -</p>
<p>"But I -" Harry whispered, not even aware of what he was saying.
Harry lifted his shaking hands to wipe at his eyes from which tears
had sprung, as the phoenix hovered before him with great
wing-sweeps. "But I - there's other people I also have to save,
other things I have to do -"</p>
<p>The fire-bird let out a piercing scream, and the boy flinched
back as though from a blow. It wasn't a command, it wasn't an
objection, it was the <em>knowledge -</em></p>
<p>The corridors lit by dim orange light.</p>
<p>It felt like a tightening compulsion in Harry's chest, the
desire to just <em>do</em> it and get it over with. He might die,
but if he didn't die he could feel <em>clean</em> again. Have
principles that were more than excuses for inaction. It was
<em>his</em> life. His to spend, if he chose. He could do it any
time he wanted...</p>
<p>...if he wasn't a good person.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The boy stood there on the rooftop, his own eyes locked with two
points of fire. The stars might have had time to shift in their
constellations while he stood there, agonizing over the
decision...</p>
<p>...that wouldn't...</p>
<p>...change.</p>
<p>The boy's eyes flickered once to the stars above; and then he
looked at the phoenix.</p>
<p>"Not yet," the boy said in a voice hardly audible. "Not yet.
There's too much else I have to do. Please come back later, when
I've found others who can cast the True Patronus - in six months,
maybe -"</p>
<p>Without word, without sound, a sphere of fire surrounded the
bird's form, crackling and blazing with white and crimson veins as
though it meant to consume that which lay within; and when the fire
dispersed into grey smoke, no phoenix remained.</p>
<p>There was silence on the top of the Ravenclaw tower. The boy
gradually lowered his hands from his ears, pausing only to wipe at
his wet cheeks.</p>
<p>Slowly, the boy turned -</p>
<p>Then cried out and leapt back and almost fell off the Ravenclaw
tower; though the misstep would hardly have mattered, with that
other wizard standing there.</p>
<p>"And so it was done," Albus Dumbledore said, almost in a
whisper. "So it was done." Fawkes was on his shoulder, staring at
where the other phoenix had been with an indecipherable avian
gaze.</p>
<p>"<em>What are you doing here?</em> "</p>
<p>"Ah?" said the ancient man standing on the roof-platform's
opposite corner. "I felt the presence of a creature Hogwarts did
not know, and came to see, of course." Slowly the old wizard's
shaking hand came up to remove the half-moon glasses, his other
hand wiped at his eyes and forehead with his robe's sleeve. "I
dared - I dared not speak - I knew, I knew this choice above all
choices must be your own -"</p>
<p>A strange apprehension was beginning to fill Harry, welling up
in him like a sick feeling in his stomach.</p>
<p>"That everything depended on this," Albus Dumbledore said, still
in that almost-whisper, "that much I knew. But which choice led
into darkness, that I could not guess. At least the choice was your
own."</p>
<p>"I don't -" Harry said, and then his voice stopped.</p>
<p>A terrible hypothesis, rising in credibility...</p>
<p>"The phoenix comes," said the old wizard. "To those who would
fight, to those would act even at cost of their lives, the phoenix
comes. Phoenixes are not wise, Harry, they know no means to judge
us, save witnessing the choice. I thought it was to my death I
went, when the phoenix took me to fight Grindelwald. I did not know
that Fawkes would sustain me, and heal me, and stay by my side -"
The old wizard's voice quavered, for a moment. "It is not spoken of
- you should realize, Harry, why it is never spoken of - if the one
knew, the phoenix could not judge. But to you, Harry, I may say it
now, for the phoenix comes only once."</p>
<p>The old wizard walked across the top of the Ravenclaw tower to
where a boy stood rooted in dawning horror, in dawning and utter
horror.</p>
<p><em>In my duel with Grindelwald I could not win, only fight him
for long hours until he collapsed in exhaustion; and I would have
died of it afterward, if not for Fawkes -</em></p>
<p>Harry didn't even know he was speaking, until the whisper had
escaped him -</p>
<p>"Then I <em>could</em> have -"</p>
<p>"Could you have?" said the ancient wizard, his voice sounding
far older than his normal tones. "Three times, now, a phoenix has
come for my student. One did send hers away, and the grief of it
broke her, I think. And the last was cousin to your young friend
Lavender Brown, and he -" The old wizard's voice cracked. "He did
not return, did poor John, and he saved none of those he meant to
save. It is said, among the few scholars of phoenix-lore, that not
one in four returns from their ordeal. And even if you did survive
- for the life you must lead, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres - the
choices you must make and the path you must walk - to always hear
the phoenix's cries - who is to say it would not have driven you
mad?" The old wizard raised his sleeve again, drawing it once more
across his face. "I had more joy of Fawkes's companionship, in the
days before I fought Voldemort."</p>
<p>The boy did not seem to be listening, all his eyes were on the
red-gold bird on the ancient wizard's shoulder. "Fawkes?" the boy
said in shaking voice. "Why won't you look at me, Fawkes?"</p>
<p>Fawkes craned his head to peer at the boy curiously, then turned
back and resumed gazing at his master.</p>
<p>"See?" said the old wizard. "He does not reject you. Fawkes may
not be interested in you in quite that way, now; and he knows -"
the wizard smiled wryly, "- that you are not exactly loyal to his
master. But one to whom the phoenix comes at all - cannot be one
whom a phoenix would dislike." The wizard's voice fell to a whisper
again. "There never was a bird seen on Godric Gryffindor's
shoulder. Though it is not written even in his secrets, I think he
must have sent his phoenix away, before he chose the red and gold
for his colors. Perhaps the guilt of it urged him to greater
lengths than he ever would have dared otherwise. Or it might have
taught him humility, and respect for human frailty, and failure..."
The wizard bowed his head. "I truly do not know if your choice was
wise. I truly do not know if it was the right thing, or the wrong
thing. If I knew, Harry, I would have spoken. But I -" Dumbledore's
voice broke, then. "I am nothing but a foolish young boy who has
become a foolish old man, and I have no wisdom."</p>
<p>Harry couldn't breathe, the nausea seeming to fill and overflow
his whole body, stomach locked solid. He was suddenly and terribly
certain that he had failed, in some final sense failed, failed this
very night -</p>
<p>The boy whirled and ran out to the curb of the Ravenclaw
rooftop. "Come back!" His voice cracked, rising to a shriek.
<em>"Come back!</em> "</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Final Aftermath:</em></p>
<p>She came awake with a gasp of horror, she woke with an unvoiced
scream on her lips and no words came forth, she could not
understand what she had seen, <em>she could not understand what she
had seen</em> -</p>
<p>"What time is it?" she whispered.</p>
<p>Her golden jeweled alarm clock whispered back, "Around eleven at
night. Go back to sleep."</p>
<p>Her sheets were soaked in sweat, her nightclothes soaked in
sweat, she took her wand from beside the pillow and cleaned herself
up before she tried to go back to sleep and eventually
succeeded.</p>
<p>Sybill Trelawney went back to sleep.</p>
<p>In the Forbidden Forest, a centaur woken by a nameless
apprehension ceased scanning the night sky, having found only
questions there and no answers; and with a folding of his many
legs, Firenze went back to sleep.</p>
<p>In the distant lands of magical Asia, an ancient witch named Fan
Tong, sleeping the tired days away, told her anxious
great-great-grandson that she was fine, it had only been a
nightmare, and went back to sleep.</p>
<p>In a land where Muggleborns received no letters of any kind, a
girl-child too young to have a name of her own was rocked in the
arms of her annoyed but loving mother until she stopped crying and
went back to sleep.</p>
<p>None of them slept well.</p>

<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 84: Taboo Tradeoffs, Aftermath
2<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>When Hermione Granger woke, she found herself lying in a soft,
comfortable bed of the Hogwarts infirmary, with a square of setting
sunlight falling on her midriff, warm through the thin blanket.
Memory said that there would be a screen-sheet above her, either
drawn around her bed or open, and that the rest of Madam Pomfrey's
domain would lie beyond: the other beds, occupied or unoccupied,
and bright windows set in the curvily-carven stone of Hogwarts.</p>
<p>When Hermione opened her eyes, the first thing she saw was the
face of Professor McGonagall, sitting on the left side of her bed.
Professor Flitwick wasn't there, but that was understandable, he'd
stayed by her side all morning in the detention cell, his silver
raven standing extra guard against the Dementor and his stern
little face always turned outward toward the Aurors. The Head of
Ravenclaw had surely spent way too much time on her, and probably
had to get back to teaching his classes, instead of keeping watch
on a convicted attempted-murderess.</p>
<p>She felt horribly, horribly sick and she didn't think it was
because of any potions. Hermione would've started crying again,
only her throat hurt, her eyes still burned, and her mind just felt
tired. She couldn't have borne to weep again, couldn't find the
strength for tears.</p>
<p>"Where are my parents?" Hermione whispered to the Head of House
Gryffindor. Somehow it seemed like the worst thing in the world to
face them, even worse than everything else; and yet she still
wanted to see them.</p>
<p>The gentle look on Professor McGonagall's face Transfigured into
something sadder. "I'm sorry, Miss Granger. Though it was not
always so, we have found in recent years that it is wiser not to
tell the parents of Muggleborns about any danger their child has
faced. I should advise you also to remain silent, if you wish to
stay at Hogwarts without trouble from them."</p>
<p>"I'm not being expelled?" the girl whispered. "For what I
did?"</p>
<p>"No," said Professor McGonagall. "Miss Granger... surely you
heard... I hope you heard Mr. Potter, when he said that you were
innocent?"</p>
<p>"He was just saying that," she said dully. "To get me free, I
mean."</p>
<p>The older witch shook her head firmly. "No, Miss Granger. Mr.
Potter believes you were Memory-Charmed, that the whole duel never
happened. The Headmaster suspects even Darker magics may have been
involved - that your own hand might have cast the spell, but not
your own will. Even Professor Snape finds the affair completely
unbelievable, though he may not be able to say so publicly. He was
wondering if Muggle drugs might have been used on you."</p>
<p>Hermione's eyes went on staring distantly at the Transfiguration
Professor; she knew that she'd just been told something
significant, but she couldn't find the energy to propagate any
changes through her mind.</p>
<p>"Surely <em>you</em> don't believe it?" said Professor
McGonagall. "Miss Granger, you cannot believe of yourself that you
would turn to murder!"</p>
<p>"But I -" Her excellent memory helpfully replayed it for the
thousandth time, Draco Malfoy telling her with a sneer that she'd
never beat him when he wasn't tired, and then proceeding to prove
just that, dancing like a duelist between the warded trophies while
she frantically scrambled, and dealing the ending blow with a hex
that sent her crashing against the wall and drew blood from her
cheek - and then - then she'd -</p>
<p>"But you remember doing it," said the older witch, who was
watching over her with kindly understanding. "Miss Granger, there
is no need for a twelve-year-old girl to bear such dreadful
memories. Say the word and I shall be happy to lock them away for
you."</p>
<p>It was like a glass of warm water thrown into her face.
"What?"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall took out her wand, a gesture so practiced
and quick that it seemed like pointing a finger. "I can't offer to
rid you of the memories entirely, Miss Granger," the
Transfiguration Professor said with her customary precision. "There
may be important facts buried there. But there is a form of the
Memory Charm which is reversible, and I shall be happy to cast that
on you."</p>
<p>Hermione stared at the wand, feeling the stirrings of hope for
the first time in almost two days.</p>
<p><em>Make it didn't happen...</em> she'd wished that over and
over again, for the hands of time to turn back and erase the
horrible choice that could never, ever be undone. And if erasing
the memory wasn't that, it was still a kind of release...</p>
<p>She looked back at Professor McGonagall's kindly face.</p>
<p>"You <em>really</em> don't think I did it?" Hermione said, her
voice trembling.</p>
<p>"I am <em>quite</em> certain you would never do such a thing of
your own will."</p>
<p>Beneath her blankets, Hermione's hands clutched at the sheets.
"<em>Harry</em> doesn't think I did it?"</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter is of the opinion that your memories are entire
fabrications. I can rather see his point."</p>
<p>Then Hermione's clutching fingers let go of the sheet, and she
slumped back into the bed, from which she'd partially risen.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>She hadn't said anything.</p>
<p>She'd woken up and remembered what had happened last night, and
it had been like - like - she couldn't find words even in her own
thoughts for what it had been like. But she'd known that Draco
Malfoy was already dead, and she hadn't said anything, hadn't gone
to Professor Flitwick and confessed. She'd just dressed herself and
gone down to breakfast and <em>tried to act normal</em> so that
nobody would ever know, and she'd known it was wrong and Wrong and
horribly horribly WRONG but she'd been so, so scared -</p>
<p>Even if Harry Potter was right, even if the duel with Draco
Malfoy was a lie, she'd made <em>that</em> choice all by herself.
She didn't deserve to forget that, or be forgiven for it.</p>
<p>And if she <em>had</em> done the right thing, gone straight to
Professor Flitwick, maybe that would've - helped, somehow, maybe
everyone would've seen then that she regretted it, and Harry
wouldn't have had to give away all his money to save her -</p>
<p>Hermione shut her eyes, squeezed them shut really tight, she
couldn't bear to start crying again. "I'm a horrible person," she
said in a wavering voice. "I'm awful, I'm not heroic at all -"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall's voice was very sharp, like Hermione had
just made some dreadful mistake on her Transfiguration homework.
"Stop being foolish, Miss Granger! <em>Horrible</em> is whoever did
this to you. And as for being heroic - well, Miss Granger, you have
already heard my opinion about young girls trying to involve
themselves in such things before they are even fourteen, so I shall
not lecture you on it again. I shall say only that you have just
had an absolutely dreadful experience, which you survived as well
as any witch in your year possibly could. Today you are allowed to
cry as much as you like. Tomorrow you are going back to class."</p>
<p>That was when Hermione knew that Professor McGonagall couldn't
help her. She needed someone to scold her, she couldn't be absolved
if she couldn't be blamed, and Professor McGonagall would never do
that for her, would never ask so much of a little Ravenclaw
girl.</p>
<p>It was something Harry Potter wouldn't help her with either.</p>
<p>Hermione turned over in the infirmary bed, huddling into
herself, away from Professor McGonagall. "Please," she whispered.
"I want to talk - to the Headmaster -"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"Hermione."</p>
<p>When Hermione Granger opened her eyes a second time, she saw the
care-lined face of Albus Dumbledore leaning over her bedside,
looking almost as though <em>he'd</em> been crying, though that was
impossible; and Hermione felt another stabbing pang of guilt for
having bothered him so.</p>
<p>"Minerva said you wished to speak with me," the old wizard
said.</p>
<p>"I -" Suddenly Hermione didn't know at all what to say. Her
throat locked up, and all she could do was stammer, "I - I'm -"</p>
<p>Somehow her tone must have communicated the other word, the one
she couldn't even say anymore.</p>
<p>"<em>Sorry?</em> " said Dumbledore. "Why, for what should you be
sorry?"</p>
<p>She had to force the words out of her throat. "You were telling
Harry - that he shouldn't pay - so <em>I</em> shouldn't - have done
what Professor McGonagall said, I shouldn't have touched his wand
-"</p>
<p>"My dear," said Dumbledore, "had you not pledged yourself to the
House of Potter, Harry would have attacked Azkaban singlehandedly,
and quite possibly won. That boy may choose his words carefully,
but I have never yet known him to lie; and in the Boy-Who-Lived
there is power that the Dark Lord never knew. He would indeed have
tried to break Azkaban, even at cost of his life." The old wizard's
voice grew gentler, and kinder. "No, Hermione, you have nothing at
all for which to blame yourself."</p>
<p>"I could have <em>made</em> him not do it."</p>
<p>In Dumbledore's eyes a small twinkle appeared before it was lost
to weariness. "Really, Miss Granger? Perhaps you should be
Headmistress in my place, for I myself have no such power over
stubborn children."</p>
<p>"Harry promised -" Her voice stopped. The awful truth was very
hard to speak. "Harry Potter promised me - that he would never help
me - if I told him not to."</p>
<p>There was a pause. The distant noises of the infirmary that had
accompanied Professor McGonagall had ceased, Hermione realized,
when Dumbledore had awoken her. From where she lay in bed she could
see only the ceiling, and the top of one wall's windows, but
nothing in her range of vision moved, and if there were sounds, she
could not hear them.</p>
<p>"Ah," said Dumbledore. The old wizard sighed heavily. "I suppose
it <em>is</em> possible that the boy would have kept his
promise."</p>
<p>"I should - I should've -"</p>
<p>"Gone to Azkaban of your own will?" Dumbledore said. "Miss
Granger, that is more than I would ever ask anyone to take upon
themselves."</p>
<p>"But -" Hermione swallowed. She couldn't help but notice the
loophole, anyone who wanted to get through the portrait-door to the
Ravenclaw dorm quickly learned to pay attention to exact wordings.
"But it's not more than you'd take on <em>yourself</em>."</p>
<p>"Hermione -" the old wizard began.</p>
<p>"Why?" said Hermione's voice, it seemed to be running on without
her mind, now. "Why couldn't I be braver? I was going to run in
front of the Dementor - for Harry - before, I mean, in January - so
why - why - why couldn't I -" Why had the thought of being sent to
Azkaban just completely <em>unglued</em> her, why had she forgotten
everything about being Good -</p>
<p>"My dear girl," Dumbledore said. The blue eyes behind the
half-moon glasses showed a complete understanding of her guilt. "I
would have done no better myself, in my first year in Hogwarts. As
you would be kind to others, be kinder to yourself as well."</p>
<p>"So I <em>did</em> do the wrong thing." Somehow she needed to
say that, to be told that, even though she already knew.</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>"Listen, young Ravenclaw," the old wizard said, "hear me well,
for I shall speak to you a truth. Most ill-doers do not think of
themselves as evil; indeed, most conceive themselves the heroes of
the stories they tell. I once thought that the greatest evil in
this world was done in the name of the greater good. I was wrong.
Terribly wrong. There is evil in this world which knows itself for
evil, and hates the good with all its strength. All fair things
does it desire to destroy."</p>
<p>Hermione shivered in her bed, somehow it seemed very real, when
Dumbledore said it.</p>
<p>The old wizard continued speaking. "You are one of the fair
things of this world, Hermione Granger, and so that evil hates you
as well. If you had stayed firm through even this trial, it would
have struck you harder and yet harder, until you shattered. Do not
think that heroes cannot be broken! We are only more difficult to
break, Hermione." The old wizard's eyes had grown sterner than she
had ever seen. "When you have been exhausted for many hours, when
pain and death is not a passing fear but a certainty, then it is
harder to be a hero. If I must speak the truth - then today, yes, I
would not waver in the face of Azkaban. But when I was a first-year
in Hogwarts - I would have fled from the Dementor that you
confronted, for my father had died in Azkaban, and I feared them.
Know this! The evil that struck at you could have broken anyone,
even myself. Only Harry Potter has it within him to face that
horror, when he has come fully into his power."</p>
<p>Hermione's neck couldn't stare at the old wizard any longer; she
let her head fall back, back to the pillow, where she stared up at
the ceiling, absorbing what she could.</p>
<p>"Why?" Her voice trembled again. "Why would anyone be that evil?
I don't understand."</p>
<p>"I, too, have wondered," said Dumbledore's voice, a deep sadness
in it. "For thrice ten years I wondered, and I still do not
understand. You and I will never understand, Hermione Granger. But
at least I know now what true evil would say for itself, if we
could speak to it and ask why it was evil. It would say, <em>Why
not?</em> "</p>
<p>A brief flare of indignation inside her. "There's got to be a
<em>million</em> reasons why not!"</p>
<p>"Indeed," said Dumbledore's voice. "A million reasons and more.
We will always know those reasons, you and I. If you insist on
putting it that way - then yes, Hermione, this day's trial broke
you. But what happens <em>after</em> you break - that, too, is part
of being a hero. Which you are, Hermione Granger, and will always
be."</p>
<p>She raised her head again, staring at him.</p>
<p>The old wizard got up from beside her bed. His silver beard
dipped down, as Dumbledore bowed to her gravely, and left.</p>
<p>She went on looking at where the old wizard had gone.</p>
<p>It should have meant something to her, should have touched her.
Should have made her felt better inside, that Dumbledore, who had
seemed so reluctant before, had now acknowledged her as a hero.</p>
<p>She felt nothing.</p>
<p>Hermione let her head fall back to the bed, as Madam Pomfrey
came and made her drink something that seared her lips like the
afterburn of spicy food, and smelled even hotter, and didn't taste
like anything at all. It meant nothing to her. She went on staring
up at the distant stone tiles of the ceiling.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Minerva was waiting, doing her best not to hover, beside the
double doors to the Hogwarts infirmary, she'd always thought of
those doors as "the ominous gates" as a child in Hogwarts, and
couldn't help but remember that now. Too much bad news had been
spoken here -</p>
<p>Albus stepped out. The old wizard did not pause on the way out
of the infirmary, only kept walking toward Professor Flitwick's
office; and Minerva followed him.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall cleared her throat. "Is it done,
Albus?"</p>
<p>The old wizard nodded in affirmation. "If any hostile magic is
cast on her, or any spirit touches her, I shall know, and
come."</p>
<p>"I spoke to Mr. Potter after Transfiguration class," said
Professor McGonagall. "He was of the opinion that Miss Granger
should go to Beauxbatons, rather than Hogwarts, from now on."</p>
<p>The old wizard shook his head. "No. If Voldemort truly desires
to strike at Miss Granger - he is tenacious beyond measure. His
servants are returning to him, he could not have retrieved
Bellatrix alone. Azkaban itself is not safe from his malice, and as
for Beauxbatons - no, Minerva. I do not think Voldemort can essay
such possessions often, or against stronger targets, or this year
would have gone quite differently. And Harry Potter is here, whom
Voldemort must fear whether he admits it or no. Now that I have
warded her, Miss Granger will be safer within Hogwarts than
without."</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter seemed to doubt that," Minerva said. She couldn't
quite keep the edge from her voice; there was a part of her that
agreed rather strongly. "He seemed to feel that common sense said
Miss Granger should continue her education anywhere but
Hogwarts."</p>
<p>The old wizard sighed. "I fear the boy has spent too much time
among the Muggles. Always they reach for safety; always they
imagine that safety can be reached. If Miss Granger is not safe
within the center of our fortress, she shall be no safer for
leaving it."</p>
<p>"Not everyone seems to think so," said Professor McGonagall. It
had been almost the first letter she'd seen when she'd taken a
quick look at her desk; an envelope of the finest sheepskin, sealed
in greenish-silver wax, pressed into the image of a snake that rose
and hissed at her. "I have received Lord Malfoy's owl withdrawing
his son from Hogwarts."</p>
<p>The old wizard nodded, but did not break stride. "Does Harry
know?"</p>
<p>"Yes." Her voice faltered, for a moment, remembering Harry's
expression. "After class, Mr. Potter complimented Lord Malfoy's
excellent good sense, and said that he would be writing Madam
Longbottom advising her to do the same with her grandson, in case
he was the next target. In the event that Mr. Longbottom's guardian
was so negligent as to keep him in Hogwarts, Mr. Potter wanted him
to have a Time-Turner, an invisibility cloak, a broomstick, and a
pouch in which to carry them; also a toe-ring with an emergency
portkey to a safe location, in case someone kidnaps Mr. Longbottom
and takes him outside Hogwarts's wards. I told Mr. Potter that I
did not think the Ministry would consent to such use of our
Time-Turners, and he said that we should not ask. I expect he will
want Miss Granger to receive the same, if she stays. And for
himself Mr. Potter wants a three-person broomstick to carry in his
pouch." She wasn't awed by the list of precautions. Impressed with
the cleverness, but not awed; she was a Transfiguration Mistress,
after all. But it still sent shivers of disquiet through her, that
Harry Potter now thought Hogwarts as dangerous as spell
research.</p>
<p>"The Department of Mysteries is not lightly defied," said Albus.
"But for the rest -" The old wizard seemed to slump in on himself
slightly. "We may as well give the boy what he wishes. And I will
ward Neville also, and write Augusta to say that he should stay
here over holiday."</p>
<p>"And finally," she said, "Mr. Potter says - this is a direct
quote, Albus - whatever kind of Dark Wizard attractant the
Headmaster is keeping here, he needs to get it out of this school,
<em>now</em>." She couldn't stop the edge in her own voice, that
time.</p>
<p>"I asked as much of Flamel," Albus said, the pain clear in his
voice. "But Master Flamel has said - that even <em>he</em> can no
longer keep safe the Stone - that he believes Voldemort has means
of finding it wherever it is hidden - and that he does not consent
for it to be guarded anywhere but Hogwarts. Minerva, I am sorry,
but it must be done - <em>must!</em> "</p>
<p>"Very well," said Professor McGonagall. "But for myself, I think
that Mr. Potter is right on every single count."</p>
<p>The old wizard glanced at her, and his voice caught as he said,
"Minerva, you have known me long, and as well as any soul still
living - tell me, have I lost myself to darkness already?"</p>
<p>"What?" said Professor McGonagall in genuine surprise. Then,
"Oh, Albus, no!"</p>
<p>The old wizard's lips pressed together tightly before he spoke.
"For the greater good. I have sacrificed so many, for the greater
good. Today I almost condemned Hermione Granger to Azkaban for the
greater good. And I find myself - today, I found myself - beginning
to resent the innocence that is no longer mine -" The old wizard's
voice halted. "Evil done in the name of good. Evil done in the name
of evil. Which <em>is</em> worse?"</p>
<p>"You are being silly, Albus."</p>
<p>The old wizard glanced at her again, before turning his eyes
back to their way. "Tell me, Minerva - did you pause to weigh the
consequences, before you told Miss Granger how to bind herself to
the Potter family?"</p>
<p>She took an involuntary breath as she understood what she had
done -</p>
<p>"So you did not." Albus's eyes were saddened. "No, Minerva, you
must not apologize. It is well. For what you have seen of me this
day - if your first loyalty is now to Harry Potter, and not to me,
then that is right and proper." She opened her lips to protest, but
Albus went on before she could say a word. "Indeed - indeed - that
will be necessary and more than necessary, if the Dark Lord that
Harry must defeat to come into his power is not Voldemort after all
-"</p>
<p>"Not <em>this</em> again!" Minerva said. "Albus, it was
You-Know-Who, not you, who marked Harry as his equal. There is no
<em>possible</em> way that the prophecy could be talking about
you!"</p>
<p>The old wizard nodded, but his eyes still seemed distant, fixed
only on the road ahead.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The holding cell, well to the center of Magical Law Enforcement,
was luxuriously appointed; more a remark on what adult wizards took
for granted, than any special feeling toward prisoners. There was a
self-reclining, self-rocking chair with plush, richly textured,
self-warming cushions. There was a bookcase containing random books
rescued from a bargain bin, and a full shelf of ancient magazines,
including one from 1883. As for toiletries, well, it wasn't exactly
luxurious, but there was a spell on the room which put all that
business on hold; you weren't to go anywhere that the watching
Auror couldn't see you. But aside from that, it was quite a
pleasant little cell. The Defense Professor of Hogwarts was being
detained, not arrested, not even intimidated. There was no evidence
to indict him... except that a terrible and unusual crime had been
committed at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and
going by previous occasions the odds were five to one that the
current Defense Professor was tangled up in it <em>somehow</em>. To
this must be added the fact that nobody in the D.M.L.E. even knew
who the Defense Professor <em>was</em>, and that the man had
literally <em>sneezed</em> at all attempts to uncover his true
identity. Why, no, they <em>hadn't</em> released 'Quirinus
Quirrell' back to Hogwarts just yet.</p>
<p>Let us repeat this for emphasis:</p>
<p>The Defense Professor.</p>
<p>Was being detained.</p>
<p>In a cell.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor was staring at the watching Auror and
humming.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor has not spoken a single word since he
arrived in this particular cell. He has <em>only</em> been
humming.</p>
<p>The humming started as a simple children's lullaby, the one that
in Muggle Britain begins, <em>Lullaby, and goodnight...</em></p>
<p>This tune was hummed, without variation, over and over, for
seven minutes, to establish the underlying pattern.</p>
<p>Then began the elaborations upon the theme. Phrases hummed too
slow, with long pauses in between, so that the listener's mind
helplessly waits and waits for the next note, the next phrase. And
then, when that next phrase comes, it is so out of key, so
unbelievably awfully out of key, not just out of key for the
previous phrases but sung at a pitch which does not correspond to
<em>any</em> key, that you would have to believe this person had
spent hours deliberately practicing their humming just to acquire
such perfect anti-pitch.</p>
<p>It bears the same semblance to music as the awful dead voice of
a Dementor bears to human speech.</p>
<p>And this horrible, horrible humming is <em>impossible</em> to
ignore. It is similar to a known lullaby, but it departs from that
pattern unpredictably. It sets up expectations and then violates
them, never in any constant pattern that would permit the humming
to fade into the background. The listener's brain cannot prevent
itself from expecting the anti-musical phrases to complete, nor
prevent itself from noticing the surprises.</p>
<p>The only possible explanation for how this mode of humming came
to exist is that it was deliberately designed by some unspeakably
cruel genius who woke up one day, feeling bored with ordinary
torture, who decided to handicap himself and find out whether he
could break someone's sanity <em>just by humming at them</em>.</p>
<p>The Auror has been listening to this unimaginably dreadful
humming for four hours, while being stared at by a huge, cold,
lethal presence that feels equally horrible whether he looks at it
directly or lets it hover at the corner of his vision -</p>
<p>The humming stopped.</p>
<p>There was a long wait. Time enough for false hope to rise, and
be squashed down by the memory of previous disappointments. And
then, as the interval lengthened, and lengthened, that hope rose
again unstoppably -</p>
<p>The humming began once more.</p>
<p>The Auror cracked.</p>
<p>From his belt, the Auror took a mirror, tapped it once, and then
said, "This is Junior Auror Arjun Altunay, I'm calling in code
RJ-L20 on cell three."</p>
<p>"Code RJ-L20?" the mirror said in surprised tones. There was a
sound of pages being flipped, then, "You want to be relieved
because a prisoner is attempting psychological warfare and
succeeding?"</p>
<p>(Amelia Bones really is quite intelligent.)</p>
<p>"What'd the prisoner say to you?" said the mirror.</p>
<p>(This question is <em>not</em> part of procedure RJ-L20, but
unfortunately Amelia Bones has failed to include an explicit
instruction that the commanding officer should not ask.)</p>
<p>"He's -" said the Auror, and glanced back at the cell. The
Defense Professor was now leaning in back in his chair, looking
quite relaxed. "He was <em>staring</em> at me! And
<em>humming!</em> "</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>The mirror spoke again. "And you're calling in an RJ-L20 over
that? You're sure you're not just trying to get out of watching
him?"</p>
<p>(Amelia Bones is surrounded by idiots.)</p>
<p>"You don't understand!" yelled Auror Altunay. "It's really awful
humming!"</p>
<p>The mirror transmitted a sound of muffled laughter in the
background, sounding like it was coming from more than one person.
Then speech again. "Mr. Altunay, if you don't want to be busted to
Junior Auror Second Class, I suggest you buckle down and get back
to work -"</p>
<p>"Strike that," a crisp voice said, sounding slightly remote due
to its distance from the mirror.</p>
<p>(Which is why Amelia Bones often sits in on a coordination
center of the D.M.L.E. while doing her Ministry-required
paperwork.)</p>
<p>"Auror Altunay," said the crisp voice, seeming to approach
closer to the mirror, "you will be relieved shortly. Auror Ben
Gutierrez, the procedure for RJ-L20 does <em>not</em> say that you
ask why. It says that you relieve the Auror who calls it in.
<em>If</em> I find that Aurors seem to be abusing it, <em>I</em>
will modify the procedure to prevent its abuse -" The mirror cut
off abruptly.</p>
<p>The Auror turned back to look triumphantly at where the current
Defense Professor of Hogwarts was leaning back in his cushioned
chair.</p>
<p>That man then spoke the first words that had left his lips since
he entered the cell.</p>
<p>"Goodbye, Mr. Altunay," said the Defense Professor.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, the door to the detention cell opened, and
in walked a grey-haired woman, dressed in the crimson-tinged robes
of an Auror without any sign of rank or other ornamentation,
carrying a black leather folder under her left arm. "You're
relieved," the old woman said abruptly.</p>
<p>There was a brief delay while Auror Altunay tried to explain
what had been happening. This was cut short by a nod and a stark,
simple finger pointing out the door.</p>
<p>"Good evening, Madam Director," said the Defense Professor.</p>
<p>Amelia Bones did not acknowledge this statement, but sat down
abruptly in the vacated chair. The old witch opened the black
folder and her gaze moved down to the parchments therein. "Possible
hints to the identity of the current Hogwarts Defense Professor, as
compiled by Auror Robards." The title parchment was turned, flipped
aside. "The Defense Professor said that he was Sorted into
Slytherin. Claimed that his family was killed by Voldemort. Said he
had studied at a martial arts center in Muggle Asia which was
destroyed by Voldemort. A request filed with the Department of
International Magical Cooperation identifies this incident as the
Oni Affair of 1969." Another parchment was flipped aside. "It also
seems this Defense Professor gave a most stirring speech to his
students, just before last Yule, castigating the previous
generation for their disunity against the Death Eaters." The old
witch looked up from the leather folder. "Madam Longbottom was
rather taken with it, and insisted that I read the entire thing.
The argument struck me as familiar, though I could not place it at
the time. But then, of course, I had thought you dead."</p>
<p>The chief law enforcement officer of Magical Britain was now
gazing sharply at the current Defense Professor of Hogwarts, across
the pane of spell-reinforced glass separating them. The man in the
cell returned the gaze equably, without apparent alarm.</p>
<p>"I shall not name any names," said the old witch. "But I shall
tell a story, and see if it sounds familiar." Amelia Bones looked
back down, turning to the next parchment. "Born 1927, entered
Hogwarts in 1938, sorted into Slytherin, graduated 1945. Went on a
graduation tour abroad and disappeared while visiting Albania.
Presumed dead until 1970, when he returned to magical Britain just
as suddenly, without any explanation for the missing twenty-five
years. He remained estranged from his family and friends, living in
isolation. In 1971, while visiting Diagon Alley, he fended off an
attempt by Bellatrix Black to kidnap the daughter of the Minister
of Magic, and used the Killing Curse to slay two of the three Death
Eaters accompanying her. Beyond this all Britain knows the story;
need I continue it?" The old witch looked up from her folder again.
"Very well. There was a trial in the Wizengamot, during which this
young man was exonerated for his use of the Killing Curse, not
least due to the efforts of his grandmother, the Lady of his House.
He was reconciled with his family, and they held a House gathering
to welcome his return. The guest of honor arrived at that gathering
to find his entire family slain by Death Eaters, even to the house
elves; and that he himself, of cadet line, was now the last
remaining scion of a Most Ancient House."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor had not reacted at all to any of this,
except that his eyes had half-closed, as though in weariness.</p>
<p>"The young man took up his family's seat in the Wizengamot,
becoming among the most steadfast voices against You-Know-Who.
Several times he led forces against the Death Eaters, fighting with
skillful tactics and extraordinary power. People began to speak of
him as the next Dumbledore, it was thought that he might become
Minister of Magic after the Dark Lord fell. On the third of July,
1973, he failed to appear at a key Wizengamot vote, and was never
heard from again. We assumed You-Know-Who had killed him. It was a
grave blow to all of us, and matters went much the worse from that
day on." The old witch's gaze was questioning. "I mourned you
myself. What happened?"</p>
<p>The Defense Professor's shoulders moved lightly, a small shrug.
"You make many assumptions," the Defense Professor said softly.
"For myself, I would believe that man died years ago. But if that
man is nonetheless alive - then it is clear he does not wish the
fact announced, and has reasons enough for silence. That man was
once of some help to you, it seems." The Defense Professor's lips
curved in a cynical smile. "But I am no longer surprised when
gratitude is fleeting. Is there yet more that you would demand from
him?"</p>
<p>The old witch leaned back in her Auror's monitoring-chair,
looking rather startled, maybe even hurt. "No -" she said after a
moment. Her fingers tapped the leather folder; <em>nervously,</em>
you might have thought, if you had believed that Amelia Bones could
ever be nervous. "But your <em>House</em> - there are not many
Ancient Houses remaining -"</p>
<p>"It shall matter little to this country whether eight Ancient
Houses remain, or seven."</p>
<p>The old witch sighed. "What does Dumbledore think of this?"</p>
<p>The man in the detention cell shook his head. "He does not know
who I am, and promised not to inquire."</p>
<p>The old witch's eyebrows rose. "How did he identify you to the
Hogwarts wards, then?"</p>
<p>A slight smile. "The Headmaster drew a circle, and told Hogwarts
that he who stood within was the Defense Professor. Speaking of
which -" The tone went lower, flatter. "I am missing my classes,
Director Bones."</p>
<p>"You seem to - <em>rest</em>, sometimes, in a peculiar manner.
This has also been reported. And you seem to be <em>resting</em>
more and more frequently, as time goes on." The old witch's fingers
tapped the leather folder again. "I cannot recall reading of such a
symptom, but when one hears of such a thing, one imagines... Dark
Wizards fought, and terrible curses received..."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor remained expressionless.</p>
<p>"Do you require a healer's help?" said Amelia Bones. Her own
mask had slipped, clearly showing the pain in her eyes. "Is there
anything at all that can be done for you?"</p>
<p>"I agreed to teach Defense at Hogwarts," the man in the cell
said flatly. "Draw your own conclusions, Madam. And I am missing my
classes, of which there are not many left. I would return to
Hogwarts, now."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>When Hermione woke the third time (though it felt like she'd
only closed her eyes for a moment) the Sun was even lower in the
sky, almost fully set. She felt a little more alive and, strangely,
even more exhausted. This time it was Professor Flitwick who was
standing next to her bed and shaking her shoulder, a tray of
steaming food floating next to him. For some reason she'd thought
Harry Potter ought to be leaning over her bedside, but he wasn't
there. Had she dreamed that? She couldn't remember dreaming.</p>
<p>It developed (according to Professor Flitwick) that Hermione had
missed dinner in the Great Hall, and was being woken to eat. And
then she could go back to the Ravenclaw dorm, and her own bed, to
sleep the rest of the night.</p>
<p>She ate in silence. There was a part of her that wanted to ask
Professor Flitwick whether <em>he</em> thought she'd been
Memory-Charmed or she'd tried to kill Draco Malfoy of her own will
-</p>
<p><em>- like she remembered doing -</em></p>
<p>- but most of her was afraid to find out. <em>Afraid to find
out</em> was a warning sign, according to Harry Potter and his
books; but her mind felt tired, <em>bruised,</em> and she couldn't
muster the strength to override it.</p>
<p>When she and Professor Flitwick left the infirmary they found
Harry Potter sitting cross-legged outside the door, quietly reading
a psychology textbook.</p>
<p>"I'll take her from here," said the Boy-Who-Lived. "Professor
McGonagall said it would be all right."</p>
<p>Professor Flitwick seemed to accept this, and departed after a
stern look at both of them. She couldn't imagine what the stern
look was supposed to say, unless it was <em>don't try to kill any
more students.</em></p>
<p>The footsteps of Professor Flitwick faded, and the two of them
stood alone outside the doors of the infirmary.</p>
<p>She looked at the green eyes of the Boy-Who-Lived, the mess of
hair that didn't quite obscure the scar on his forehead; she looked
upon the face of the boy who'd given all his money to save her
without a second thought. There were feelings inside her - guilt,
shame, embarrassment, other things as well - but no words. There
was nothing she knew how to say.</p>
<p>"So," Harry said abruptly, "I did a quick skim through my
psychology books to see what they said about post-traumatic stress
disorder. The old books said you should talk about the experience
immediately afterward with a counselor. The newer research says
that when they actually ran experiments, it turned out that talking
about it immediately afterward made it worse. Apparently what you
really ought to do is run with your mind's natural impulse to
repress the memories and just not think about it for a while."</p>
<p>It was so <em>normal</em> for the way she and Harry usually
talked that she felt a sudden burning in her throat.</p>
<p><em>We don't have to talk about it.</em> That was what Harry had
just said, more or less. It felt like cheating, maybe even like a
lie. Nothing <em>was</em> normal. Everything wrong was still
horribly wrong, everything left unsaid still needed to be
said...</p>
<p>"Okay," said Hermione, because there wasn't anything else to
say, anything else at all.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry I wasn't waiting when you woke up," Harry said, as
they started to walk. "Madam Pomfrey wouldn't let me in, so I just
stayed out here." He gave a small, sad-looking shrug. "I suppose I
should be out there trying to run damage control on public
relations, but... honestly I've never been good at that, I just end
up speaking sharply at people."</p>
<p>"How bad is it?" She thought her voice should have come out in a
whisper, a croak, but it didn't.</p>
<p>"Well -" Harry said with obvious hesitation. "The thing you've
got to understand, Hermione, is that you had a lot of defenders at
breakfast-time today, but everyone on your side was... <em>making
stuff up</em>. Draco tried to kill you first, things like that. It
was Granger versus Malfoy, that's how people saw it, like a seesaw
where pushing his side down meant pushing your side up. I told them
you were probably <em>both</em> innocent, that you'd both been
Memory-Charmed. They didn't listen, both sides treated me like a
traitor trying to play the middle. And then people heard that Draco
had testified under Veritaserum that he'd been trying to help you
before the battle - stop making that expression, Hermione, you
didn't actually do anything to him. Anyway, all people understood
was that the pro-Malfoy faction had been right and the pro-Granger
faction had been wrong." Harry gave a small sigh. "I <em>told</em>
them that when the truth came out later they'd be
embarrassed..."</p>
<p>"How bad is it?" she said again. This time her voice did come
out weaker.</p>
<p>"Remember Asch's conformity experiment?" Harry said, turning his
head to give her a serious look.</p>
<p>Her mind was <em>slow to remember</em> for a few seconds, which
frightened her, but then the reference came back. In 1951, Solomon
Asch had taken some experimental subjects, and each one had been
put among a row of other people who looked like them, seeming like
other experimental subjects, but actually confederates of the
experimenter. They'd shown a reference line on a screen, labeled X,
next to three other lines, labeled A, B, and C. The experimenter
had asked which line X was the same length as. The correct answer
had obviously been C. The other 'subjects', the confederates, had
one after another said that X was the same length as B. The real
subject had been put second-to-last in the order, so as not to
arouse suspicion by being last. The test had been to see whether
the real subject would 'conform' to the standard wrong answer of B,
or voice the obviously correct answer of C.</p>
<p>75% of the subjects had 'conformed' at least once. A third of
the subjects had conformed more than half the time. Some had
reported afterward actually believing that X was the same length as
B. And that had been in a case where the subjects hadn't known any
of the confederates. If you put people around others who belonged
to the same group as them, like someone in a wheelchair next to
other people in a wheelchair, the conformity effect got even
stronger...</p>
<p>Hermione had a sickening feeling where this was going. "I
remember," she whispered.</p>
<p>"I gave the Chaos Legion anti-conformity training, you know. I
had each Legionnaire stand in the middle and say 'Twice two is
four!' or 'Grass is green!' while everyone else in the Chaos Legion
called them idiots or sneered at them - Allen Flint did really good
sneers - or even just gave them blank looks and then walked away.
The thing you've got to remember is, <em>only</em> the Chaos Legion
has ever practiced anything like that. Nobody else in Hogwarts even
knows what conformity <em>is.</em>"</p>
<p>"Harry!" Her voice was wobbling. "How bad <em>is</em> it?"</p>
<p>Harry gave another sad-looking shrug. "Everyone in the second
year and above, since they don't know you. Everyone in Dragon Army.
All of Slytherin, of course. And, well, most of the rest of magical
Britain too, I think. Remember, Lucius Malfoy controls the
<em>Daily Prophet</em>."</p>
<p>"Everyone?" she whispered. Her limbs had started to feel cold,
like she'd just gotten out of an unheated swimming pool.</p>
<p>"What people really believe doesn't feel like a <em>belief</em>,
it feels like the way the world <em>is.</em> You and I are standing
in a private little bubble of the universe where Hermione Granger
got Memory-Charmed. Everyone else is living in the world where
Hermione Granger tried to murder Draco Malfoy. If Ernie Macmillian
-"</p>
<p>Her breath caught in her throat. <em>Captain Macmillian
-</em></p>
<p>"- thinks he's ethically prohibited from being your friend now,
well, he's trying to do the right thing as he understands it, in
the world he thinks he lives in." Harry's eyes were very serious.
"Hermione, you've told me a lot of times that I look down too much
on other people. But if I expected too much of them - if I expected
people to get things <em>right</em> - I really would hate them,
then. Idealism aside, Hogwarts students don't <em>actually</em>
know enough cognitive science to take responsibility for how their
own minds work. It's not their fault they're crazy." Harry's voice
was strangely gentle, almost like an adult's. "I know it's going to
be harder on you than it would be on me. But remember, eventually
the real culprit gets nailed. The truth comes out, everyone who was
confidently wrong gets embarrassed."</p>
<p>"And if the real culprit doesn't get caught?" she said in a
trembling voice.</p>
<p><em>...or if it turns out to be me after all?</em></p>
<p>"Then you can leave Hogwarts and go to the Salem Witches'
Institute in America."</p>
<p>"<em>Leave Hogwarts?</em> " She'd never even thought of that
possibility except as an ultimate punishment.</p>
<p>"I... Hermione, I think you might want to do that anyway.
Hogwarts isn't a castle, it's insanity with walls. You
<em>have</em> got other options."</p>
<p>"I'll..." she stammered. "I'll have... to think about it..."</p>
<p>Harry nodded. " At least nobody's going to try hexing you, not
after what the Headmaster said at dinner tonight. Oh, and Ron
Weasley came up to me, looking very serious, and told me that if I
saw you first, I should tell you that he's sorry for having thought
badly of you, and he'll never speak ill of you again."</p>
<p>"<em>Ron</em> believes I'm innocent?" said Hermione.</p>
<p>"Well... he doesn't think you're <em>innocent,</em> per
se..."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The whole Ravenclaw dorm went silent as the two of them walked
in.</p>
<p>Staring at them.</p>
<p>Staring at her.</p>
<p>(She'd had nightmares like this.)</p>
<p>And then, one by one, people looked away from her.</p>
<p>Penelope Clearwater, the 5th-year prefect in charge of
first-years, looked away slowly and deliberately, turning her head
to face in another direction.</p>
<p>Su Li and Lisa Turpin and Michael Corner, all sitting at a table
together, all of whom she'd helped with their homework at one time
or another, all looked away, their faces suddenly nervous, the
moment she tried to catch their eyes.</p>
<p>A third-year witch named Latisha Randle, whom S.P.H.E.W. had
twice saved from Slytherin bullies, quickly bent back over her desk
and started doing homework again.</p>
<p>Mandy Brocklehurst looked away from her.</p>
<p>If Hermione didn't burst into tears, then, it was only because
she'd expected it, had played it out in her mind over and over
again. At least people weren't screaming at her or shoving her or
hexing her. They were just looking away -</p>
<p>Hermione walked very straight up to the staircaise that led
toward the first-year girl's dorms. (She didn't see Padma Patil or
Anthony Goldstein looking at her, those two lone heads turning to
track her as she left.) From behind her, she heard Harry Potter
saying in a very calm tone, "Now eventually the truth's going to
come out, you all. So if you're all that confident she's guilty,
can I ask you all to sign this paper right here, saying that if she
later turns out to be innocent, she gets to say 'I told you so' and
then hold it over you for the rest of your lives? Step on up, one
and all, don't be cowards, if you really believe you shouldn't be
afraid to bet -"</p>
<p>She was halfway up the stairs when she realized that there would
be other girls inside her dorm room, too.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The stars hadn't quite come out yet, only one or two of the
brightest ones visible through the reddish-purple haze of the
horizon, though the sun had fully sunk.</p>
<p>Hermione's hands dug into the harsh stone of the parapet
guarding the small balcony, where she'd ducked out of the stairwell
after realizing that -</p>
<p>- <em>she couldn't just go back to bed</em> -</p>
<p>- the words echoed in her mind like 'You can't go home again'
ought to sound.</p>
<p>She stared out at the empty grounds, the fading sunset, the
sprouting grass so far below.</p>
<p>Tired, she was tired, she couldn't think now, she needed to
sleep. Professor Flitwick had told her that she needed to sleep,
and there'd been yet another potion with her dinner. Maybe that was
how wizarding society treated horrible traumas to innocent young
girls, just made them sleep a lot afterward.</p>
<p>She should go to her room and sleep, but she was afraid to go
someplace where other people were. Afraid of how they might look at
her, or look away.</p>
<p>Fragments of thought chased themselves around a mind too
exhausted to finish or connect them, as the night fully set in.</p>
<p><em>Why -</em></p>
<p><em>Why did all this happen -</em></p>
<p><em>Everything was fine a week ago -</em></p>
<p><em>Why -</em></p>
<p>From behind her came the creaky sound of an opening door.</p>
<p>She turned her head and looked.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was leaning against the doorway she'd walked
through, silhouetted like a cardboard cutout by the light of the
Hogwarts torches lit behind him, in the open door. She couldn't see
his expression, though the doorway behind him was bright; his eyes,
his face, everything she could see from here lay within night's
shadow.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor of Hogwarts, number one on the list of
people who might've done this. She hadn't even realized she
<em>had</em> a suspect list until that moment.</p>
<p>The man stood within that doorway, saying nothing; and she
couldn't see his eyes. What was he even <em>doing</em> there in the
first place -</p>
<p>"Are you here to kill me?" said Hermione Granger.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's head tilted at that.</p>
<p>Then the Defense Professor started toward her, the dark
silhouette raising one hand slowly and deliberately, as though to
push her off the Ravenclaw tower -</p>
<p>"<em>Stupefy!</em> "</p>
<p>The burst of adrenaline overrode everything, she drew her wand
without thinking, her lips formed the word of their own accord, the
stunbolt leapt out of her wand and -</p>
<p>- <em>slowed to a stop</em> in front of Professor Quirrell's
raised hand, rippling in midair like it was still trying to fly and
making a slight hissing sound.</p>
<p>The red glow illuminated Professor Quirrell's face for the first
time, showing a strange fond smile.</p>
<p>"Better," said Professor Quirrell. "Miss Granger, you are still
a student in my Defense class. As such, if you consider me a
threat, I do not expect you to just look at me sadly and ask if I
am there to kill you. Minus two Quirrell points."</p>
<p>She was entirely unable to form words.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor flicked his forefinger casually at the
suspended stunbolt, sending the hex shooting back over her head,
far into the night, so that they stood again in darkness. Then
Professor Quirrell walked out of the doorway, which swung shut
behind him; and a soft white light sprung up around the two of
them, so that she could see his face once more, still with that
strange fond smile.</p>
<p>"What are you - what are you <em>doing</em> here?"</p>
<p>A few more steps took Professor Quirrell to a higher part of the
balcony's ramparts, where he put his elbows down on the stone, and
leaned over heavily, looking up into the night.</p>
<p>"I came here straight upon being released by the Aurors, the
moment I finished reporting to the Headmaster," said Professor
Quirrell in a quiet voice, "because I am your teacher, and you are
my student, and I am responsible for you."</p>
<p>Hermione understood, then; remembering what Professor Quirrell
had said to Harry in the second Defense lesson of the year, about
controlling his anger. She felt the flush of shame all the way down
her chest. It took a moment after that for knowledge to override
mortification, for her to force out the words -</p>
<p>"I -" said Hermione. "Harry thinks - that I <em>didn't</em> -
lose my temper, I mean -"</p>
<p>"So I heard," said Professor Quirrell in rather dry tones. He
shook his head, as though at the stars themselves. "The boy is
fortunate that I have crossed the line from annoyance with his
self-destructiveness, into sheer curiosity as to what he shall do
next. But I agree with Mr. Potter's assessment of the facts. This
murder was well-planned to evade detection both by the wards of
Hogwarts and the Headmaster's timely eye. Naturally, in such a
thoughtful murder, some innocent would be placed to take the
blame." A brief, wry smile crossed the Defense Professor's lips,
though he wasn't looking at her. "As for the notion that you did it
yourself - I consider myself a talented teacher, but even I could
not teach such murderous intent to a student as obstinate and
untalented as Hermione Granger."</p>
<p>The part of her brain that said <em>What?</em> in indignation
wasn't anywhere near loud enough to reach her lips.</p>
<p>"No..." said Professor Quirrell. "That is not why I am here. You
have made no effort to hide your dislike for me, Miss Granger. I
thank you for that lack of pretense, for I much prefer true hate to
false love. But you are still my student, and I have a word to say
to you, if you will hear it."</p>
<p>Hermione looked at him, still fighting down the aftereffects of
the adrenaline from before. The Defense Professor seemed to be just
staring up at the dark sky, in which the stars were becoming
visible.</p>
<p>"I was going to be a hero, once," said Professor Quirrell, still
looking upward. "Can you believe that, Miss Granger?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Thank you again, Miss Granger. It is true nonetheless. Long
ago, long before your time or Harry Potter's, there was a man who
was hailed as a savior. The destined scion, such a one as anyone
would recognize from tales, wielding justice and vengeance like
twin wands against his dreadful nemesis." Professor Quirrell gave a
soft, bitter laugh, looking up at the night sky. "Do you know, Miss
Granger, at that time I thought myself already cynical, and yet...
well."</p>
<p>The silence stretched, in the cold and the night.</p>
<p>"In all honesty," said Professor Quirrell, looking up at the
stars, "I still don't understand it. They should have known that
their lives depended on that man's success. And yet it was as if
they tried to do everything they could to make his life
<em>unpleasant.</em> To throw every possible obstacle into his way.
I was not naive, Miss Granger, I did not expect the power-holders
to align themselves with me so quickly - not without something in
it for themselves. But their power, too, was threatened; and so I
was shocked how they seemed content to step back, and leave to that
man all burdens of responsibility. They sneered at his performance,
remarking among themselves how they would do better in his place,
though they did not condescend to step forward." Professor Quirrell
shook his head as though in bemusement. "And it was the strangest
thing - the Dark Wizard, that man's dread nemesis - why, those who
served <em>him</em> leapt eagerly to their tasks. The Dark Wizard
grew crueler toward his followers, and they followed him all the
more. Men fought for the chance to serve <em>him</em>, even as
those whose lives depended on that other man made free to render
his life difficult... I could not understand it, Miss Granger."
Professor Quirrell's face was in shadow, as he looked upward.
"Perhaps, by taking on himself the curse of action, that man
removed it from all others? Was that why they felt free to hinder
his battle against the Dark Wizard who would have enslaved them
all? Believing men would act in their own interest was not
cynicism, it turned out, but sheerest optimism; in reality men do
not meet so high a standard. And so in time that one realized he
might do better fighting the Dark Wizard alone, than with such
followers at his back."</p>
<p>"So -" Hermione's voice sounded strange in the night. "You left
your friends behind where they'd be safe, and tried to attack the
Dark Wizard all by yourself?"</p>
<p>"Why, no," said Professor Quirrell. "I stopped trying to be a
hero, and went off to do something else I found more pleasant."</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " said Hermione without thinking at all. "That's
<em>horrible!</em> "</p>
<p>The Defense Professor turned his head down from the sky to
regard her; and she saw, in the light of the doorway, that he was
smiling - or at least half his face was smiling. "Are you going to
tell me, Miss Granger, that I am an awful person? Well, perhaps I
am. But then are people who never even try to be heroes still
worse? If I had never done anything at all, like them, would you
have thought better of me?"</p>
<p>Hermione opened her mouth and then found that, once again, she
didn't have anything to say. It wasn't right to walk away from
being a hero, you couldn't just <em>do</em> that, but she didn't
<em>want</em> to say that everyone who wasn't a hero was nothing,
that was Quirrell-thinking...</p>
<p>The smile, or half-smile, had disappeared. "You were foolish,"
the Defense Professor said quietly, "to expect any lasting
gratitude from those you tried to protect, once you named yourself
a heroine. Just as you expected that man to go on being a hero, and
called him horrible for stopping, when a thousand others never
lifted a finger. It was only <em>expected</em> that you should
fight bullies. It was a tax you owed, and they accepted it like
princes, with a sneer for the lateness of your payment. And you
have already witnessed, I wager, that their fondness vanished like
dust in the wind once it was no longer in their interest to
associate with you..."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor slowly straightened off the balcony,
standing almost straight, turning to regard her fully.</p>
<p>"But you don't have to be a hero, Miss Granger," said Professor
Quirrell. "You can stop anytime you please."</p>
<p>That idea...</p>
<p>...<em>had</em> occurred to her before, several times over the
last two days.</p>
<p><em>People become who they are meant to be, by doing what is
right,</em> Headmaster Dumbledore had told her. The trouble was
that there seemed to be two different right things to do. There was
the part of her which said that <em>right</em> was to go on being a
heroine, and stay at Hogwarts, she didn't know what was going on
but a heroine wouldn't just run away.</p>
<p>And there was also the voice of common sense saying that young
children shouldn't ever stay around danger, that was what adults
were for; the voice of every school poster that said not to take
candy from strangers. That was also right.</p>
<p>Hermione Granger stood there on that balcony, looking at
Professor Quirrell silhouetted by the emerging stars, and she
didn't understand; she didn't understand how the Defense Professor
could be gazing at her with his face showing concern; she didn't
understand the notes of pain in the Defense Professor's voice that
caught at her; she didn't understand <em>why</em> she was being
told all this.</p>
<p>"You don't even like me, Professor," said Hermione.</p>
<p>A small smile flickered on Professor Quirrell's face. "I suppose
I could go on about how I am angered that this affair has taken up
my valuable time and disrupted my Defense classes. But mostly, Miss
Granger, you are my student, and whatever other professions I may
have once held, I think I have been a good teacher at Hogwarts,
have I not?" Suddenly Professor Quirrell's eyes seemed very tired.
"As your teacher, then, I am advising you that you have other
career options. I should not like to see anyone else going down my
path."</p>
<p>Hermione swallowed. It was a side of Professor Quirrell she'd
never seen or imagined, and it was eating away at her
preconceptions.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell watched her for a moment, and then looked
away from her again, back up at the stars. When he spoke this time
his voice was quieter. "Someone here is targeting you, Miss
Granger, and I cannot ward you as I warded Mr. Malfoy. The
Headmaster has prevented it, for what he claims to be good reasons.
It is easy to become fond of Hogwarts, I know, for I am fond of it
as well. But in France they take a different view of the Ancient
Houses than in Britain; and Beauxbatons would not mistreat you, I
think. Whatever else you imagine of me, I swear that if you asked
me to see you safely in Beauxbatons, I would do all in my power to
convey you there."</p>
<p>"I can't just -" Hermione said.</p>
<p>"But you <em>can,</em> Miss Granger." Now the pale blue eyes
watched her intently. "Whatever you wish to make of your life, you
cannot attain it at Hogwarts, not anymore. This place is ruined for
you now, even leaving aside all other threats. Simply ask Harry
Potter to command you to go to Beauxbatons and live out your life
in peace. If you stay here, he is your master in the eyes of
Britain and its laws!"</p>
<p>She hadn't even been thinking about that, it paled so much in
comparison to being eaten by Dementors; it had been important to
her before, but now it all seemed childish, unimportant, pointless,
so why were her eyes burning?</p>
<p>"And if that fails to move you, Miss Granger, consider also that
Mr. Potter has, just today at lunchtime, threatened Lucius Malfoy,
Albus Dumbledore, and the entire Wizengamot because he cannot think
sensibly when something threatens to take you from him. Are you not
frightened of what he will do next?"</p>
<p>It made sense. Terrible sense. Dreadful awful sense.</p>
<p>It made <em>too much</em> sense -</p>
<p>She couldn't have described it in words, what triggered the
realization, unless it was the sheer <em>pressure</em> that the
Defense Professor was exerting on her.</p>
<p>That if the Defense Professor <em>was</em> behind this whole
thing - then Professor Quirrell had done it all <em>just to get her
out of the way of his plans for Harry.</em></p>
<p>Without any conscious decision, she shifted her weight to the
other foot, her body moving away from the Defense Professor -</p>
<p>"So you think I am the one responsible?" said Professor
Quirrell. His voice sounded a little sad as he said it, and her own
heart almost stopped from hearing it. "I suppose I cannot blame
you. I am the Defense Professor of Hogwarts, after all. But Miss
Granger, even <em>assuming</em> that I am your enemy, common sense
should still tell you to get away from me <em>very quickly</em>.
You cannot use the Killing Curse, so the correct tactic is to
Apparate away. I do not mind being the villain of your imagination
if it makes matters clearer. Leave Hogwarts, and leave me to those
who can handle me. I will arrange for the transportation to be
through some family of good repute, and Mr. Potter will know to
blame me if you do not arrive safely."</p>
<p>"I -" She was feeling cold, the night air chilling her skin, or
maybe being chilled by it. "I've got to think about it -"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell shook his head. "No, Miss Granger. Your
departure will take time for me to arrange, and I have less time
left than you may think. This decision may be painful for you, but
it should not be ambiguous; much weighs in the balance of these
scales, but not evenly. I must know tonight whether you intend to
go."</p>
<p><em>And if not -</em></p>
<p>Was the Defense Professor warning her deliberately? That if she
didn't run, he would strike again?</p>
<p>Why would it matter so much, what did Professor Quirrell want to
<em>do</em> with Harry?</p>
<p><em>Hermione Granger, I shall be less subtle than is usual for a
mysterious old wizard, and tell you outright that you cannot</em>
<em>imagine</em> <em>how badly things could go if the events
surrounding Harry Potter turn to ill.</em></p>
<p>The most powerful wizard in the world had told her that, when he
was talking about how important it was that she <em>not</em> stop
being Harry's friend.</p>
<p>Hermione swallowed, she swayed a little where she stood, on the
stone balcony of a magical castle. Suddenly the whole deadly
absurdity of the situation seemed to rise up and grab her by the
throat, that twelve-year-old girls <em>shouldn't</em> be in danger,
<em>shouldn't</em> be thinking about such things, that Mum would
want her to RUN AWAY and her father would have a heart attack if he
even knew she was being faced with the question.</p>
<p>And she knew, then, as Harry and Dumbledore had both tried to
warn her, that everything she'd ever thought about being a heroine
had been mistaken. That there wasn't really any such thing as
heroes, outside of stories. There was just horrible danger, and
being arrested by Aurors and put in cells next to Dementors, pain
and fear and -</p>
<p>"Miss Granger?" said the Defense Professor.</p>
<p>She said nothing. All the words were blocked in her throat.</p>
<p>"I need a decision, Miss Granger."</p>
<p>She kept her jaw locked, didn't let any words come out.</p>
<p>Finally the Defense Professor sighed. Slowly the white light
failed, and slowly the door behind him swung open, so that he was
once again a black silhouette against the opening. "Good night,
Miss Granger," he said, and turned his back to her, and walked away
into Hogwarts.</p>
<p>It took a while for her breathing to slow down again. Whatever
had happened here tonight, it didn't feel anything like victory.
She'd fought so hard just to stop herself from saying <em>Yes</em>
in the face of the Defense Professor's pressure, and now she didn't
even know if she'd done the right thing.</p>
<p>When she walked back into the light herself (after exhaustion
had overtaken everything and sleep was once more a possibility),
she thought she heard it as she was within the doorway, from behind
her and above her, a distant cawing cry.</p>
<p>But it wasn't meant for her, she knew, so she started climbing
up the stairs toward her dorm room.</p>
<p>The other girls were probably asleep by now, and wouldn't look
at her, or look away -</p>
<p>She felt the tears start, and this time she didn't stop
them.</p>

<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 87: Hedonic Awareness<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p><em>Thursday, April 16th, 1992.</em></p>
<p>The school was almost deserted now, nine-tenths of the students
having gone home for the Easter holiday, just about everyone she
knew missing. Susan had stayed behind, her grand-aunt being quite
busy, as had Ron for reasons she didn't know - maybe the Weasley
family was poor enough that feeding all the children for an extra
week would've been a noticeable strain? It all worked out well
enough, since Ron and Susan were just about the only ones left
who'd still talk to her. (At least that she wanted to talk back
<em>to.</em> Lavender was still nice to her, and Tracey was, um,
Tracey, but neither of them were quite <em>relaxing</em> to spend a
free hour around; and in any case, neither of those two had stayed
over for the Easter hols.)</p>
<p>If she couldn't go <em>home</em> - and she wasn't allowed to go
home, her parents had been lied-to and told she'd had Glowpox -
then an almost-empty Hogwarts was the next best thing.</p>
<p>She could even visit the library without people staring at her,
since there were no lessons and nobody was trying to do
schoolwork.</p>
<p>It would be a mistake to think that Hermione drooped about the
corridors weeping all day long. Oh, she'd cried a lot the first two
days, of course, but two days had been enough. There were parts of
Harry's borrowed books about that, how even people who were
paralyzed in car accidents weren't nearly as unhappy as they'd
expected to be, six months later, just like lottery winners weren't
nearly as happy as they'd expected. People adjusted, their
happiness levels went back to their happiness set point, life went
on.</p>
<p>A shadow fell over where Hermione was reading her current book
and she whirled around, the wand hidden on her lap coming up to
point directly at the surprised face of -</p>
<p>"Sorry!" Harry Potter said, hastily holding up his palms to show
his left hand empty, and his right hand holding a small red-velvet
pouch. "Sorry. Didn't mean to startle you."</p>
<p>There was an awful silence, her heartbeat increasing and her
palms starting to sweat as Harry Potter just looked at her. She'd
<em>almost</em> talked to him, on the first morning of the rest of
her life; but when she'd come down to breakfast Harry Potter had
looked so <em>awful</em> - so she hadn't sat down beside him at the
breakfast-table, just quietly eaten in her own little bubble of
nobody else sitting next to her, and it had been horrible, but
Harry hadn't come to her, and... she just hadn't talked to him,
since then. (It wasn't hard to avoid everyone, if you stayed out of
the Ravenclaw common room, and ran out of classes before anyone
could talk to you.)</p>
<p>And ever since she'd been wondering what Harry thought of her
now - if he hated her for having lost all his money - or if he
really <em>was</em> in love with her and that's why he'd done it -
or if he'd given up on her keeping pace with him because
<em>she</em> couldn't <em>frighten Dementors</em> - she couldn't
face him now, she just couldn't, she spent sleepless nights
worrying what Harry thought of her now, and she was afraid, and
she'd been avoiding the boy who'd spent all his money to save her,
and she was a horrible ungrateful wretch, and a terrible person and
-</p>
<p>Then her eyes glanced down to see that Harry was reaching into
the red-velvet pouch and taking out a heart-shaped red-foil-wrapped
sweet, and her brain melted down like chocolate left out in the
sun.</p>
<p>"I was going to give you more space," said Harry Potter, "only I
was reading up on Critch's theories about hedonics and how to train
your inner pigeon and how small immediate positive and negative
feedbacks secretly control most of what we actually do, and it
occurred to me that you might be avoiding me because seeing me made
you think of things that felt like negative associations, and I
really <em>didn't</em> want to let that run any longer without
doing something about it, so I got ahold of a bag of chocolates
from the Weasley twins and I'm just going to give you one every
time you see me as a positive reinforcement if that's all right
with you -"</p>
<p>"<em>Breathe</em>, Harry," Hermione said without thinking about
it.</p>
<p>It was the first word she'd spoken to him since the day of the
trial.</p>
<p>The two of them stared at each other.</p>
<p>The books stared at them from the surrounding shelves.</p>
<p>They stared some more at each other.</p>
<p>"You're supposed to eat the chocolate," Harry said, holding out
the heart-shaped sweet like a Valentine. "Unless just being given a
chocolate feels good enough to count as a positive reinforcement,
in which case you probably need to put it in your pocket or
something."</p>
<p>She knew that if she tried speaking again she'd fail, so she
didn't try.</p>
<p>Harry's head slumped a bit. "<em>Do</em> you hate me now?"</p>
<p>"<em>No!</em> " she said. "No, you shouldn't think that, Harry!
Just - just - just <em>everything!</em> " She realized that her
wand was still pointed at Harry, and she lowered it. She was trying
very hard not to burst out into tears. "<em>Everything!</em> " she
repeated, and couldn't find any better to say than that, although
she was certain that Harry wanted to tell her to be specific.</p>
<p>"I think I understand," Harry said cautiously. "What're you
reading?"</p>
<p>Before she could stop him, them, Harry bent over the
library-desk to see the book she was reading, leaning his head
forward before she could think to grab the book away -</p>
<p>Harry stared at the open page.</p>
<p>"The World's Wealthiest Wizards and How They Got That Way,"
Harry read off the book's title from the top. "Number sixty-five,
Sir Gareth, owner of a transportation company that won the
19th-century shipping wars... monopoly on oh-tee-threes... I
see."</p>
<p>"I s'pose you're going to tell me that I don't need to worry
about anything and you'll take care of it all?" It came out
sounding harsher than she would've wanted, and she felt another
stab of guilt for being such a terrible person.</p>
<p>"Nah," Harry said, sounding oddly cheerful. "I can put myself in
your shoes well enough to know that if <em>you</em> paid a bunch of
money to save <em>me, I'd</em> be trying to pay it back. I'd know
it was silly on some level, and I'd <em>still</em> be trying to pay
it back all by myself. There's no way I wouldn't understand
<em>that</em>, Hermione."</p>
<p>Hermione's face screwed up and she felt moisture in the corners
of her eyes.</p>
<p>"Fair warning, though," Harry went on, "I might solve the debt
to Lucius Malfoy myself if I see a way before you do, it's more
important to get that sorted immediately than <em>which</em> one of
us gets it sorted. Anything interesting so far?"</p>
<p>Three-quarters of her was running in circles and smashing into
trees as she tried to figure out the implications of everything
Harry had just said (<em>did</em> he still respect her as a
heroine? or did that mean he thought she <em>couldn't</em> do it on
her own?) and meanwhile a much more sensible part of Hermione
flipped back the book to page 37 which had the most promising entry
she'd seen so far (though in her imagination she always did it on
her own and took Harry completely by surprise) -</p>
<p>"I thought this seemed quite interesting," her voice said.</p>
<p>"Number fourteen, 'Crozier', true name unknown," Harry read.
"Wow, that is... that is the gaudiest checkered top hat I've ever
seen. Wealth, at least six hundred thousand Galleons... so around
thirty million pounds, not enough to make a Muggle famous, but good
enough for the smaller wizard population, I guess. Rumored to be a
modern alias of the six-century-old Nicholas Flamel, the only known
wizard to succeed at the incredibly difficult alchemical procedure
for creating the Philosopher's Stone, which enables the
transmutation of base metals into gold or silver as well as... the
Elixir of Life which indefinitely prolongs the youth and health of
the user... Um, Hermione, this seems obviously false."</p>
<p>"I've read more references to Nicholas Flamel," Hermione said.
"<em>The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts</em> says he secretly
trained Dumbledore to stand up to Grindelwald. There's a lot of
books that take the story seriously, not just this one... you think
it's too good to be true?"</p>
<p>"No, of course not," said Harry. Harry pulled out the chair next
to her own, at the small table, and sat down beside her in his
accustomed place on her right, just like he'd never left; she had
to choke back a catch in her throat. "The idea of 'too good to be
true' isn't causal reasoning, the universe doesn't check if the
output of the equations is 'too good' or 'too bad' before allowing
it. People used to think that airplanes and smallpox vaccines were
too good to be true. Muggles have figured out ways to travel to
other stars without even using magic, and you and I can use our
wands to do things that Muggle physicists think are literally
impossible. I can't even imagine what we could rule out the
<em>real</em> laws of magic being able to do."</p>
<p>"So what's the problem, then?" Hermione said. Her voice sounded
more normal now, in her own ears.</p>
<p>"Well..." Harry said. The boy reached over her own outstretched
arm, his robes brushing hers, and tapped the artist's illustration
of an ominously glowing red stone dripping scarlet liquid. "Problem
one is that there's no logical reason why the <em>same</em>
artifact would be able to transmute lead to gold <em>and</em>
produce an elixir that kept someone young. I wonder if there's an
official name for that in the literature? Like the 'turned up to
eleven effect', maybe? If everyone can see a flower, you can't get
away with saying flowers are the size of houses. But if you're in a
flying saucer cult, since nobody can see the alien mothership
anyway, you can say it's the size of a city, or the size of the
Moon. Observable things have to be constrained by evidence, but
when somebody makes up a story, they can make the story as extreme
as they want. So the Philosopher's Stone gives you unlimited gold
<em>and</em> eternal life, not because there's a single magical
discovery that would produce both of those effects, but because
someone made up a story about a super happy thingy."</p>
<p>"Harry, there's a lot of things in magic that aren't sensible,"
she said.</p>
<p>"Granted," said Harry. "But Hermione, problem two is that not
even <em>wizards</em> are crazy enough to casually overlook the
implications of <em>this</em>. <em>Everyone</em> would be trying to
rediscover the formula for the Philosopher's Stone, whole
<em>countries</em> would be trying to capture the immortal wizard
and get the secret out of him -"</p>
<p>"It's not a <em>secret.</em>" Hermione flipped the page, showing
Harry the diagrams. "The instructions are right on the next page.
It's just so difficult that only Nicholas Flamel's <em>done</em>
it."</p>
<p>"So entire countries would be trying to kidnap Flamel and force
<em>him</em> to make more Stones. Come on, Hermione, even wizards
wouldn't hear about <em>immortality</em> and, and," Harry Potter
paused, his eloquence apparently failing him, "and <em>just keep
going.</em> Humans are crazy, but they're not <em>that</em>
crazy!"</p>
<p>"Not everyone thinks the same way <em>you</em> do, Harry." He
did have a point, but... <em>how</em> many different references had
she come across to Nicholas Flamel? Besides <em>World's Wealthiest
Wizards</em> and <em>Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts,</em> there'd
also been <em>Stories of Moderately Ancient Times</em> and
<em>Biographies of the Justly Famous...</em></p>
<p>"All right then, <em>Professor Quirrell</em> would've kidnapped
this Flamel guy. It's what an evil person <em>or</em> a good person
or just a <em>selfish</em> person would do if they had any sense.
The Defense Professor knows a lot of secrets and he wouldn't miss
<em>that</em> one." Harry sighed and looked up; she followed his
gaze, but he was apparently just looking at the larger library, the
rows and rows and rows of bookcases. "I don't mean to mess with
your project," said Harry, "and I certainly don't mean to
discourage you, but... Honestly, Hermione, I'm not sure you're
going to find any good ideas for making money in a book like this.
Like the old joke about how if an economist sees a twenty-pound
note lying in the street, they won't bother picking it up, because
if it were real, someone else would've picked it up already. Any
way of making lots of money that everyone <em>knows</em> about to
the point where it's in books like this... you see what I'm saying?
It can't be possible for everyone to make a thousand Galleons a
month in three easy steps, or everyone would be doing it."</p>
<p>"So? That wouldn't stop <em>you,</em>" Hermione said, her voice
now roughening again. "You do impossible things all the time, I bet
you've done something impossible in the last <em>week</em> and you
didn't bother <em>telling</em> anyone."</p>
<p>(There was a slight pause, which, if Miss Granger had known, was
exactly the length of pause you'd make if you'd fought Mad-Eye
Moody and won exactly eight days earlier.)</p>
<p>"Not in the last seven days, no," Harry said. "Look... part of
the trick of doing the impossible is being selective about
<em>which</em> impossibilities you challenge, and only trying when
you have a special advantage. If there's a money-making method in
this book that sounds difficult for a wizard, but it's easy if we
can use Dad's old Mac Plus, <em>then</em> we'd have a plan."</p>
<p>"I <em>know that,</em> Harry," Hermione said, her voice wavering
only slightly. "I was looking to see if there was anything here I
<em>could</em> figure out how to do. I thought, maybe the difficult
part about making a Philosopher's Stone was that the alchemical
circle had to be super precise, and I could get it right by using a
Muggle microscope -"</p>
<p>"That's <em>brilliant,</em> Hermione!" The boy rapidly drew his
wand, said "<em>Quietus,</em>" and then continued after the small
noises of the rowdier books had died down. "Even if the
Philosopher's Stone is just a myth, the same trick might work for
other difficult alchemies -"</p>
<p>"Well, it <em>can't</em> work," Hermione said. She'd flown
across the library to look up the only book on alchemy that wasn't
in the Restricted Section. And then - she remembered the crushing
letdown, all the sudden hope dissipating like mist. "Because
<em>all</em> alchemical circles have to be drawn 'to the fineness
of a child's hair', it isn't any finer for some alchemies than
others. And wizards <em>have</em> Omnioculars, and I haven't heard
of any spells where you use Omnioculars to magnify things and do
them exactly. I should've realized that!"</p>
<p>"Hermione," Harry said seriously, as he started to dig down into
the red-velvet pouch again, "don't punish yourself when a bright
idea doesn't work out. You've got to go through a <em>lot</em> of
flawed ideas to find one that might work. And if you send your
brain negative feedback by frowning when you think of a flawed
idea, instead of realizing that idea-suggesting is good behavior by
your brain to be encouraged, pretty soon you won't think of any
ideas at all." Harry put down two heart-shaped chocolates beside
the book. "Here, have another chocolate. Besides the one from
earlier, I mean. This one is to reinforce your brain for generating
a good candidate strategy."</p>
<p>"I suppose you're right," Hermione said in a small voice, but
she didn't touch the chocolate. She started to turn the pages back
to 167, where she'd been reading before Harry had come in.</p>
<p>(Hermione Granger did not require <em>bookmarks,</em> of
course.)</p>
<p>Harry was leaning over slightly, his head almost touching her
shoulder, watching the pages as she turned them, as though he might
be able to glean valuable information from glimpsing the page for
only a quarter-second. Breakfast hadn't been long ago, and she
could clearly identify, from the faint scent of his breath, that
Harry'd eaten banana pudding for dessert.</p>
<p>Harry spoke again. "So with all that said... and please take
this as a positive reinforcement... did you really try to invent a
way to <em>mass-produce immortality</em> so that I could <em>pay
off my debt to Lucius Malfoy?</em> "</p>
<p>"Yes," she said in an even smaller voice. Even when she
<em>tried</em> to think like Harry, it seemed she hadn't yet got
the knack of it. "So what've you been doing this whole time,
Harry?"</p>
<p>Harry made a disgusted face. "Trying to collect evidence on the
whole 'Who Framed Hermione Granger' mystery."</p>
<p>"I..." Hermione looked up at Harry. "Shouldn't I... be trying to
solve my <em>own</em> mystery, though?" It hadn't been her first
thought, her first priority, but now that Harry mentioned it...</p>
<p>"That wouldn't work in this case," Harry said soberly. "There's
too many people who'll talk to me and not you... and I'm also sorry
to say that some of them made me promise not to talk to anyone
else. Sorry, I don't think you can help much on this one."</p>
<p>"Okay, I guess," Hermione said leadenly. "Fine. You do
everything. You gather all the clues and talk to all the suspects
while I just sit here in the library. Let me know after it turns
out that it was Professor Quirrell who did it."</p>
<p>"Hermione..." Harry said. "Why is it so important <em>who</em>
does what? Shouldn't it be more important to get everything solved,
than who solves it?"</p>
<p>"I guess you're right," Hermione said. She lifted her hands to
press up at her eyes. "I guess it doesn't matter any more.
Everyone's going to think - I <em>know</em> it's not your fault,
Harry, you were - you were being Good, you were a perfect gentleman
- but no matter what I do now, they'll all think that I'm just -
someone for you to rescue." She paused, and said, with her voice
quivering, "And maybe they're <em>right</em>, Harry."</p>
<p>"Whoa, whoa, hold on there a second -"</p>
<p>"I can't scare Dementors. I can get Outstandings in Charms
class, but I can't scare Dementors."</p>
<p>"<em>I've got a mysterious dark side!</em> " Harry hissed, after
his head turned around to scan the library. (There was one boy in a
distant corner, who did look in their direction occasionally, but
he would've been too far away to hear anything even without the
Quieting Barrier.) "I've got a dark side that <em>definitely</em>
isn't a child, and who knows what other crazy magical stuff going
on in my head - Professor Quirrell claimed that I become whoever I
believe I am - that's all <em>cheating,</em> don't you see,
Hermione? There's an arrangement that the school administration
made that I'm not supposed to talk about, so that the Boy-Who-Lived
could have more time to study every day, I'm <em>cheating</em> and
you're <em>still beating me in Charms class.</em> I'm - I'm
probably not - the Boy-Who-Lived probably isn't even something that
you could properly call a child - and you're <em>still
competing</em> with that. Don't you realize, if it <em>wasn't</em>
for people paying attention to me, you'd look like the most
powerful witch to come along in a century? When you can fight three
older bullies by yourself, and win?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," she said, pressing her hands again over her
eyes, with her voice wavering. "All I know is - even if that's all
<em>true</em> - nobody's ever going to see me for myself anymore,
ever."</p>
<p>"All right," Harry said after a while. "I see what you mean.
Instead of the famous Potter-and-Granger research team, there'll be
Harry Potter and his lab assistant. Um... here's an idea. How about
if I <em>don't</em> focus on making money for a while? I mean, the
debt doesn't come due until I graduate Hogwarts. So you can do it
yourself and show the world you've still got it. And if you
coincidentally crack the secret of immortality along the way, we'll
just call it a bonus."</p>
<p>The thought of Harry relying on <em>her</em> to come up with a
solution seemed... like a crushing burden of responsibility to dump
on a poor traumatized twelve-year-old girl, and she wanted to hug
him for offering her a way to restore her self-respect as a
heroine, and it was what she <em>deserved</em> for being a horrible
person and speaking sharply to Harry all the time, when all along
he'd been a truer friend to her than she'd ever been to him, and it
was good that he still thought she could do things, and...</p>
<p>"Is there some amazing rational thing you do when your mind's
running in all different directions?" she managed.</p>
<p>"My own approach is usually to identify the different desires,
give them names, conceive of them as separate individuals, and let
them argue it out inside my head. So far the main persistent ones
are my Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, Gryffindor, and Slytherin sides, my
Inner Critic, and my simulated copies of you, Neville, Draco,
Professor McGonagall, Professor Flitwick, Professor Quirrell, Dad,
Mum, Richard Feynman, and Douglas Hofstadter."</p>
<p>Hermione considered trying this before her Common Sense warned
that it might be a dangerous sort of thing to pretend. "There's a
copy of <em>me</em> inside your head?"</p>
<p>"Of course there is!" Harry said. The boy suddenly looked a bit
more vulnerable. "You mean there <em>isn't</em> a copy of me living
in <em>your</em> head?"</p>
<p>There <em>was,</em> she realized; and not only that, it talked
in Harry's exact voice.</p>
<p>"It's rather unnerving now that I think about it," said
Hermione. "I do have a copy of you living in my head. It's talking
to me right now using your voice, arguing how this is perfectly
normal."</p>
<p>"Good," Harry said seriously. "I mean, I don't see how people
could be friends without that."</p>
<p>She continued reading her book, then, Harry seeming content to
watch the pages over her shoulder.</p>
<p>She'd gotten all the way to number seventy, Katherine Scott,
who'd apparently invented a way to turn small animals into lemon
tarts, when she finally worked up the courage to speak.</p>
<p>"Harry?" she said. (She was leaning a bit away from him now,
though she didn't realize it.) "If there's a copy of Draco Malfoy
in your head, does that mean you're friends with Draco Malfoy?"</p>
<p>"Well..." Harry said. He sighed. "Yeah, I'd been meaning to talk
with you about this anyway. I kind of wish I'd talked to you
sooner. Anyway, how can I put this... I was corrupting him?"</p>
<p>"What do you mean <em>corrupting?</em> "</p>
<p>"Tempting him to the Light Side of the Force."</p>
<p>Her mouth just stayed open.</p>
<p>"You know, like the Emperor and Darth Vader, only in
reverse."</p>
<p>"<em>Draco Malfoy</em>," she said. "Harry, do you have <em>any
idea -</em>"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"- the sort of things Malfoy has been <em>saying</em> about me?
What he said he'd <em>do</em> to me, as soon as he got the chance?
I don't know what he told to <em>you,</em> but Daphne Greengrass
told me what Malfoy says when he's in Slytherin. It's
<em>unspeakable,</em> Harry! It's unspeakable in the completely
literal sense that I can't say it out loud!"</p>
<p>"When was this?" Harry said. "At the start of the year? Did
Daphne say <em>when</em> this was?"</p>
<p>"No," Hermione said. "Because it doesn't matter when, Harry.
Anyone who said things - like Malfoy said - they can't be a good
person. It doesn't matter what you tempted him to, he's still a
rotten person, because no matter <em>what</em> a good person would
<em>never</em> -"</p>
<p>"You're wrong." Harry said, looking her straight in the eyes. "I
can guess what Draco threatened to do to you, because the second
time I met him, he talked about doing it to a ten-year-old girl.
But don't you see, on the day Draco Malfoy arrived in Hogwarts,
he'd spent his whole previous life being raised by <em>Death
Eaters.</em> It would've required a <em>supernatural
intervention</em> for him to have <em>your</em> morality given
<em>his</em> environment -"</p>
<p>Hermione was shaking her head violently. "<em>No,</em> Harry.
Nobody has to <em>tell</em> you that hurting people is wrong, it's
not something you don't do because the teacher says it's not
allowed, it's something you don't do because - because you can
<em>see when people are hurting,</em> don't you know that, Harry?"
Her voice was shaking now. "That's not - that's not a <em>rule</em>
people follow like the rules for algebra! If you can't <em>see</em>
it, if you can't feel it <em>here,</em>" her hand slapped down over
the center of her chest, not quite where her heart was located, but
that didn't matter because it was all really in the brain anyway,
"then you just don't have it!"</p>
<p>The thought came to her, then, that Harry might <em>not</em>
have it.</p>
<p>"There's history books you haven't read," Harry said quietly.
"There's books you haven't read yet, Hermione, and they might give
you a sense of perspective. A few centuries earlier - I think it
was definitely still around in the seventeenth century - it was a
popular village entertainment to take a wicker basket, or a bundle,
with a dozen live cats in it, and -"</p>
<p>"Stop," she said.</p>
<p>"- roast it over a bonfire. Just a regular celebration. Good
clean fun. And I'll give them this, it was cleaner fun than burning
women they thought were witches. Because the way people are built,
Hermione, the way people are built to <em>feel</em> inside -" Harry
put a hand over his own heart, in the anatomically correct
position, then paused and moved his hand up to point toward his
head at around the ear level, "- is that they hurt when they see
their <em>friends</em> hurting. Someone inside their circle of
concern, a member of their own tribe. That feeling has an
off-switch, an off-switch labeled 'enemy' or 'foreigner' or
sometimes just 'stranger'. That's how people are, if they don't
<em>learn</em> otherwise. So, no, it does <em>not</em> indicate
that Draco Malfoy was inhuman or even unusually evil, if he grew up
believing that it was fun to hurt his enemies -"</p>
<p>"If you believe that<em>,</em>" she said with her voice
unsteady, "if you <em>can</em> believe that, then you're evil.
People are always responsible for what they do. It doesn't matter
what anyone <em>tells</em> you to do, you're the one who does it.
Everyone knows that -"</p>
<p>"<em>No they don't!</em> You grew up in a post-World-War-Two
society where 'I vas only followink orders' is something
<em>everyone knows</em> the bad guys said. In the fifteenth century
they would've called it honourable fealty." Harry's voice was
rising. "Do you think you're, you're just <em>genetically</em>
better than everyone who lived back then? Like if you'd been
transported back to fifteenth-century London as a baby, you'd
realize <em>all on your own</em> that burning cats was wrong,
witch-burning was wrong, slavery was wrong, that every sentient
being ought to be in your circle of concern? Do you think you'd
<em>finish</em> realizing all that by the first day you got to
Hogwarts? Nobody ever <em>told</em> Draco he was personally
responsible for becoming more ethical than the society he grew up
in. And <em>despite that</em>, it only took him four months to get
to the point where he'd grab a Muggleborn falling off a building."
Harry's eyes were as fierce as she'd ever seen him. "I'm not
<em>finished</em> corrupting Draco Malfoy, but I think <em>he's
done pretty well so far.</em>"</p>
<p>The problem with having such a good memory was that she
<em>did</em> remember.</p>
<p>She remembered Draco Malfoy grabbing her wrist, so hard she'd
had a bruise afterward, while she was falling off the roof of
Hogwarts.</p>
<p>She remembered Draco Malfoy helping her up, after that
mysterious tripping jinx had sent her stumbling into the Slytherin
Quidditch Captain's plate of food.</p>
<p>And she remembered - it was, in fact, the reason she'd brought
up the topic in the first place - how she'd felt when she'd heard
Draco Malfoy's testimony under Veritaserum.</p>
<p>"Why didn't you <em>tell</em> me any of this?" Hermione said,
and despite herself, her voice rose in pitch. "If I'd
<em>known</em> -"</p>
<p>"It wasn't my secret to tell you," Harry said. "Draco's the one
who would've been at risk, if his father had found out."</p>
<p>"I'm not stupid, Mr. Potter. What's the <em>real</em> reason you
didn't tell me, and what were you <em>actually</em> doing with Mr.
Malfoy?"</p>
<p>"Ah. Well..." Harry broke eye contact with her, and looked down
at the library table.</p>
<p>"Draco Malfoy told the Aurors under Veritaserum that he wanted
to know if he could beat me, so he challenged me to a duel to
<em>test it empirically</em>. Those were his <em>exact words</em>
according to the transcript."</p>
<p>"Right," Harry said, still not meeting her eyes. "Hermione
Granger. Of <em>course</em> she'll remember the exact wording. It
doesn't matter if she's chained to her chair, on trial for murder
in front of the entire Wizengamot -"</p>
<p>"What were you <em>really</em> doing with Draco Malfoy?"</p>
<p>Harry winced, and said, "Probably not <em>quite</em> what you're
thinking, but..."</p>
<p>The horror scaled and scaled within her, and finally broke
loose.</p>
<p>"<em>You were doing SCIENCE with him?</em> "</p>
<p>"Well -"</p>
<p>"<em>You were doing SCIENCE with him? You were supposed to be
doing science with ME!</em> "</p>
<p>"It wasn't like that! It's not like I was doing <em>real</em>
science with him! I was just, you know, <em>teaching</em> him some
harmless bits of Muggle science, like elementary physics with
algebra and so on - it's not like I was doing original magical
research with him, the way I was with you -"</p>
<p>"And I suppose you didn't tell <em>him</em> about <em>me,</em>
either?"</p>
<p>"Um, of course not?" Harry said. "I've been doing science with
him since October, and he wasn't exactly ready to hear about you
then -"</p>
<p>The inexpressible sense of betrayal inside her was welling and
welling, taking over everything, her rising voice, her glaring
eyes, her nose that she was certain was starting to run, the
burning in her throat. She shoved herself up from the table and
took a step back, the better to look down on her betrayer, and her
voice was very nearly screeching as she yelled, "<em>That is not
okay! You can't do science with two people at once!</em> "</p>
<p>"Er -"</p>
<p>"I mean, you can't do science with two different people and
<em>not tell them about each other!</em> "</p>
<p>"Ah..." Harry said cautiously. "I <em>did</em> think of that,
and I was very careful not to get your research mixed together with
anything I did with him -"</p>
<p>"You were being <em>careful."</em> She would have
<em>hissed</em> it, if it had contained any Ss.</p>
<p>Harry raised a hand and rubbed at his messy hair, and somehow
that made her want to scream at him even <em>more.</em> "Miss
Granger," said Harry, "I think this conversation has become
<em>metaphorical</em> on a level that's, um..."</p>
<p><em>"What?</em> " she screeched at him, at the top of her lungs
inside their Quieting barrier.</p>
<p>Then she realized and got so red that if she'd had an adult
level of magical power her hair would have spontaneously caught on
fire.</p>
<p>The lone other patron in the library, the Ravenclaw boy sitting
in the far opposite corner, was staring wide-eyed at both of them
while making a rather sad attempt to conceal it by holding up a
book just below his face.</p>
<p>"Right," Harry said with a small sigh. "So, keeping <em>firmly
in mind</em> that it was just a bad metaphor, and that <em>real
scientists</em> collaborate with each other <em>all the time,</em>
I don't think that I was cheating. Scientists often keep quiet
about projects they're working on. You and I are doing research
that we're keeping secret, and there were reasons not to tell Draco
Malfoy in particular - he wouldn't have stayed around me at all, in
the beginning, if he'd known I was your friend and not your rival.
And Draco would've been the one at risk if I'd told anyone else
about <em>him</em> -"</p>
<p>"Is that really all?" she said. "<em>Really,</em> Harry? You
didn't want both of us to <em>feel special,</em> like we were the
<em>only</em> ones you wanted to be with and the <em>only</em> ones
who got to be with you?"</p>
<p>"That was <em>not</em> why I -"</p>
<p>Harry paused.</p>
<p>Harry looked at her.</p>
<p>All the blood was rushing back into her face, there probably
should've been steam coming out of her ears, which in turn
should've been melting off her head with the liquid flesh running
down into her neck, as she realized what she'd just blurted
out.</p>
<p>Harry was staring at her in dawning and complete terror.</p>
<p>"Well..." she said in a rather high-pitched voice, "it's... oh,
I don't know, Harry! <em>Is</em> it just a metaphor? When a boy
spends a hundred thousand Galleons to save a girl from certain
doom, she's entitled to wonder, don't you think? It's like being
bought flowers, only, you see, rather <em>more</em> so -"</p>
<p>Harry shoved himself up from the table and took a staggering
step back, even as he brought up his arms to wave frantically.
<em>"That's not why I did it! I did it because we're
friends!</em> "</p>
<p>"Just friends?"</p>
<p>Harry Potter's breathing was starting to scale up toward
hyperventilation. "Very good friends! Extra-special friends, even!
Best friends forever, possibly! But not <em>that</em> kind of
friends!"</p>
<p>"Is it really that awful to think about?" she said with a catch
in her voice. "I mean - I'm not saying <em>I'm</em> in love with
<em>you,</em> but -"</p>
<p>"Oh, you're not? Thank <em>goodness.</em>" Harry brought up the
sleeve of his robe and wiped across his forehead. "Look, Hermione,
please don't misunderstand, I'm sure you're a wonderful person
-"</p>
<p>She took a staggering step back.</p>
<p>"- but - even with my dark side -"</p>
<p>"Is <em>that</em> what this is about?" said Hermione. "But I - I
wouldn't -"</p>
<p>"No, no, I mean, I have a mysterious dark side and probably
other weird magic stuff going on, you <em>know</em> I'm not a
normal child, not really -"</p>
<p>"It's okay to not be normal," she said, feeling increasingly
desperate and confused. <em>"I'm</em> okay with it -"</p>
<p>"But <em>even with all that weird magical stuff</em> letting me
be more adult than I should be, I haven't gone through puberty yet
and there's no hormones in my bloodstream and my brain is
<em>physically incapable</em> of falling in love with anyone. So
I'm not in love with you! I couldn't possibly be in love with you!
For all I know at this point, six months from now my brain is going
to wake up and decide to fall in love with Professor Snape! Er, can
I take it from this that you <em>have</em> been through
puberty?"</p>
<p>"Eep," said Hermione in a high-pitched sound. She swayed where
she stood, and a moment later Harry was rushing over to her side
and helping lower her to sit on the ground, bracing her body with
firm hands.</p>
<p>The fact was that she <em>had</em> staggered over to Professor
McGonagall's office back in December, not in total surprise because
she'd done her reading, but still rather <em>queasily</em> and it
was with great relief that she'd learned that witches had Charms to
deal with the inconveniences and <em>what was Harry even doing
asking a poor innocent girl a question like that -</em></p>
<p>"Look, I'm <em>sorry</em>," Harry said frantically. "I really
didn't mean most of that the way it sounded! I'm sure that anyone
taking the outside view of the whole situation and offering betting
odds on who I finally married would assign a higher probability to
you than anyone else I can think of -"</p>
<p>Her intelligence, which had barely been starting to pull itself
together, promptly exploded into sparks and flame.</p>
<p>"- though not necessarily a probability higher than fifty
percent, I mean, from the outside view there's a lot of other
possibilities, and who I like before I hit puberty probably isn't
all that strongly <em>diagnostic</em> of who I'll be with seven
years later - I don't want to sound like I'm <em>promising</em>
anything -"</p>
<p>Her throat was making some sort of high-pitched sounds and she
wasn't really listening to exactly what. All her universe had
narrowed to Harry's terrible, terrible voice.</p>
<p>"- and besides I've been reading about evolutionary psychology,
and, well, there are all these suggestions that one man and one
woman living together happily ever afterward may be more the
exception rather than the rule, and in hunter-gatherer tribes it
was more often just staying together for two or three years to
raise a child during its most vulnerable stages - and, I mean,
considering how many people end up horribly unhappy in traditional
marriages, it seems like it might be the sort of thing that needs
some clever reworking - especially if we actually do solve
immortality -"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Tano Wolfe, of fifth-year Ravenclaw, slowly stood up from his
library desk, from which vantage point he'd just watched Granger
flee the library, sobbing. He hadn't been able to hear the
argument, but it had clearly been one of <em>those.</em></p>
<p>Slowly and with his knees trembling, Tano approached the
Boy-Who-Lived, who was staring in the direction of the library
doors, still vibrating from the force of how they'd been
slammed.</p>
<p>Tano didn't particularly want to do this, but Harry Potter
<em>had</em> been Sorted into Ravenclaw. The Boy-Who-Lived was,
technically, his fellow Ravenclaw. And that meant there was a
Code.</p>
<p>The Boy-Who-Lived didn't say anything as Tano approached him,
but his gaze wasn't friendly.</p>
<p>Tano swallowed, laid a hand on Harry Potter's shoulder, and
recited, his voice cracking only slightly, "Witches! Go figure,
huh?"</p>
<p>"<em>Remove your hand before I cast it into the outer
darkness.</em>"</p>
<p>The library doors slammed open again in the wake of another
departure.</p>

<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 88: Time Pressure, Pt 1<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>April 16th, 1992.</p>
<p>12:07pm.</p>
<p>Lunchtime.</p>
<p>Harry stomped over to the mostly-deserted Gryffindor table,
determining at a glance that lunch today was breen and Roopo balls.
The ambient conversation, Harry could likewise hear, was
Quidditch-related; an auditory environment which rated somewhat
worse than the sound of rusty chainsaws, but better than what the
Ravenclaw table was still <em>blithering</em> about Hermione.
Gryffindor House, at least, had started out less sympathetic to
Draco Malfoy and had more political incentive to wish that everyone
would just forget certain unfortunate facts; and if that wasn't the
right reason for silence, it was at least silence. Dean and Seamus
and Lavender were all gone for the holidays, but at least that
left...</p>
<p>"What was all that ruckus at the Head Table?" Harry said to the
Weasley-twin group-mind, as he began to serve himself his own
plate. "It looked like it was just ending as I walked in."</p>
<p>"Our beloved, but clumsy Professor Trelawney -"</p>
<p>"Seems to have gone and dropped an entire soup tureen on herself
-"</p>
<p>"Not to mention Mr. Hagrid."</p>
<p>A quick glance at the Head Table confirmed that the Divination
Professor was waving her wand frantically as the half-Giant dabbed
at his clothes. Nobody else seemed to be paying much attention,
even Professor McGonagall. Professor Flitwick was standing on his
chair as usual, the Headmaster seemed to be absent again (he'd been
gone most days of the holiday), Professors Sprout and Sinistra and
Vector were eating in their usual grouping, and -</p>
<p>"You know," Harry said, as he turned his head away to stare at
the ceiling illusion of a clear blue sky, "that still creeps me out
sometimes."</p>
<p>"What does?" said Fred or George.</p>
<p>The powerful and enigmatic Defense Professor was 'resting' or
whatever-the-heck-was-wrong-with-him, his hands making fumbling,
hesitant grabs at a chicken-leg that seemed to be eluding him on
the plate.</p>
<p>"Eh, nothing," said Harry. "I'm not quite used to Hogwarts,
yet."</p>
<p>Harry continued to eat in moderate silence, as various Weasleys
discussed some bizarre mind-affecting substance called Chudley
Cannons.</p>
<p>"What sort of deep mysterious thoughts are you thinking?" said a
young-looking witch with short hair, sitting nearby. "I mean, just
curious. I'm Brienne, by the way." She was gazing at him with one
of those looks which Harry had firmly decided to just ignore until
he was older.</p>
<p>"So," Harry said, "you know those really simple Artificial
Intelligence programs like ELIZA that are programmed to use words
in syntactic English sentences only they don't contain any
understanding of what the words mean?"</p>
<p>"Of course," the witch said. "I have a dozen of them in my
trunk."</p>
<p>"Well, I'm pretty sure my understanding of girls is somewhere
around that level."</p>
<p>A sudden hush fell.</p>
<p>It took a few seconds for Harry to realize that, no, the entire
Great Hall wasn't staring at <em>him,</em> and then Harry twisted
his head around to look.</p>
<p>The figure who'd just staggered into the Great Hall appeared to
be Mr. Filch, Hogwarts's token hallway monitor; who, along with his
predatory cat Mrs. Norris, constituted a low-level random encounter
whom Harry often breezed past wearing his epic-level Deathly
Hallow. (Harry had once consulted the Weasley twins about pulling
some sort of prank on this deserving target, whereupon Fred or
George had quietly pointed out that Mr. Filch was never seen to use
a wand, which was odd, really, considering how many spells would be
useful in that position, and it made you wonder why Dumbledore had
given the man a position at Hogwarts, and Harry had shut up.)</p>
<p>Right now Mr. Filch's brown clothing was disarrayed and soaked
with sweat, his shoulders were visibly heaving as he breathed, and
his everpresent cat was missing.</p>
<p>"Troll -" gasped Mr. Filch. "In the dungeons -"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Minerva McGonagall stood up from the Head Table so quickly that
her chair fell to the ground behind her.</p>
<p>"<em>Argus!</em> " she cried. "What happened to you?"</p>
<p>Argus Filch staggered forward from the huge doors, his upper
body streaked and dotted with small crimson dots as though someone
had spattered steak sauce over his face. "Troll - grey - twice as
tall as me - it - it -" Argus Filch covered his face with his
hands. "It ate Mrs. Norris - ate her all up, in just one bite
-"</p>
<p>Minerva felt a stab of dismay in her other self, she hadn't
liked the other cat very much but the two of them had still been
felines.</p>
<p>An uproar started from the Great Hall. Severus stood up from the
Head Table, somehow doing so without drawing any visible attention
to himself, and strode out the huge doors without another word.</p>
<p><em>Of course,</em> Minerva thought, <em>the third-floor
corridor - this could be a distraction -</em></p>
<p>She mentally consigned all such matters to Severus's care, drew
her wand, raised it high, and let out five sharp cracks of purple
fire.</p>
<p>There was stunned silence but for Argus's broken sobs.</p>
<p>"It seems we have a dangerous creature loose in Hogwarts," she
said to the faculty at the Head Table. "I will ask you all to aid
in searching the halls." Then she turned to the stunned and
watching students, and raised her voice. <em>"Prefects - lead your
houses back to the dormitories immediately!"</em></p>
<p>Percy Weasley leaped up from the Gryffindor table. "Follow me!"
he said in a high voice. "Stick together, first-years! No, not
<em>you</em> -" but by that time the other prefects were raising
their own voices as a renewed babble sprang up.</p>
<p>Then a clear, cool voice spoke under the sudden rush of
sound.</p>
<p>"Deputy Headmistress."</p>
<p>She turned.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor was calmly wiping off his hands on a
napkin as he stood up from the Head Table. "With respect," said the
man of unknown identity, "you are not expert in battle tactics,
madam. In this situation, it would be wiser to -"</p>
<p>"I do apologize, Professor," said Professor McGonagall, as she
turned toward the great doors. Filius and Pomona had already risen
to follow her, with Rubeus Hagrid towering over all of them as the
half-giant stood up. She'd been through similar experiences too
many times, at this point. "Sad experience has taught me that on
occasions such as these, it is not a good time to take any advice
the current Defense Professor may offer. Indeed, I think it wise
that the two of us search for the troll together, so that no
suspicions may be cast upon you for any untoward events which occur
during that time."</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, the Defense Professor swung smoothly on
the Gryffindor table and clapped his hands with a sound like a
floor cracking through.</p>
<p>"Michelle Morgan of House Gryffindor, second in command of
Pinnini's Army," the Defense Professor said calmly into the
resulting quiet. "Please advise your Head of House."</p>
<p>Michelle Morgan climbed up onto her bench and spoke, the tiny
witch sounding far more confident than Minerva remembered her being
at the start of the year. "Students walking through the hallways
would be spread out and impossible to defend. All students are to
remain in the Great Hall and form a cluster in the center...
<em>not</em> surrounded by tables, a troll would jump right over
tables... with the perimeter defended by seventh-year students.
From the armies only, no matter how good they are at
<em>duelling,</em> so they don't get in each other's lines of
fire." Michelle hesitated. "I'm sorry, Mr. Hagrid, but - it
wouldn't be safe for you, you should stay behind with the students.
And Professor Trelawney shouldn't confront a troll on her own
either," Michelle sounded much less apologetic about this part,
"but if she's paired with Professor Quirrell the two of them
together can form an additional trusted and effective battle unit.
That concludes my analysis, Professor."</p>
<p>"Adequate, for being put on the spot," the Defense Professor
said. "Twenty Quirrell points to you. But you neglect the still
simpler point that <em>home</em> does not mean <em>safe,</em> and a
troll is strong enough to rip a portrait door off its hinges -"</p>
<p>"Enough," Minerva snapped. "Thank you, Miss Morgan." She looked
to the watching tables. "Students, you will do as she said." Turned
back to the Head Table. "Professor Trelawney, you will accompany
the Defense Professor -"</p>
<p>"Ah," Sybill said falteringly. Beneath her overdone makeup and
mess of shawls, the woman looked rather pale. "I'm afraid - I'm not
entirely well today - indeed, I feel rather faint -"</p>
<p>"You won't have to fight the troll," Minerva said sharply, her
patience taxed as usual when dealing with the woman. "Just stay
with the Defense Professor and do not let him out of your sight for
an instant, you must be able to testify afterward that you were
with him at all times<em>.</em>" She turned to Rubeus. "Rubeus, I
am leaving you in charge here. Keep them safe." The huge man
straightened at this, losing his glum look and nodding proudly to
her.</p>
<p>Then Minerva looked at the students, and raised her voice. "It
should go entirely without saying that anyone leaving the Great
Hall <em>for any reason,</em> will be expelled. No excuses will be
accepted. Am I understood?"</p>
<p>The Weasley twins, with whom she'd been making direct eye
contact, nodded respectfully.</p>
<p>She turned without another word and marched off toward the hall
doors with the other Professors behind her.</p>
<p>On the far side of the room, unnoticed on the wall, a clock
showed 12:14pm.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>...and he still didn't realize.</p>
<p><em>Tick.</em></p>
<p>As Harry stared with narrowed eyes at where the Professors had
gone out, wondering what was actually going on and what it meant,
as the students came together into a more defensible mass and wands
flicked to levitate the tables out of their way, Harry still didn't
realize.</p>
<p><em>Tick.</em></p>
<p>"Shouldn't the Professors <em>all</em> have formed up into
pairs?" said an older Gryffindor student whose name Harry didn't
know. "I mean - it'd be slower, but it'd be safer, I think -"</p>
<p><em>Tick.</em></p>
<p>Someone else replied to this, raising her voice, but Harry
didn't catch much of it, the gist was that mountain trolls were
highly magic-resistant and incredibly strong and could regenerate
but they were still <em>noisy</em> so if you heard them coming, it
shouldn't be that hard for a Hogwarts Professor to wrap them up in
Vadim's Unbreakable something something.</p>
<p><em>Tick.</em></p>
<p>And Harry still didn't realize.</p>
<p><em>Tick.</em></p>
<p>The crowd noises were subdued, people were talking in low voices
to each other while they glanced around, listening for the sound of
a crashing door or an angry roar.</p>
<p><em>Tick.</em></p>
<p>Some students were speculating in whispers about what the
Defense Professor could possibly be trying to achieve by smuggling
in a troll, and whether he was angry that Professor McGonagall had
caught on to his attempted distraction, and what it was a
distraction <em>from.</em></p>
<p><em>Tick.</em></p>
<p>And the thought still didn't come to Harry, not until after all
the students had formed a mass of perhaps a hundred bodies
patrolled by proudly grim-looking seventh-year-students with their
wands all pointed outward, and somebody suggested doing a
headcount, and someone else replied sarcastically that this might
have made sense on some other day, but right now practically
everyone was gone for the spring holiday and nobody really knew how
many students were supposed to be in the room, let alone if any
were missing.</p>
<p><em>Tick.</em></p>
<p>That was when Harry wondered where Hermione was.</p>
<p><em>Tick.</em></p>
<p>Harry looked over at where the Ravenclaws had clustered, he
didn't see Hermione but then everyone was packed tightly-enough
together that you wouldn't expect to see smaller students through
the crowd, amid the upper-years.</p>
<p><em>Tick.</em></p>
<p>Harry then looked over at the Hufflepuffs to see if he could
spot Neville, and even though Neville was standing behind a much
taller student, Harry's visual processing managed to spot him
almost immediately. Hermione wasn't with the Hufflepuffs either,
not that Harry could see - and she certainly wouldn't be with the
Slytherins -</p>
<p><em>Tick.</em></p>
<p>Harry pushed his way through the packed crowd, stepping beside
or around older students and in one case just ducking between their
legs, until he was standing among the Ravenclaws and could
definitely verify that, nope, no Hermione.</p>
<p><em>Tick.</em></p>
<p>"Hermione Granger!" Harry said loudly. "Are you here?"</p>
<p>Nobody answered.</p>
<p><em>Tick.</em></p>
<p>Somewhere in the back of his mind was a rising sense of horror,
as other parts of him tried to decide exactly how much to panic.
The first Defense class of the year was rather fuzzy in Harry's
mind, but he distantly remembered something about trolls being able
to track prey that was alone and undefended.</p>
<p><em>Tick.</em></p>
<p>Another track of thought searched frantically through inchoate
possibilities, what could he <em>do</em> exactly? It wasn't 3pm yet
so he couldn't reach this <em>now</em> using his Time-Turner. Even
if he could sneak out of the room - there had to be some way to put
on his Cloak without being noticed, some sort of distraction he
could use - he had no idea <em>where</em> Hermione was, and
Hogwarts was huge.</p>
<p><em>Tick.</em></p>
<p>Another part of his mind tried to model possibilities. From what
that other student had said, trolls weren't <em>silent</em>
predators, they were noisy -</p>
<p><em>Hermione won't have any idea it's a troll, so she'll go
investigate the noise. She's a heroine, isn't she?</em></p>
<p>- but Hermione now had an invisibility cloak and a broomstick in
her pouch. Harry had insisted on that part for both her and
Neville, and Professor McGonagall had told him it'd been done. That
ought to be enough to let Hermione get away, even if she was lousy
on a broomstick. All she had to do was get onto a section of roof,
it was a clear day and sunlight was supposed to be bad for trolls
somehow, Harry remembered that part and therefore Hermione would
remember it exactly. And surely, even if Hermione wanted to prove
herself again, she couldn't possibly be dumb enough to attack a
mountain troll.</p>
<p><em>Tick.</em></p>
<p>She wouldn't.</p>
<p><em>Tick.</em></p>
<p>That just wasn't <em>her.</em></p>
<p><em>Tick.</em></p>
<p>And then it occured to Harry that somebody had previously tried
to frame Hermione Granger for murder using Memory Charms. Had done
so inside Hogwarts, without setting off any alarms. And had
arranged for Draco to die slowly enough that it wouldn't set off
the wards until at least six hours later when nobody could use a
Time-Turner to check. And that whoever was clever enough to
infiltrate a troll past the ancient wards of Hogwarts without the
Headmaster coming to investigate the strange creature, could be
clever enough to <em>also</em> take the obvious step of jinxing
Hermione's magic items...</p>
<p><em>Tick.</em></p>
<p>There was a part of him that felt something like slowly rising
panic as perspective shifted, a Necker Cube changing orientation,
what the <em>hell</em> had Harry been thinking, letting Hermione
and Neville be kept inside Hogwarts just because of them being
given a few stupid trinkets, that wasn't going to stop anyone who
wanted to <em>kill them</em>.</p>
<p><em>Tick.</em></p>
<p>Another part of his mind put up resistance, that possibility
wasn't <em>certain</em>, it was complex and the probability could
easily be under 50%. It was easy to imagine going into a huge panic
in front of everyone and then Hermione getting back from the
washrooms outside the Great Hall. Or if the troll ended up not
going anywhere near her... like in the story of the boy who cried
wolf, nobody would believe him the next time if she really was in
trouble; it could use up reputational credit that he would later
need for something else...</p>
<p><em>Tick.</em></p>
<p>Harry recognized an instance of the fear-of-embarrassment schema
that stopped most people from ever doing anything under conditions
of uncertainty, and squashed it down hard. Even then it was strange
how much willpower it took to muster the decision to shout out loud
in front of everyone, if he just hadn't seen Hermione in the crowd
it was going to be embarrassing...</p>
<p><em>Tick.</em></p>
<p>Harry drew in a deep breath and shouted as loudly as he could,
<em>"Hermione Granger! Are you here?"</em></p>
<p>The students all turned to look at him. Then some of them turned
around to look around themselves. The noise around the room went
down in volume as some conversations stilled.</p>
<p><em>"Has anyone seen Hermione Granger since -</em> since around
ten-thirty today or so? <em>Does anyone have any idea where she
might be?"</em></p>
<p>The background babble stilled further.</p>
<p>Nobody raised their voice to shout anything at him, in
particular not, <em>Don't worry, Harry, I'm right here.</em></p>
<p>"Oh, Merlin," somebody said from nearby, and then the background
babble started up again, taking on a new and excited tone.</p>
<p>Harry stared down at his hands, shutting out the yammering and
tried to think, think, <em>THINK -</em></p>
<p><em>Tick.</em></p>
<p><em>Tick.</em></p>
<p><em>Tick.</em></p>
<p>Susan Bones and a redheaded boy with a battered-looking wand
both shoved their way through the crowd to Harry at the same
time.</p>
<p>"We've got to let the Professors know somehow -"</p>
<p>"We've got to go find her -"</p>
<p><em>"Find her?"</em> Susan snapped, rounding on the other boy.
"How'll we do <em>that</em>, Captain Weasley?"</p>
<p>"We'll go off and <em>look</em> for her!" Ron Weasley snapped
back.</p>
<p>"Are you nuts? There's already Professors searching the
hallways, what makes you think we've got any better chance than
them of running across General Granger? Only <em>we'll</em> get
eaten by the troll! And then expelled!"</p>
<p>It was odd, how sometimes hearing bad ideas made the right idea
obvious by contrast.</p>
<p>"<em>All right everyone! Listen up!</em> "</p>
<p>People turned to look.</p>
<p>"<em>QUIET! EVERYONE! SHUT UP!</em> "</p>
<p>Harry's throat ached after that, but he had everyone's
attention.</p>
<p>"I have a broomstick," Harry said as loudly as he could manage
with his throat still hurting. He'd remembered Azkaban, and the
broomstick which had only sat two, when he'd requested one that
could carry three. "It's a 3-seater. I need one seventh-year from
the armies to come with me. We're going to fly through the hallways
as fast as possible looking for Hermione Granger, pick her up, and
come back immediately. Who's with me?"</p>
<p>The Great Hall became entirely silent, then.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Students glanced at each other uneasily. The younger students
looked expectantly at the older students, while they in turn turned
to look at the students who were guarding the perimeter. Most of
those were staring straight ahead, pointing their wands just in
case the troll picked that moment to burst through a wall.</p>
<p>No one moved.</p>
<p>No one spoke.</p>
<p>Harry Potter spoke again. "We're not going to <em>fight</em> the
troll. If we see it we'll just fly away and there's no way it'll be
able to keep up with us on a broomstick. I'll take responsibility
for squaring it with the administration. <em>Please.</em>"</p>
<p>People went on looking at other people.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry stared at the silent crowd, the dozen seventh-years
looking sternly outward, feeling the coldness coming over him.
Somewhere in the back of his mind, Professor Quirrell was laughing
scornfully and mocking the idea that ordinary fools would ever do
something useful of their own will, without a wand pointed at their
heads...</p>
<p><em>Tick.</em></p>
<p>The standard remedy for bystander apathy was to focus on a
single individual. "All right," Harry said, trying to keep the
commanding voice of the Boy-Who-Lived who didn't doubt obedience.
"Miss Morgan, come with me, now. We've got no time to waste."</p>
<p>The witch he'd named turned from where she'd been staring
steadily out at the perimeter, her expression aghast for the one
second before her face closed up.</p>
<p>"The Deputy Headmistress ordered us all to stay <em>here</em>,
Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>It took an effort for Harry to unclench his teeth. "Professor
Quirrell didn't say that and neither did you. Professor McGonagall
isn't a tactician, she didn't think to check if we had missing
students and <em>she</em> thought it was a good idea to start
marching students through the hallways. But Professor McGonagall
<em>understands</em> after her mistakes are pointed out to her, you
saw how she listened to you and Professor Quirrell, and I'm certain
that she wouldn't want us to just ignore the fact that Hermione
Granger is <em>out there, alone -"</em></p>
<p><em>Tick.</em></p>
<p>"I'd expect the Professor to say she'd not wish any more
students roaming the halls. The Professor said if anyone left for
any reason, they'd be expelled. Maybe <em>you</em> don't need to
worry because you're the Boy-Who-Lived, but the rest of us
<em>do!</em> "</p>
<p><em>Tick.</em></p>
<p>Somewhere in the back of his mind, Professor Quirrell was just
laughing at him. Expecting some <em>normal</em> person to act
without perfect strategic clarity, without a clear focus of
responsibility on them personally, when they had a <em>good excuse
to do nothing...</em> "A student's life is at stake," Harry said in
a level voice. "She could be fighting the troll right now. Out of
curiosity, does that mean anything to you at all?"</p>
<p><em>Tick.</em></p>
<p>Miss Morgan's face twisted. "You - you're the Boy-Who-Lived!
Just go off by yourself and snap your fingers, if you want to help
her!"</p>
<p><em>Tick.</em></p>
<p>Harry was hardly even aware of what he was saying. "That's just
cleverness and bluffing, I don't have any power like that in real
life, a young girl needs your help <em>now are you a Gryffindor or
not?"</em></p>
<p>"Why are you saying any of this to <em>me?</em> " cried Miss
Morgan. "I wasn't left in charge here! Mr. Hagrid was!"</p>
<p>There was an awkward pause that suffused the whole room.</p>
<p>Harry spun to look up at the huge half-giant towering over the
crowd of students, as all other heads also turned toward him as
one.</p>
<p>"Mr. Hagrid," Harry said, trying to keep his voice commanding.
"You need to authorize this expedition and you need to do it
now."</p>
<p>Rubeus Hagrid looked conflicted, though that was hard to judge
with his vast head so surrounded by his unshorn beard and locks;
only his eyes looked alive, embedded in all that hair. "Eh..." said
the half-giant. "I was tol' to keep yeh all safe -"</p>
<p>"Great, now can we also keep Hermione Granger safe? You know,
the student framed for <em>a murder she did not commit</em> who
needs <em>someone to help her?"</em></p>
<p>The half-giant startled as Harry spoke the words.</p>
<p>Harry stared at the enormous man, desperately willing him to
pick up on the hint, hoping the words hadn't given it away to
anyone else - he couldn't be just muscle, surely James and Lily had
been friends with this man out of more than pity -</p>
<p>"Framed?" called out an anonymous voice, from somewhere over
near where the Slytherins gathered. "Ha, are you still on that?
It'd serve her right if she did get eaten."</p>
<p>There was some laughter, even as cries of indignation came from
elsewhere.</p>
<p>The half-giant's face firmed up. "Yeh stay here, lad," Mr.
Hagrid said in a booming tone that was probably meant to be gentle.
"I'll go and look fer her meself. Truth is, trolls can be a mite
tricky - yeh've got to catch 'em by an ankle and dangle 'em just
right, or they'll rip yeh clean in half -"</p>
<p>"Can you ride a broomstick, Mr. Hagrid?"</p>
<p>"Eh -" Rubeus Hagrid frowned. "No."</p>
<p>"Then you can't search fast enough. <em>Sixth-years! Calling all
sixth-years! Are there any sixth-years here who aren't worthless
cowards?"</em></p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>"<em>Fifth years?</em> Mr. Hagrid, tell them they're authorized
to go with me and keep me safe! <em>I'm trying to be sensible, damn
it!</em> "</p>
<p>The half-giant wrung his hands with an agonized expression. "Eh
- I -"</p>
<p>Something snapped inside Harry and he started to stride directly
toward the doors to the Great Hall, pushing aside anyone who didn't
get out of his way as though they were doughy statues. (He didn't
run, because running was an invitation for somebody to stop you.)
Somewhere in his mind he was moving through an empty room filled
with mechanical puppets by whose meaningless lip-moving noises he'd
been <em>distracted</em> -</p>
<p>A huge figure interposed itself in his way.</p>
<p>Harry looked up.</p>
<p>"I can't let yeh do that, Harry Potter, not yeh of all people.
There's strange things afoot in this castle, and someone might be
after Miss Granger - or they might be after <em>yeh.</em>" Rubeus
Hagrid's voice was regretful but firm, and his gigantic hands lay
at his side like forklifts. "I can't let yeh go out there, Harry
Potter."</p>
<p>"<em>Stupefy!</em> "</p>
<p>The red bolt crashed into the side of Hagrid's head and made the
huge man startle. His head snapped around faster than anything that
large should've moved, and bellowed, "<em>What do yeh think yeh're
doing!</em> " at the young form of Susan Bones.</p>
<p>"<em>Sorry!</em> " she screamed. "<em>Incendium!
Glisseo!</em> "</p>
<p>The huge man's hands, now slapping at the fire in his beard,
didn't quite manage to catch himself as he crashed to the floor,
but it didn't matter by then because Harry was past him and -</p>
<p>Neville Longbottom stepped in front of him, looking desperate
but determined, the Hufflepuff boy's wand already level in his
hand.</p>
<p>Harry's hand went for his wand in a sheer reflex action, he
barely managed to check himself before Neville could fire on him,
staring at his Lieutenant as though the world had gone mad.</p>
<p>"Harry!" Neville burst out. "Harry, Mr. Hagrid's right, you
<em>can't</em>, this could all be a trap, they could be after
<em>you -</em>"</p>
<p>All of Neville's muscles went rigid and he toppled to the
ground, stiff as a board.</p>
<p>A pale-looking Ron Weasley stepped out from behind Neville, his
own wand level, and said, "Go."</p>
<p><em>"Ron, you madman, what are you doing -</em>" came a voice
distantly identifiable as Miss Clearwater's boyfriend, but Harry
was already dashing for the door without looking back, even as
Ron's voice and Susan's voice rose again in incantation. There was
a huge indignant bellow, and unknown voices began to yell.</p>
<p>Then Harry was through, his hand reaching into his pouch and his
voice was saying <em>"broomstick",</em> as behind him the great
doors began to swing shut again.</p>
<p>Harry continued running through the Entrance Hall even as the
long three-person broomstick and its sets of stirrups began to
protrude from the pouch, repeating a number of swearwords in his
head and thinking <em>this is what happens when you try to be
sensible</em> with the part of his mind that wasn't trying to
figure out a search pattern to cover places where Hermione might
be. The Library was on the third floor and practically on the other
side of the castle... Harry had almost reached the great marble
staircase by the time the broomstick was in his hand and
<em>"Up!</em> " he was in the air and accelerating up toward the
second floor -</p>
<p>"<em>Gah!</em> " Harry screamed, and barely managed to spin his
broom in the air so that he didn't impale one of the human figures
lurking at the top of the stairs. There was a ghastly moment of
trying not to fall off the broom, perform the twists that would
keep him in the stirrups, despite being really close to the ground
and having almost no room to maneuver and then -</p>
<p>"<em>Fred? George?</em> "</p>
<p>"We can't figure out how to find her!" one of the Weasley twins
blurted, hands twisting in distress. "We snuck out because we
thought we could find Miss Granger - there <em>has</em> to be a
quick way to find anyone inside the Hogwarts castle, we're both
sure of it - but we can't figure out what it is!"</p>
<p>Harry stared at both of them, from where he was hanging upside
down from the broomstick where his desperate maneuver had brought
him, and entirely by reflex his mouth said, "Well, <em>why</em>
were you so sure you could find her?"</p>
<p>"We <em>don't know!"</em> cried the other Weasley twin.</p>
<p>"Have you been able to find people inside Hogwarts before?"</p>
<p>"<em>Yes!</em> We -" and the Weasley twin who was speaking
stopped abruptly, both redheads staring off into the distance with
a blank expression.</p>
<p>There was a thundering crash, as of two huge doors being shoved
open by someone very, very strong.</p>
<p>Harry spun around in the air to present the two open
stirrup-positions on the broomstick to the Weasley twins, he didn't
say anything, there was no reason for them to give away their
positions if they didn't have to. Time seemed to move too slowly as
the Weasley twins scrambled into the stirrups, Harry's heart
beating hard despite his mental calculation that Mr. Hagrid,
running, shouldn't reach even the foot of the stairway in time.
Then the three of them were accelerating <em>hard</em> and away
toward the nearest corridor, the stone floor beneath them blurring
and the walls seeming to make an audible whooshing sound (though
that was just the wind in their ears) as they went past; Harry
remembered that he was riding a longer three-person broomstick
barely in time to <em>slow down</em> for the next turn.</p>
<p>And now all the broomstick seats were occupied, but if they
actually found Hermione then - Harry could put on the Cloak of
Invisibility, that should hide him from the troll, and that would
free up a seat for Hermione -</p>
<p>Harry ducked hard before a sudden archway took his head off.</p>
<p>"We found Jesse!" the Weasley twin seated behind Harry blurted.
"I know we did! That time we needed to tell him that Filch was
hunting for him!"</p>
<p>"How?" Harry said, most of his brain engaged in not dying in a
horrible air accident. He should have slowed down for safety, but
there was a tension rising in him, a sourceless dread. He
<em>couldn't</em> slow down, something terrible would happen if he
slowed down...</p>
<p>"We -" said the Weasley twin seated lower down. "We can't
remember!"</p>
<p>Another sharp turn taken at, Harry estimated, roughly 0.3% of
the speed of light, and they were going through a twisty curving
corridor that Harry always took to get from the Great Hall to the
library only it <em>wasn't</em> the shortest way if you were <em>on
a broomstick,</em> he should've taken the long straight West
Corridor instead -</p>
<p>The part of his brain that wasn't steering caught up with
reality.</p>
<p>"Someone's been tampering with your minds!" Harry yelled, as he
weaved through the curving corridor so fast that the tail-end
Weasley sometimes lightly smacked into the wall as the length of
the broomstick conflicted with Harry's maladapted air skills.</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " cried Fred or George.</p>
<p>"Whoever got to Hermione messed with your minds too!" It could
be an Obliviation, it could be a False Memory that hadn't been
planted right, but right now Harry couldn't <em>think -</em></p>
<p>The broomstick turned and shot upward beside a spiral staircase,
all three of them flattened themselves against the broomstick so
they could make in through the gap in the ceiling that opened onto
the third floor, and then they were in front of the library, the
broomstick slowing to a halt with a shriek despite the lack of
anything it could be friction-braking against. Harry shot the
Weasley twins a quick glance to <em>stay put</em>, as he clambered
off the broomstick to shove open the doors of the library,
controlling his breathing as he shoved his head inside.</p>
<p>Hermione Granger wasn't there.</p>
<p>Madam Pince, who was eating a sandwich at her desk, looked up
with a sudden glare. "Library's closed!"</p>
<p>"Have you seen Hermione Granger?" Harry said.</p>
<p>"I said the library's <em>closed,</em> boy! Lunch hours!"</p>
<p>"This is extremely important. Have you seen Hermione Granger or
do you have any idea where she might be?"</p>
<p>"No, now be off!"</p>
<p>"Do you have any fast way of contacting Professor McGonagall in
an emergency?"</p>
<p>"Eh?" said the librarian, startled. She rose up from behind her
desk. "What is -"</p>
<p>"Yes or no. Please answer immediately."</p>
<p>"Ah - there's the Floo -"</p>
<p>"She's not in her office," Harry said. "Do you have any other
way of reaching her. Yes or no."</p>
<p>"Young man, I insist that you -"</p>
<p>Harry's brain flagged this as <em>I'm talking to NPCs again</em>
and he spun on his heel and dashed back for the broomstick.</p>
<p>"Stop!" cried Madam Pince, bursting too late from the doors as
Harry and the Weasley twins shot off again, out of the librarian's
sight. The pressure in Harry's mind still rising, like a physical
hand squeezing his chest, <em>he had to find Hermione</em> and he
had no other notion of where she could be, unless it was the
witches' dorms in the Ravenclaw tower and that he couldn't enter.
Searching all of Hogwarts bordered on a mathematical impossibility,
there probably was no continuous flight path that entered all the
rooms at least once - <em>why</em> hadn't he thought to demand for
Hermione and Neville and him to be given a set of those neat little
mirrors the Aurors used to communicate -</p>
<p>The realization that he was being <em>stupid</em> hit Harry like
a blow to the stomach. He didn't need mirrors to send a message, he
hadn't needed mirrors since January. Harry slowed the broomstick to
a halt in midair of a hallway, his wand already coming into his
hand, the driving will to <em>protect Hermione Granger</em> rising
to the front of his mind like a sun of silver fire and flowing down
his arm as he cried</p>
<p>"<em>EXPECTO PATRONUM!</em> "</p>
<p>and the blazing white humanoid burst into existence like a nova,
the Weasley twins' voices crying aloud in shock.</p>
<p>"Tell Hermione Granger - that there's a troll loose in Hogwarts
- it could be hunting for her - she needs to get into direct
sunlight, now!"</p>
<p>The silver figure turned as though it was departing, and then
vanished.</p>
<p>"Merlin's underpants," breathed Fred or George.</p>
<p>The silver outline blasted back into the world, and said in the
strange outside version of Harry's own voice, "Hermione Granger
says," the blazing figure's voice became higher-pitched,
<em>"AHHHHHHHHH!</em> "</p>
<p>Time seemed to fracture, like everything was moving very quickly
and slowly at the same time. A desperate impulse to accelerate the
broomstick, fly at its maximum speed, only Harry didn't <em>know
where</em> -</p>
<p>"If you know where she is," Harry shouted to the blazing
humanoid figure, staring into it as though it were a sun, "then
<em>take me to her!"</em></p>
<p>The silver blaze moved and Harry accelerated after it, the
Weasley twins giving out high-pitched shrieks behind him as he
fired through the air like a cannonball, moving faster than sanity,
he didn't focus on the walls whizzing past him or how fast he was
moving, just followed the silver light through corridors and flying
up staircases and blitzing through doors that Fred or George cried
desperate incantations to open and it was <em>all still taking too
much time,</em> somewhere deep inside Harry felt like he was
sinking through molasses as windows and portraits shot past.</p>
<p>The broomstick screamed through a final turn that whacked one of
the Weasley twins against the wall not quite as hard as a Bludger
would hit, and then they followed the brilliant Patronus through an
open space in the ceilings, blasting up and upwards, rising past
one floor and then another in less than a breath.</p>
<p>His Patronus slowed to a halt (Harry braking hard in response)
just as they reached the level of a wide-open floor space that that
spread out until it escaped the ceiling and turned into an outdoor
terrace, a spread of tiled marble open to the air and sky -</p>
</div>
<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 89: Time Pressure, Pt 2<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>Cool blue fires clung to the floor in small masses, surrounding
a blazing pool that seemed to burn with a deadlier, hotter
blue.</p>
<p>In one narrow circle the marble tiles were scorched and
shattered by some explosive spell that only the most prodigious of
first-year witches could have cast, with the last of her
strength.</p>
<p>On the terrace, <em>still moving</em> beneath the open sunlight,
stood a great lumpy creature of dull granite-grey. Body like a
boulder with small bald head perched on top like a stone, short
legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. One hand held a
tremendous stone club as long and as wide as an adult human, and
the other hand held</p>
<p>The Weasley twins screamed.</p>
<p>Harry's Patronus shattered.</p>
<p>The troll snorted and spun around to face them, dropping</p>
<p>into the red pool that had spread out beneath its feet, raising
its club high.</p>
<p>Then a Weasley cried an incantation and the club was torn from
the troll's hand, smashed into its face so hard it drove the troll
back for one of its steps, a blow that might have killed a Muggle.
The troll gave a bellow of anger, its nose squashed and
blood-spattered, and then the nose straightened once more,
regenerated. The troll grabbed with both hands for the club, which
shot away through the air but only barely dodged the grab.</p>
<p>"Lead it away, keep it off me," said a voice.</p>
<p>The levitated club moved backwards from the troll, from the
terrace onto the wide-open floor beneath the ceiling; and the troll
made a great prodigious leap that almost brought the club into its
hands. Then the troll made another great leap as the club moved to
one side; and the broomstick moved forwards and Harry jumped off
and ran towards where Hermione Granger was lying in a pool of her
own blood with her legs eaten away to the upper thighs.</p>
<p>Harry's hands tore open the healer's kit from his pouch, grabbed
one of the self-tightening tourniquets, wrapped them around one
ragged tooth-marked stump, his hands briefly slipping in the blood,
they didn't tremble, there wasn't any allowance for his hands to
tremble. As the tourniquet formed a complete loop it tightened hard
and more blood came out, but then the bleeding stopped on that
thigh-stump, and Harry turned to the other. Part of his mind was
screaming, screaming, screaming and even the part of him picking up
the other self-tightening tourniquet heard it, but that also wasn't
allowed.</p>
<p>The two Weasley twins were shouting spells, one after another in
rapid-fire casting that would have had Harry unconscious in sixty
seconds, sometimes the twins shouted two spells simultaneously in
perfect coordination, but most of the spells were disrupting in
harmless showers of sparks against the troll's skin. As the other
tourniquet tightened itself in another pulse of blood, Harry looked
up at a "<em>Diffindo!" / "Reducto!</em> " that made the troll's
vulnerable eyes explode in twin showers of vitreous humor, but the
troll only bellowed once more, its eyes already reforming.</p>
<p>"<em>Fire and acid!</em> " Harry shouted. "<em>Use fire or
acid!</em> "</p>
<p><em>"Fuego!"</em> / <em>"Incendio!"</em> Harry heard, but he
wasn't looking, he was reaching for the syringe of glowing orange
liquid that was the oxygenating potion, pushing it into Hermione's
neck at what Harry hoped was the carotid artery, to keep her brain
alive even if her lungs or heart stopped, so long as her brain
stayed intact everything else could be fixed, it had to be possible
for magic to fix it, it had to be possible for magic to fix it, it
had to be possible for magic to fix it, and Harry pushed the
plunger of the syringe all the way down, creating a faint glow
beneath the pale skin of her neck. Harry then pushed down on her
chest, where her heart should be, hard compressions that he hoped
was moving the oxygenated blood around to where it could reach her
brain, even if her heart might have stopped beating, he hadn't
actually thought to check her pulse.</p>
<p>Then Harry stared at the other things in his medical kit, his
mind going blank as he tried to figure out what else of what was
there, if anything, he could use. The screaming in that distant
corner of his mind was getting louder, much louder, now that his
hands had stopped their frantic motions. He was suddenly aware of
the liquid sensation where blood had soaked through his robes and
the knees of his pants.</p>
<p>From behind Harry came the sound of another bellow from the
troll, and he heard one of the Weasley twins shout <em>"Deligitor
prodeas!"</em> and then, <em>"HELP! Do something!"</em></p>
<p>Harry twisted his head back to look, and saw that one of the
Weasley twins was somehow now wearing the Sorting Hat on his head,
facing off against the troll which held the huge stone club in both
its hands, looking somewhat scorched now and with one or two
smoking scars across its arms, but still intact.</p>
<p>And then the voice of the Hat bellowed in a voice so loud it
seemed to shake the walls,</p>
<p><em>"GRYFFINDOR!"</em></p>
<p>A pulse of power burned the air, magic feeling almost tangible
even to Harry's young senses, the troll jumped back a pace with a
snort of surprise. Fred or George, with a strange look on his face,
swept the Hat off his head with a motion smooth as a magician's
trick, and reached in with one hand and drew forth a hilt whose
pommel was a glowing ruby, followed by a wide crossguard of
gleaming white metal, and a blade as long as a tall child. As the
sword was revealed the air seemed to fill with a silent scream of
fury.</p>
<p>Upon the blade was written in golden script, <em>nihil
supernum.</em></p>
<p>Then the Weasley twin raised the sword aloft as though the huge
blade weighed nothing, and screamed and charged.</p>
<p>Harry's lips opened to say something, some long sentence like,
<em>No, stop, you have no idea how to use a sword</em> but not even
a single syllable left his lips before the sword sliced off the
troll's right arm through the elbow, cutting through skin and flesh
and bone like jelly; just as the already-swinging arc of the stone
club smashed into the charging Weasley twin and sent him flying
through the air above the marble floor, over the gap out of which
they'd risen on the broomstick, until that Weasley hit the wall on
the opposite side and then collapsed into an unmoving heap.</p>
<p>The bright sword vanished down into the opening in the floor,
clattering distantly as it dropped.</p>
<p><em>"Fred!</em> " screamed George Weasley, and then
<em>"VENTUS!"</em></p>
<p>An invisible blow caught the troll and hurled it sideways
through the air.</p>
<p>"<em>VENTUS!</em> "</p>
<p>The troll was hit again, blown to the edge of the floor and the
gap leading downwards.</p>
<p><em>"VENTUS!"</em></p>
<p>But the troll had reached down and grabbed at the floor, its
remaining hand crunching through marble to gain a firm hold. The
third blow sent the troll's body over the gap; but the hand
remained at the edge. And then the troll was pulling itself back up
single-handedly, roaring.</p>
<p>George Weasley staggered, almost falling, his hand dropping to
his side. "Harry -" the Weasley twin said in a strained voice, "Run
-"</p>
<p>The remaining Weasley twin took a step sideways, slumped against
the wall, and slid to the ground.</p>
<p>Time was fractured in Harry's mind, the world around him seemed
to move slowly, distorted, or perhaps it was his own mind twisting
and folding. He should have been moving, doing something, but a
strange paralysis seemed to be stopping all his muscles, all his
motions. Without any time for words, thoughts came in flashes of
concepts: that if Harry ran away the troll would eat the Weasley
twins as well as Hermione, that if Bludgers didn't kill wizards
then Fred should still be alive, that the Weasley twins were more
powerful spellcasters than him and they hadn't been able to hold
back the troll, there was no time to Transfigure anything he didn't
already possess, the troll seemed too agile to be lured over the
edge of the terrace to fall off the sides of the Hogwarts castle,
someone had enchanted the troll against sunlight before using it as
a murder weapon and might also have strengthened it in other ways.
And then a mental image of Hermione running from the troll, running
for sunlight, finally reaching the bright terrace with the troll
hot on her heels, only to find that someone else had thought of
that possibility, too.</p>
<p>The screaming horror in his mind was drowned out by another
emotion.</p>
<p>Harry stood up.</p>
<p>On the other side of the room, the enemy had also risen, the
unregenerating stump of one sword-cut arm still bloody.</p>
<p><em>intent to kill</em></p>
<p>The troll grasped its fallen club in its remaining hand, and
gave a huge bellow, smashing the club into the floor and sending
marble chips flying.</p>
<p><em>think purely of killing</em></p>
<p>The troll began to lumber towards where George had fallen, a
thin string of drool trailing from the side of its lips.</p>
<p><em>grasp at any means to do so</em></p>
<p>Harry took five strides forward, and the enemy gave another
bellow and turned away from George, its eyes focusing squarely on
him.</p>
<p><em>censors off, do not flinch</em></p>
<p>The third most perfect killing machine in nature bounded towards
him in leaping steps.</p>
<p><em>KILL</em></p>
<p>Harry's left hand already held the Transfigured diamond from his
ring, his right hand already held his wand.</p>
<p><em>"Wingardium Leviosa."</em></p>
<p>Harry's wand directed the tiny jewel into the troll's mouth.</p>
<p><em>"Finite Incantatem."</em></p>
<p>The troll's head blew off its spine as the rock expanded back
into its old form, and Harry stepped aside as the Enemy's body
crashed where he'd been standing.</p>
<p>The enemy's head was already beginning to regenerate, the ragged
stump of the jaw and spine smoothing over, the mouth completing
itself and replacing its teeth.</p>
<p>Harry bent down and picked up the troll's head by its left ear.
His wand jammed through the troll's left eye, plunging through the
jelly-like material and passing through the wide socket in the
bone. Harry visualized a one-millimeter-wide cross-section through
the enemy's brain, and Transfigured it into sulfuric acid.</p>
<p>The enemy stopped regenerating.</p>
<p>Harry threw the corpse over the edge of the terrace and turned
back to Hermione.</p>
<p>Her eyes were moving, and focused on him.</p>
<p>Harry scrambled down beside her, ignoring the blood soaking more
of his already-soaked robes. <em>You'll be all right,</em> his
brain formed the sentence, but his lips wouldn't move. <em>You'll
be all right, we'll find some magic to fix all this, put you back
to normal, just hold on, don't -</em></p>
<p>Hermione's lips were moving, just a tiny bit but they were
moving.</p>
<p>"your... fault..."</p>
<p>Time froze. Harry should have told her not to talk, to save her
breath, only he couldn't unblock his lips.</p>
<p>Hermione drew in another breath, and her lips whispered, "Not
your fault."</p>
<p>Then she exhaled, and closed her eyes.</p>
<p>Harry stared at her with his mouth half-open, his breath caught
in his throat.</p>
<p>"Don't do this," said his voice. He'd only been two minutes
late.</p>
<p>Hermione suddenly convulsed, her arms twitching into the air as
though reaching up for something, and her eyes flew open again.
There was a burst of <em>something</em> that was magic and also
more, a shout louder than an earthquake and containing a thousand
books, a thousand libraries, all spoken in a single cry that was
Hermione; too vast to be understood, except that Harry suddenly
knew that Hermione had whited out the pain, and was glad not to be
dying alone. For a moment it seemed like the outpouring of magic
might hold, take root in the castle's stone; but then the
outpouring ended and the magic faded, her body stopped moving and
all motion halted as Hermione Jean Granger ceased to exist -</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Harry stood up from the body, swaying.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>There was a burst of flame and Dumbledore was standing there
with Fawkes, his eyes filled with horror. "I felt a student die!
What -"</p>
<p>The old wizard's eyes saw what lay upon the ground.</p>
<p>"Oh, no," whispered Albus Dumbledore. Fawkes gave a sad,
mournful croon.</p>
<p>"Bring her back."</p>
<p>There was silence on the terrace. Fred Weasley had risen up into
the air at a gesture from Dumbledore's wand and was floating
towards them, surrounded by a reassuring pink glow.</p>
<p>"Harry -" the old wizard began. His voice cracked. "Harry -"</p>
<p>"Have Fawkes cry on her or whatever. Hurry up." The voice that
spoke sounded perfectly calm.</p>
<p>"I, I can't, Harry, it's too late, she's dead -"</p>
<p>"I don't want to hear about it. If it was me lying there, you'd
pull some kind of amazing rabbit out of your hat and save me,
right, because the hero isn't allowed to die before the story's
over. Well, she's the hero too, so whatever you were saving for
that extra-special occasion, just go ahead and use it now. I
promise I'll pay you back."</p>
<p><em>"There isn't anything I can do! Her soul has departed, she's
passed on!"</em></p>
<p>Harry opened his mouth to scream out all his fury, and then
closed it again. There wasn't any point in screaming, it wouldn't
accomplish anything. The unbearable pressure rising inside him
couldn't be let out that way.</p>
<p>Harry turned away from Dumbledore and looked down at where the
remains of Hermione Granger were lying in a pool of blood. Part of
his mind was hammering at the world around him, trying to make it
go away, wake up from the nightmare and find himself back in his
Ravenclaw dorm room with the morning sun shining through the
curtains. But the blood remained and Harry didn't wake up, and
another part of him already knew that this event was real, part of
the same flawed world that included Azkaban and the Wizengamot
chamber and</p>
<p>No</p>
<p>With a fracturing feeling, as though time was still torn to
pieces around him, Harry turned away from Dumbledore and looked
down at the remains of Hermione Granger lying in a pool of blood
with two tourniquets tied around her thigh-stumps, and decided</p>
<p><em>No.</em></p>
<p><em>I do not accept this.</em></p>
<p><em>There isn't any reason to accept it, not when there's magic
in the world.</em></p>
<p>Harry would learn whatever he had to learn, invent whatever he
had to invent, rip the knowledge of Salazar Slytherin from the Dark
Lord's mind, discover the secret of Atlantis, open any gates or
break any seals necessary, find his way to the root of all magic
and reprogram it.</p>
<p>He would rip apart the foundations of reality itself to get
Hermione Granger back.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"The crisis is over," the Defense Professor said. "You may
dismount, Madam."</p>
<p>Trelawney, who had been sitting behind him on the two-person
broomstick that had just blazed through Hogwarts burning directly
through all the walls and floors in their way, hastily pulled
herself off and then sat down hard on the floor, a pace away from
the red-glowing edges of a newly made gap in the wall. The woman
was still breathing in gasps, bending over herself as though she
were on the verge of vomiting out something larger than she
was.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor had felt the boy's horror, through the
link that existed between the two of them, the resonance in their
magic; and he had realized that the boy had sought the troll and
found it. The Defense Professor had tried to send an impulse to
retreat, to don the Cloak of Invisibility and flee; but he'd never
been able to influence the boy through the resonance, and hadn't
succeeded that time either.</p>
<p>He'd felt the boy give himself over fully to the killing
intention. That was when the Defense Professor had begun burning
through the substance of Hogwarts, trying to reach the battle in
time.</p>
<p>He'd felt the boy exterminate his enemy in seconds.</p>
<p>He'd felt the boy's dismay as one of his friends died.</p>
<p>He'd felt the fury the boy had directed at some annoyance who
was likely Dumbledore; followed by an unknown resolution whose
unyielding hardness even he found adequate. With any luck, the boy
had just discarded his foolish little reluctances.</p>
<p>Unseen by anyone, the Defense Professor's lips curved up in a
thin smile. Despite its little ups and downs, on the whole this had
been a surprisingly good day -</p>

<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The four of them gathered once more around the ancient desk of
the Headmaster of Hogwarts, with its drawers within drawers within
drawers, wherein all the past paperwork of the Hogwarts School was
stored; legend had it that Headmistress Shehla had once gotten lost
in that desk, and was, in fact, still there, and wouldn't be let
out again until she got her files organized. Minerva didn't
particularly look forward to inheriting those drawers, when she
inherited that desk someday - if any of them survived.</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore was seated behind his desk, looking grave and
composed.</p>
<p>Severus Snape was standing next to the dead Floo and its ashes,
hovering ominously like the vampire that students sometimes accused
him of pretending to be.</p>
<p>Mad-Eye Moody had been meant to join them, but was yet to
arrive.</p>
<p>And Harry...</p>
<p>A boy's small, thin frame, perched on the arm of his chair, as
though the energies running through him were too great to allow
ordinary seating. Set face, sweaty hair, intent green eyes, and
within it all, the jagged lightning-bolt of his never-healing scar.
He seemed grimmer, now; even compared to a single week earlier.</p>
<p>For a moment Minerva flashed back to her trip to Diagon Alley
with Harry, what seemed like ages and ages ago. There'd been this
somber boy <em>inside</em> that Harry, somehow, even then. This
wasn't entirely her own fault, or Albus's fault. And yet there was
something almost unbearably sad about the contrast between the
young boy she'd first met, and what magical Britain had made of
him. Harry had never had much of an ordinary childhood, she'd
gathered; Harry's adoptive parents had said to her that he'd spoken
little and played less with Muggle children. It was painful to
think that Harry might have had only a few months of playing beside
the other children in Hogwarts, before the war's demands had
stripped it all away. Maybe there was another face that Harry
showed to the children his own age, when he wasn't staring down the
Wizengamot. But she couldn't stop herself from imagining Harry
Potter's childhood as a heap of firewood, and herself and Albus
feeding the wooden branches, piece by piece, into the flames.</p>
<p>"Prophecies are strange things," said Albus Dumbledore. The old
wizard's eyes were half-lidded, as though in weariness. "Vague,
unclear, meaning escaping like water held between loose fingers.
Prophecy is ever a burden, for there are no answers there, only
questions."</p>
<p>Harry Potter was sitting tensely. "Headmaster Dumbledore," said
the boy with soft precision, "my friends are being targeted.
Hermione Granger almost went to Azkaban. The war has begun, as you
put it. Professor Trelawney's prophecy is key information for
weighing up the balance of my hypotheses about what's going on. Not
to mention how silly it is - and <em>dangerous</em> - that the Dark
Lord knows the prophecy and <em>I don't</em>."</p>
<p>Albus looked a grim question at her, and she shook her head in
reply; in whatever unimaginable way Harry had discovered that
Trelawney had made the prophecy and that the Dark Lord knew of it,
he hadn't learned that much from her.</p>
<p>"Voldemort, seeking to avert that very prophecy, went to his
defeat at your hands," the old wizard said then. "His knowledge
brought him only harm. Ponder that carefully, Harry Potter."</p>
<p>"Yes, Headmaster, I do understand that. My home culture also has
a literary tradition of self-fulfilling and misinterpreted
prophecies. I'll interpret with caution, rest assured. But I've
already guessed quite a bit. Is it safer for me to work from
partial guesses?"</p>
<p>Time passed.</p>
<p>"Minerva," said Albus. "If you would."</p>
<p>"The one..." she began. The words came falteringly to her
throat; she was no actress. She couldn't imitate the deep, chilling
tone of the original prophecy; and yet somehow that tone seemed to
carry all the <em>meaning.</em> "The one with the power to vanquish
the Dark Lord approaches... born to those who have thrice defied
him, born as the seventh month dies..."</p>
<p>"<em>And the Dark Lord shall mark him as his equal,</em>" came
Severus's voice, making her jump within her chair. The Potions
Master loomed tall by the fireplace. "<em>But he shall have power
the Dark Lord knows not... and either must destroy all but a
remnant of the other, for those two different spirits cannot exist
in the same world.</em>"</p>
<p>That last line Severus spoke with so much foreboding that it
chilled her bones; it was almost like listening to Sybill
Trelawney.</p>
<p>Harry was listening with a frown. "Can you repeat that?" said
Harry.</p>
<p>"<em>The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord
approaches, born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the
seventh month -</em>"</p>
<p>"Actually, hold on, can you write that down? I need to analyze
this <em>carefully</em> -"</p>
<p>This was done, with both Albus and Severus watching the
parchment hawklike, as though to make sure that no unseen hand
reached in and snatched the precious information away.</p>
<p>"Let's see..." Harry said. "I'm male and born on July 31st,
check. I did in fact vanquish the Dark Lord, check. Ambiguous
pronoun in line two... but I wasn't born yet so it's hard to see
how my parents could have thrice defied <em>me.</em> This scar is
an obvious candidate for the mark..." Harry touched his forehead.
"Then there's the power the Dark Lord knows not, which probably
refers to my scientific background -"</p>
<p>"No," said Severus.</p>
<p>Harry looked at the Potions Master in surprise.</p>
<p>Severus's eyes were closed, his face tightened in concentration.
"The Dark Lord could obtain that power by studying the same books
as you, Potter. But the prophecy did not say, <em>power the Dark
Lord has not.</em> Nor even, <em>power the Dark Lord cannot
have.</em> She spoke of <em>power the Dark Lord knows not</em>...
it will be something stranger to him than Muggle artifacts.
Something perhaps that he cannot comprehend at all, even having
seen it..."</p>
<p>"Science is not a bag of technological tricks," Harry said.
"It's not just the Muggle version of a wand. It's not even
knowledge like memorizing the periodic table. It's a different way
of <em>thinking.</em>"</p>
<p>"Perhaps..." the Potions Master murmured, but his voice was
skeptical.</p>
<p>"It is hazardous," Albus said, "to read too far into a prophecy,
even if you have heard it yourself. They are things of exceeding
frustration."</p>
<p>"So I see," Harry said. His hand rose up, rubbed the scar on his
forehead. "But... okay, if <em>this</em> is really all we know...
look, I'll just put it bluntly. How do you <em>know</em> that the
Dark Lord actually survived?"</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " she cried. Albus just sighed and leaned back
in the vast Headmaster's chair.</p>
<p>"Well," Harry said, "imagine how this prophecy sounded back when
it was made. You-Know-Who learns the prophecy, and it sounds like
I'm destined to grow up and overthrow him. That the two of us are
meant to have a final battle where either of us must destroy all
but a remnant of the other. So You-Know-Who attacks Godric's Hollow
and <em>immediately</em> gets vanquished, leaving behind
<em>some</em> remnant which may or may not be his disembodied soul.
Maybe the Death Eaters are his remnant, or the Dark Mark. This
prophecy could already be fulfilled, is what I'm saying. Don't get
me wrong - I do realize that my interpretation sounds stretched.
Trelawney's phrasing doesn't seem natural for describing
<em>only</em> the events that historically happened on October
31st, 1981. Attacking a baby and having the spell bounce off, isn't
something you'd normally call 'the power to vanquish'. But if you
think of the prophecy as being about <em>several</em> possible
futures, only <em>one</em> of which was actually realized on
Halloween, then the prophecy could already be complete."</p>
<p>"But -" Minerva blurted. "But the raid on Azkaban -"</p>
<p>"<em>If</em> the Dark Lord survived, then sure, he's the most
likely suspect for the Azkaban breakout," Harry said reasonably.
"You could even say that the Azkaban breakout is Bayesian evidence
for the Dark Lord surviving, because an Azkaban breakout is more
likely to happen in worlds where he's alive than worlds where he's
dead. But it's not <em>strong</em> Bayesian evidence. It's not
something that <em>can't possibly happen</em> unless the Dark Lord
is alive. Professor Quirrell, who <em>didn't</em> start from the
assumption that You-Know-Who was still around, had no trouble
thinking of his own explanation. To him, it was obvious that some
powerful wizard might want Bellatrix Black because she knew a
secret of the Dark Lord's, like some of his magical knowledge that
he'd told to only her. The priors against anyone surviving their
body's death are very low, even if it's magically possible.
<em>Most</em> times it doesn't happen. So if it's <em>just</em> the
Azkaban breakout... I'd have to say formally that it isn't enough
Bayesian evidence. The improbability of the evidence assuming that
the hypothesis is false, is not commensurate with the prior
improbability of the hypothesis."</p>
<p>"No," Severus said flatly. "The prophecy is not yet fulfilled. I
would know if it were."</p>
<p>"Are you <em>sure</em> of that?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Potter. If the prophecy had already come true, I would
<em>understand</em> it! I heard Trelawney's words, I remember
Trelawney's voice, and if I knew the events that matched the
prophecy, I would <em>recognize</em> them. What has already
happened... does <em>not</em> fit." The Potions Master spoke with
certainty.</p>
<p>"I'm not really sure what to do with that statement," Harry
said. His hand rose up, absently rubbed at his forehead. "Maybe
it's just what you <em>think</em> happened that doesn't fit, and
the true history is different..."</p>
<p>"Voldemort <em>is</em> alive," Albus said. "There are other
indications."</p>
<p>"Such as?" Harry's reply was instant.</p>
<p>Albus paused. "There are terrible rituals by which wizards have
returned from death," Albus said slowly. "That much, anyone can
discern within history and legend. And yet those books are missing,
I could not find them; it was Voldemort who removed them, I am sure
-"</p>
<p>"So you <em>can't</em> find any books on immortality, and that
proves that You-Know-Who has them?"</p>
<p>"Indeed," said Albus. "There is a certain book - I will not name
it aloud - missing from the Restricted Section of the Hogwarts
library. An ancient scroll which should have been at Borgin and
Burkes, with only an empty place on a shelf to show where it was -"
The old wizard stopped. "But I suppose," the old wizard said, as
though to himself, "you will say that even if Voldemort tried to
make himself immortal, it does not prove that he succeeded..."</p>
<p>Harry sighed. "Proof, Headmaster? There are only ever
probabilities. If there are known, particular books on immortality
rituals which are missing, that increases the probability that
someone attempted one. Which, in turn, raises the prior probability
of the Dark Lord surviving his death. This I concede, and thank you
for contributing the fact. The question is whether the prior
probability goes up <em>enough.</em>"</p>
<p>"Surely," Albus said quietly, "if you concede even a
<em>chance</em> that Voldemort survived, that is worth guarding
against?"</p>
<p>Harry inclined his head. "As you say, Headmaster. Though once a
probability drops low enough, it's also an error to go on obsessing
about it... Given that books on immortality are missing, and that
this prophecy would sound <em>somewhat</em> more natural if it
refers to the Dark Lord and I having a future battle, I agree that
the Dark Lord being alive is a probability, not just possibility.
But other probabilities must <em>also</em> be taken into account -
and in the probable worlds where You-Know-Who is <em>not</em>
alive, someone else framed Hermione."</p>
<p>"Foolishness," Severus said softly. "Utter foolishness. The Dark
Mark has not faded, nor has its master."</p>
<p>"See, <em>that's</em> what I mean by formally insufficient
Bayesian evidence. Sure, it sounds all grim and foreboding and
stuff, but is it <em>that</em> unlikely for a magical mark to stay
around after the maker dies? Suppose the mark is certain to
continue while the Dark Lord's sentience lives on, but <em>a
priori</em> we'd only have guessed a twenty percent chance of the
Dark Mark continuing to exist after the Dark Lord dies. Then the
observation, 'The Dark Mark has not faded' is five times as likely
to occur in worlds where the Dark Lord is alive as in worlds where
the Dark Lord is dead. Is that really commensurate with the prior
improbability of immortality? Let's say the prior odds were a
hundred-to-one against the Dark Lord surviving. If a hypothesis is
a hundred times as likely to be false versus true, and then you see
evidence five times more likely if the hypothesis is true versus
false, you should update to believing the hypothesis is twenty
times as likely to be false as true. Odds of a hundred to one,
times a likelihood ratio of one to five, equals odds of twenty to
one that the Dark Lord is dead -"</p>
<p>"<em>Where</em> are you getting all these numbers, Potter?"</p>
<p>"That <em>is</em> the admitted weakness of the method," Harry
said readily. "But what I'm <em>qualitatively</em> getting at is
why the observation, 'The Dark Mark has not faded', is not adequate
support for the hypothesis, 'The Dark Lord is immortal.' The
evidence isn't as extraordinary as the claim." Harry paused. "Not
to mention that even if the Dark Lord is alive, he doesn't
<em>have</em> to be the one who framed Hermione. As a cunning man
once said, there could be more than one plotter and more than one
plan."</p>
<p>"Such as the Defense Professor," Severus said with a thin smile.
"I suppose I must agree that he is a suspect. It was the Defense
Professor last year, after all; and the year before that, and the
year before <em>that</em>."</p>
<p>Harry's eyes dropped back to the parchment in his lap. "Let's
move on. Are we <em>certain</em> that this Prophecy is accurate?
Nobody messed with Professor McGonagall's memory, maybe edited or
subtracted a line?"</p>
<p>Albus paused, then spoke slowly. "There is a great spell laid
over Britain, recording every prophecy said within our borders. Far
beneath the Most Ancient Hall of the Wizengamot, in the Department
of Mysteries, they are recorded."</p>
<p>"The Hall of Prophecy," Minerva whispered. She'd read about that
place, said to be a great room of shelves filled with glowing orbs,
one after another appearing over the years. Merlin himself had
wrought it, it was said; the greatest wizard's final slap to the
face of Fate. Not all prophecies conduced to the good; and Merlin
had wished for at least those spoken of in prophecy, to know what
had been spoken <em>of</em> them. That was the respect Merlin had
given to their free will, that Destiny might not control them from
the outside, unwitting. Those mentioned within a prophecy would
have an glowing orb float to their hand, and then hear the
prophet's true voice speaking. Others who tried to touch an orb, it
was said, would be driven mad - or possibly just have their heads
explode, the legends were unclear on this point. Whatever Merlin's
original intention, the Unspeakables hadn't let anyone enter in
centuries, so far as she'd heard. <em>Works of the Ancient
Wizards</em> had stated that later Unspeakables had discovered that
tipping off the subjects of prophecies could interfere with seers
releasing whatever temporal pressures they released; and so the
heirs of Merlin had sealed his Hall. It did occur to Minerva to
wonder (now that she'd spent a few months around Mr. Potter) how
anyone could possibly <em>know</em> that; but she also knew better
than to ask Albus, in case Albus tried to tell her. Minerva firmly
believed that you only ought to worry about Time if you were a
clock.</p>
<p>"The Hall of Prophecy," Albus confirmed lowly. "Those who are
spoken of in a prophecy, may listen to that prophecy there. Do you
see the implication, Harry?"</p>
<p>Harry frowned. "Well, I could listen to it, or the Dark Lord...
oh, my <em>parents</em>. Those who had thrice defied him. They were
also mentioned in the prophecy, so they could hear the
recording?"</p>
<p>"If James and Lily heard anything different from what Minerva
reported," Albus said evenly, "they did not say so to me."</p>
<p>"You took James and Lily <em>there?</em> " Minerva said.</p>
<p>"Fawkes can go to many places," Albus said. "Do not mention the
fact."</p>
<p>Harry was staring directly at Albus. "Can <em>I</em> go to this
Department of Mysteries place and hear the recorded prophecy? The
original tone of voice might be helpful, from what I've heard."</p>
<p>Light glinted from the reflection of Albus's half-moon glasses
as the old wizard slowly shook his head. "I think that would be
unwise," Albus said. "For reasons beyond the obvious. It is
dangerous, that place which Merlin made; more dangerous to some
people than others."</p>
<p>"I see," Harry said tonelessly, and looked back down at the
parchment. "I'll take the prophecy as assumed accurate for now. The
next part says that the Dark Lord has marked me as his equal. Any
ideas on what that means exactly?"</p>
<p>"Surely not," said Albus, "that you must imitate his ways, in
any wise."</p>
<p>"I'm not <em>dumb,</em> Headmaster. Muggles have worked out a
thing or two about temporal paradoxes, even if it's all theoretical
to them. I won't throw away my ethics just because a signal from
the future claims it's going to happen, because then that becomes
the only reason why it happened in the first place. Still, what
<em>does</em> it mean?"</p>
<p>"I do not know," said Severus.</p>
<p>"Nor I," she said.</p>
<p>Harry took out his wand, turned it over in his hands, gazing
meditatively at the wood. "Eleven inches, holly, with a core of
phoenix feather," Harry said. "And the phoenix whose tail feather
is in this wand, only ever gave one other, which Mr... what was his
name, Olive-something... made into the core of the Dark Lord's
wand. <em>And</em> I'm a Parselmouth. It seemed like a lot of
coincidence even then. And now I find out there's a prophecy
stating that I'll be the Dark Lord's equal."</p>
<p>Severus's eyes were thoughtful; the Headmaster's gaze,
unreadable.</p>
<p>"Could it be," Minerva said falteringly, "that You-Know-Who -
that Voldemort - transferred some of his own powers to Mr. Potter,
the night he gave him that scar? Not something he intended to do,
surely. Still... I don't see how Mr. Potter could be his
<em>equal,</em> if he had any less magic than the Dark Lord
himself..."</p>
<p>"Meh," said Harry, still looking meditatively at his wand. "I'd
fight the Dark Lord without any magic at all, if I had to. <em>Homo
sapiens</em> didn't become the dominant species on this planet by
having the sharpest claws or hardest armor - though I suppose some
of that point may be lost on wizards. Still, it's beneath my
dignity as a human being to be scared of anything that isn't
smarter than I am; and from what I've heard, on that particular
dimension the Dark Lord wasn't very scary."</p>
<p>The Potions Master spoke, his voice taking on some of his
customary contemptuous drawl. "You imagine yourself more
intelligent than the Dark Lord, Potter?"</p>
<p>"Yes, in fact," said Harry, pulling back the left sleeve of his
robes, and rolling up the shirtsleeve beneath to expose the bare
elbow. "Oh, that reminds me! Let's make sure nobody here has the
clearly visible tattoo in the standard, easily checkable location
which would mark them as a secret enemy spy."</p>
<p>Albus made a quieting gesture that halted the Potions Master
before he could say anything scathing. "Tell me, Harry," Albus
said, "how would <em>you</em> have crafted the Dark Mark?"</p>
<p>"Nonstandard locations," Harry said promptly, "not easily found
without embarrassment and fuss, though of course any
security-conscious person would check anyway. Make it smaller, if
possible. Overlay another non-magical tattoo to obscure the exact
shape - better yet, cover it with a layer of fake skin -"</p>
<p>"Cunning indeed," Albus said. "But tell me, suppose you could
craft any conditions you wished into the Mark, fading it or raising
it as you wished. What would you do then?"</p>
<p>"Make it completely invisible at all times," Harry said in tones
of stating the obvious. "You don't want there to be any detectable
difference between a spy and a non-spy."</p>
<p>"Suppose you are more cunning still," Albus said. "You are a
master of trickery, a master of deception, and you employ your
abilities to the fullest."</p>
<p>"Well -" The boy stopped, frowning. "It seems unnecessarily
complicated, more like a tactic a villain would use in a
role-playing game than something you'd try in a real-life war. But
I suppose you could put fake Dark Marks on people who aren't really
Death Eaters, and keep the Dark Marks on the real Death Eaters
invisible. But then there's the question of why people would start
believing in the first place that the Dark Mark identified a Death
Eater... I'd have to think about it for at least five minutes, if I
were going to take the problem seriously."</p>
<p>"I ask you this," Albus said, still in that mild tone, "because
I did indeed, in the early days of the war, perform such tests as
you suggested. The Order survived my folly only because Alastor did
not trust in the bare arms we saw. I had thought, afterward, that
the bearers of the Mark might hide it or show it at their will. And
yet when we hied Igor Karkaroff before the Wizengamot, that Mark
showed clear on his arm, for all that Karkaroff wished to protest
his innocence. What true rule may govern the Dark Mark, I do not
know. Even Severus is still bound by his Mark not to reveal its
secrets to any who do not know them."</p>
<p>"Oh, well <em>that</em> makes it <em>obvious</em>," Harry said
promptly. "Wait, hold on - you were a <em>Death Eater?</em> " Harry
transferred his stare to Severus.</p>
<p>Severus returned a thin smile. "I still am, so far as they
know."</p>
<p>"Harry," said Albus, eyes only for the boy. "What do you mean,
that makes it obvious?"</p>
<p>"Information theory 101," the boy said in a lecturing tone.
"Observing variable X conveys information about variable Y, if and
only if the possible values of X have different probabilities given
different states of Y. The instant you hear about anything
whatsoever that varies between a spy and a nonspy, you should
immediately think of exploiting it to distinguish spies from
nonspies. Similarly, to distinguish reality from lies, you need a
process which behaves differently in the presence of truth and
falsehood - that's why 'faith' doesn't work as a discriminant,
while 'make experimental predictions and test them' does. You say
someone with the Dark Mark can't reveal its secrets to anyone who
doesn't already know them. So to find out how the Dark Mark
operates, write down every way you can imagine the Dark Mark
<em>might</em> work, then watch Professor Snape try to tell each of
those things to a confederate - maybe one who doesn't know what the
experiment is about - I'll explain binary search later so that you
can play Twenty Questions to narrow things down - and whatever he
<em>can't</em> say out loud is true. His silence would be something
that behaves differently in the presence of true statements about
the Mark, versus false statements, you see."</p>
<p>Minerva's mouth was hanging open, she realized; and she closed
it abruptly. Even Albus looked surprised.</p>
<p>"And after that, like I said, <em>any</em> behavioral difference
between spies and nonspies can be used to identify spies. Once
you've identified at least one magically censored secret of the
Dark Mark, you can test someone for the Dark Mark by seeing if they
can reveal that secret to somebody who doesn't already know it
-"</p>
<p><em>"Thank you, Mr. Potter."</em></p>
<p>Everyone looked at Severus. The Potions Master was
straightening, his teeth bared in a grimace of angry triumph.
"Headmaster, I can now speak freely of the Mark. If we know we are
caught for a Death Eater, before others who have not yet seen our
bare arms, our Mark reveals itself whether we will it or no. But if
they have already seen our arms bare, it does not reveal itself;
nor if we are only being tested from suspicion. Thus the Dark Mark
seems to identify Death Eaters - but only those already found, you
perceive."</p>
<p>"Ah..." Albus said. "Thank you, Severus." He closed his eyes
briefly. "That would indeed explain why Black escaped even Peter's
notice... ah, well. And Harry's proposed test?"</p>
<p>The Potions Master shook his head. "The Dark Lord was no fool,
despite Potter's delusions. The moment such a test is suspected,
the Mark ceases to bind our tongues. Yet I could not hint at the
possibility, but only wait for another to deduce it." Another thin
smile. "I would award you a good many House points, Mr. Potter, if
it would not compromise my cover. But as you can see, the Dark Lord
was quite cunning." His gaze grew more distant. "Oh," Severus
breathed, "he was <em>very</em> cunning indeed..."</p>
<p>Harry Potter sat still for a long moment.</p>
<p>Then -</p>
<p>"No," Harry said. The boy shook his head. "No, that can't
<em>actually</em> be true. First of all, we're talking about the
kind of logic puzzle that would appear in chapter <em>one</em> of a
Raymond Smullyan book, nowhere <em>near</em> the level of what
Muggle scientists do for a living. And second, for all I know, it
took the Dark Lord five months of thinking to invent the puzzle I
just solved in five seconds -"</p>
<p>"Is it <em>that</em> inconceivable to you, Potter, that anyone
could be so intelligent as yourself?" The Potions Master's voice
held more curiosity than scorn.</p>
<p>"It's called a base rate, Professor Snape. The evidence is
equally compatible with the Dark Lord inventing that puzzle over
the course of five months or over the course of five seconds, but
in any given population there'll be many more people who can do it
in five months than in five seconds..." Harry pasted a hand against
his forehead. "Darn it, how can I explain this? I suppose, from
your perspective, the Dark Lord came up with a clever puzzle and I
cleverly solved it and that makes us look <em>equal</em>."</p>
<p>"I remember your first day of Potions class," the Potions Master
said dryly. "I think you have a ways still to go."</p>
<p>"Peace, Severus," Albus said. "Harry has already accomplished
more than you know. Yet tell me, Harry - why <em>do</em> you
believe the Dark Lord is less than you? Surely he is a damaged soul
in many ways. But cunning for cunning - you are not yet ready to
face him, I would judge; and I know the full tally of your
deeds."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The frustrating thing about this conversation was that Harry
<em>couldn't say his actual reasons for disagreeing,</em> which
violated several basic principles of cooperative discourse.</p>
<p>He couldn't explain how Bellatrix had really been removed from
Azkaban - not by You-Know-Who in any guise, but by the combined
wits of Harry and Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>Harry didn't want to say in front of Professor McGonagall that
the existence of brain damage implied that there were no such
things as souls. Which made a successful immortality ritual...
well, not <em>impossible,</em> Harry certainly intended to forge a
road to magical immortality <em>someday</em>, but it would be a
<em>lot harder</em> and require <em>much more ingenuity</em> than
just binding an already-existent soul to a lich's phylactery. Which
no intelligent wizard would bother doing in the first place, if
they knew their souls were immortal.</p>
<p>And the true and honest reason Harry knew the Dark Lord couldn't
have been <em>that</em> smart... well... there wasn't any tactful
way to say it, but...</p>
<p>Harry had <em>been</em> to a convocation of the Wizengamot. He'd
<em>seen</em> the laughable 'security precautions', if you could
call them that, guarding the deepest levels of the Ministry of
Magic. They didn't even have the Thief's Downfall which goblins
used to wash away Polyjuice and Imperius Curses on people entering
Gringotts. The obvious takeover route would be to Imperius the
Minister of Magic and a few department heads, and owl a hand
grenade to anyone too powerful to Imperius. Or owl them knockout
gas, if you needed them alive and in a state of Living Death to
take hairs for Polyjuice potions. Legilimency, False Memories, the
Confundus Charm - it was ridiculous, the magical world was
<em>supersaturated</em> with ways to cheat. Harry might not do any
of those things himself, during his own takeover of Britain, since
he was constrained by Ethics... well, Harry <em>might</em> do some
of the lesser ones, since Polyjuice or a temporary Confundus or
read-only Legilimency all sounded better than an extra day of
Azkaban... but...</p>
<p>If Harry hadn't been constrained by Ethics, it was possible he
could've wiped out the eviller sections of the Wizengamot that day;
all by himself, using only a first-year's magical power, on account
of being clever enough to figure out Dementors. Though Harry might
not have been in such a great political position after that, the
surviving Wizengamot members might've found it easy and cheap to
disavow his actions for P.R. purposes and condemn him, even if the
smarter ones realized it was for the greater good... but
<em>still.</em></p>
<p>If you were completely unrestrained by ethics, armed with the
ancient secrets of Salazar Slytherin, had dozens of powerful
followers including Lucius Malfoy, and it took you more than ten
years to <em>fail</em> to overthrow the government of magical
Britain, it meant you were stupid.</p>
<p>"How can I put this..." Harry said. "Look, Headmaster, you've
got ethics, there's a lot of battle tactics you don't use because
you're not evil. And you fought the Dark Lord, a tremendously
powerful wizard who wasn't so restrained, and you held him off
<em>anyway</em>. If You-Know-Who had been super-smart <em>on top of
that</em>, you'd be <em>dead.</em> <em>All</em> of you. You'd have
died <em>instantly -</em>"</p>
<p>"Harry," Professor McGonagall said. Her voice was faltering.
"Harry, we almost <em>did</em> all die. More than half the Order of
the Phoenix died. If not for Albus - Albus Dumbledore, the greatest
wizard in two centuries, Harry - we surely would have
perished."</p>
<p>Harry passed a hand across his forehead. "I'm sorry," Harry
said. "I'm not trying to minimize what you went through. I know
that You-Know-Who was a completely evil, incredibly powerful Dark
Wizard with dozens of powerful followers, and that's... bad, yes,
definitely bad. It's just..." <em>All that isn't on remotely the
same threat scale as the enemy being smart, in which case they
Transfigure botulinum toxin and sneak a millionth of a gram into
your teacup.</em> Was there any safe way to convey that concept
without citing specifics? Harry couldn't think of one.</p>
<p>"Please, Harry," said Professor McGonagall. "Please, Harry, I
beg you - <em>take the Dark Lord seriously!</em> He is more
dangerous than -" The senior witch seemed to be having trouble
finding words. "He is <em>far</em> more dangerous than
Transfiguration."</p>
<p>Harry's eyebrows went up before he could stop himself. A dark
chuckle came from Severus Snape's direction.</p>
<p><em>Um,</em> said the voice of Ravenclaw within him. <em>Um,
honestly Professor McGonagall is right, we're not taking this as
seriously as we'd take a scientific problem. The difficult thing is
to react</em> at all <em>to new information, instead of just
flushing it out the window. Right now it looks like we didn't shift
belief</em> at all <em>after encountering an unexpected, important
argument. Our dismissal of Lord Voldemort as a serious threat</em>
was <em>originally based on the Dark Mark being blatantly stupid.
It would require a focused effort to de-update and suspect the
whole garden-path of reasoning we went down based on that false
assumption, and we're</em> not <em>putting in that effort right
now.</em></p>
<p>"All right," Harry said, just as Professor McGonagall seemed to
be about to speak again. "All right, to take this seriously, I need
to stop and think for five minutes."</p>
<p>"Please do," said Albus Dumbledore.</p>
<p>Harry closed his eyes.</p>
<p>His Ravenclaw side divided into three.</p>
<p><em>Probability estimate,</em> said Ravenclaw One, who was
acting as moderator. <em>That the Dark Lord is alive, and as smart
as we are, and hence a genuine threat.</em></p>
<p><em>Why aren't all his enemies already dead?</em> said Ravenclaw
Two, who was prosecuting.</p>
<p><em>Note,</em> said Ravenclaw One, <em>we had already thought of
that argument so we can't use it to shift belief</em> again
<em>each time we rehearse it.</em></p>
<p><em>But what's the actual flaw in the logic?</em> said Ravenclaw
Two. <em>In worlds with a smart Lord Voldemort, everyone in the
Order of the Phoenix died in the first five minutes of the war. The
world doesn't look like that, so we don't live in that world.
QED.</em></p>
<p><em>Is that really certain?</em> asked Ravenclaw Three, who'd
been appointed as the defender. <em>Maybe there was some reason
Lord Voldemort</em> wasn't <em>fighting all-out back then
-</em></p>
<p><em>Like what?</em> demanded Ravenclaw Two. <em>Furthermore,
whatever your excuse, I demand that the probability of your
hypothesis be penalized in accordance with its added complexity
-</em></p>
<p><em>Let Three talk,</em> said Ravenclaw One.</p>
<p><em>Okay... look,</em> said Ravenclaw Three. <em>First of all,
we don't</em> know <em>that anyone can take over the Ministry just
with mind control. Maybe magical Britain is really an oligarchy and
you need enough military power to intimidate the family heads into
submission -</em></p>
<p><em>Imperius them too,</em> interjected Ravenclaw Two.</p>
<p><em>- and the oligarchs have Thief's Downfall in the entrances
to</em> their <em>homes -</em></p>
<p><em>Complexity penalty!</em> cried Ravenclaw Two. <em>More
epicycles!</em></p>
<p>- <em>oh, be reasonable,</em> said Ravenclaw Three. <em>We
haven't actually</em> seen <em>anyone taking over the Ministry with
a couple of well-placed Imperius curses. We don't</em> know
<em>that it can actually be done that easily.</em></p>
<p><em>But,</em> said Ravenclaw Two, <em>even taking that into
account... it really seems like there should've been</em> some
<em>other way. Ten years of failure, really? Using only
conventional terrorist tactics? That's just... not even</em>
trying.</p>
<p><em>Maybe Lord Voldemort did have more creative ideas,</em>
replied Ravenclaw Three, <em>but he didn't want to tip his hand
to</em> other <em>countries' governments, didn't want</em> them
<em>to know how vulnerable they were and install Thief's Downfall
in</em> their <em>Ministries. Not until he had Britain as a base
and enough servants to subvert</em> all <em>the other major
governments simultaneously.</em></p>
<p><em>You're assuming he wants to conquer the whole world,</em>
noted Ravenclaw Two.</p>
<p><em>Trelawney prophesized that he would be our equal,</em>
intoned Ravenclaw Three solemnly. <em>Therefore, he wanted to take
over the world.</em></p>
<p><em>And if he is your equal, and you do have to fight him
-</em></p>
<p>For an instant, Harry's mind tried to imagine the specter of two
<em>creative</em> wizards fighting an all-out-war against each
other.</p>
<p>Harry had noted all the Charms and Potions in his first-year
books that could be creatively used to kill people. He hadn't been
able to help himself. Literally. He'd <em>tried</em> to stop his
brain from doing it each time, but it was like looking at a fish
and trying to stop your brain from noticing it was a fish. What
someone could creatively do with seventh-year, or Auror-level, or
ancient lost magic such as Lord Voldemort had possessed... didn't
bear thinking about. A magically-superpowered creative-genius
psychopath wasn't a 'threat', it was an extinction event.</p>
<p>Then Harry shook his head, dismissing the gloomy line his
reasoning had been going down. The question was whether there was a
significant probability of facing anything so terrible as a Dark
Rationalist in the first place.</p>
<p><em>Prior odds that someone attempting an immortality ritual
would actually have it work...</em></p>
<p>Call it one to a thousand, at a generous overestimate; it was
not the case that roughly one wizard in a thousand survived their
death. Though, admittedly Harry didn't have data on how many had
attempted immortality rituals first.</p>
<p><em>What if the Dark Lord</em> is <em>as smart as us?</em> said
Ravenclaw Three. <em>You know, the way Trelawney prophesied him
being our</em> equal. <em>Then he would</em> make <em>his
immortality ritual work.</em> <em>P.S., don't forget that 'destroy
all but a remnant of the other' line.</em></p>
<p>Requiring that level of intelligence was an additional
burdensome detail; prior odds of a random population member being
that intelligent were low...</p>
<p>But Lord Voldemort wasn't a randomly selected wizard, he was one
particular wizard in the population who'd come to everyone's
attention. The puzzle of the Mark implied a certain minimum level
of intelligence, even if (hypothetically) the Dark Lord had taken
longer to think it through. Then again, in the Muggle world, all of
the extremely intelligent people Harry knew about from history had
<em>not</em> become evil dictators or terrorists. The closest thing
to that in the Muggle world was hedge-fund managers, and none of
<em>them</em> had tried to take over so much as a third-world
country, a point which put upper bounds on both their possible evil
and possible goodness.</p>
<p>There were hypotheses where the Dark Lord was smart and the
Order of the Phoenix <em>didn't</em> just instantly die, but those
hypotheses were more complicated and ought to get complexity
penalties. After the complexity penalties of the further excuses
were factored in, there would be a large likelihood ratio from the
hypotheses 'The Dark Lord is smart' versus 'The Dark Lord was
stupid' to the observation, 'The Dark Lord did not instantly win
the war'. That was probably worth a 10:1 likelihood ratio in favor
of the Dark Lord being stupid... but maybe not 100:1. You couldn't
actually say that 'The Dark Lord instantly wins' had a probability
of <em>more</em> than 99 percent, assuming the Dark Lord started
out smart; the sum over all possible excuses would be more than
.01.</p>
<p>And then there was the Prophecy... which might or might not have
<em>originally</em> included a line about how Lord Voldemort would
<em>immediately</em> die if he confronted the Potters. Which Albus
Dumbledore had then edited in Professor McGonagall's memory, in
order to lure Lord Voldemort to his doom. If there <em>was</em> no
such line, the Prophecy did sound <em>somewhat</em> more like
You-Know-Who and the Boy-Who-Lived were destined to have some later
confrontation. But in <em>that</em> case, it was less likely that
Dumbledore would've come up with a plausible-sounding excuse not to
take Harry to the Hall of Prophecy...</p>
<p>Harry was wondering if he could even <em>get</em> a Bayesian
calculation out of this. Of course, the point of a subjective
Bayesian calculation wasn't that, after you made up a bunch of
numbers, multiplying them out would give you an exactly right
answer. The real point was that the <em>process</em> of making up
numbers would force you to tally all the relevant facts and weigh
all the relative probabilities. Like realizing, as soon as you
actually <em>thought</em> about the probability of the Dark Mark
not-fading <em>if</em> You-Know-Who <em>was</em> dead, that the
probability wasn't low enough for the observation to count as
strong evidence. One version of the process was to tally hypotheses
and list out evidence, make up all the numbers, do the calculation,
and then throw out the final answer and go with your brain's gut
feeling <em>after</em> you'd forced it to really <em>weigh</em>
everything. The trouble was that the items of evidence weren't
conditionally independent, and there were multiple interacting
background facts of interest...</p>
<p>...well, <em>one</em> thing at least was certain.</p>
<p>If the calculation could be done at all, it was going to take a
piece of paper and a pencil.</p>
<p>In the fireplace at one side of the Headmaster's office, the
flames suddenly flared up, turning from orange to bright billious
green.</p>
<p>"Ah!" said Professor McGonagall into the uncomfortable
non-silence. "That would be Mad-Eye Moody, I suppose."</p>
<p>"Let this matter bide for now," the Headmaster said in some
relief, as he too turned to regard the Floo. "I believe we are
about to receive some news regarding it, as well."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Hypothesis: Hermione Granger</em><br>
<em>(April 8th, 1992, 6:53pm)</em></p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Meanwhile in the Great Hall of Hogwarts, as the students who
didn't have secret meetings with the Headmaster bustled about their
dinner around four huge tables -</p>
<p>"It's funny," Dean Thomas said thoughtfully. "I didn't believe
the General when he said that what we learned would change us
forever, and we'd never be able to return to a normal life
afterward. Once we knew. Once we saw what <em>he</em> could
see."</p>
<p>"I know!" said Seamus Finnigan. "I thought it was just a joke
too! Like, you know, everything else General Chaos ever said
ever."</p>
<p>"But now -" Dean said sadly. "We <em>can't</em> go back, can we?
It'd be like going back to a Muggle school after having been to
Hogwarts. We've just... we've just got to stay around each other.
That's all we can do, or we'll go crazy."</p>
<p>Seamus Finnigan, next to him, just nodded wordlessly and ate
another bite of veldbeest.</p>
<p>Around them, the conversation at the Gryffindor table continued.
It wasn't as <em>relentless</em> as it'd been yesterday, but now
and then the topic wandered back.</p>
<p>"Well, there must've been <em>some</em> sort of love triangle,"
said a second-year witch named Samantha Crowley (she never answered
when asked if there was any relation). "The question is, which ways
was it <em>going</em> before it all went wrong? Who was in love
with who - and whether or not that person loved them back - I don't
know <em>how</em> many possibilities there are -"</p>
<p>"Sixty-four," said Sarah Varyabil, a blossoming beauty who
probably should've been Sorted into Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff
instead. "No, wait, that's wrong. I mean, if nobody loved Malfoy
and Malfoy didn't love anyone then he wouldn't really be part of
the love triangle... this is going to take Arithmancy, could you
all wait two minutes?"</p>
<p>"<em>I,</em> for one, think it perfectly clear that Granger is
Potter's moirail, and that Potter was auspisticing between Malfoy
and Granger." The witch who'd spoken nodded with the
self-satisfaction of someone who has just precisely nailed down a
complicated issue.</p>
<p>"Those aren't even words," objected a young wizard. "You're just
making them up as you go."</p>
<p>"Sometimes you can't describe a thing using <em>real</em>
words."</p>
<p>"It's so <em>sad,</em>" said Sherice Ngaserin, who actually had
tears in her eyes. "They were just - they were just so
<em>obviously</em> meant to be together!"</p>
<p>"You mean Potter and Malfoy?" said a second-year named Colleen
Johnson. "I know - their families hated each other so much, there's
no way they <em>couldn't</em> fall in love -"</p>
<p>"No, I mean all three of them," said Sherice.</p>
<p>This produced a brief pause in the huddled conversation. Dean
Thomas was quietly choking on his lemonade, trying not to make any
sounds as it trickled out of his mouth and soaked into his
shirt.</p>
<p>"<em>Wow,</em>" said a dark-haired witch by the name of Nancy
Hua. "That's really... <em>sophisticated</em> of you, Sherice."</p>
<p>"Look, you all, we need to keep this realistic," said Eloise
Rosen, a tall witch who'd been General of an army and hence spoke
with an air of authority. "We <em>know</em> - because she kissed
him - that Granger was in love with Potter. So the only reason
she'd try to kill Malfoy is if she knew that she was losing Potter
to him. There's no need to make it all sound so complicated -
you're all acting like this is a play instead of real life!"</p>
<p>"But even if Granger was in love, it's still funny that she'd
just <em>snap</em> like that," said Chloe, whose black robes
combined with her night-black skin to make her look like a darkened
silhouette. "I don't know... I think maybe there's more to this
than just a romance novel gone wrong. I think maybe most people
haven't got any idea at all what's going on."</p>
<p>"<em>Yes! Thank you!</em> " burst out Dean Thomas. "Look - don't
you realize - like Harry Potter <em>told</em> us all - if you
didn't <em>predict</em> that something would happen, if it took you
completely by surprise, then what you believed about the world when
you <em>didn't</em> see it coming, isn't enough to explain..."
Dean's voice trailed off, as he saw that nobody was listening.
"It's <em>completely hopeless,</em> isn't it?"</p>
<p>"You hadn't figured that out yet?" said Lavender Brown, who was
sitting across the table from her two fellow former Chaotics.
"How'd you ever make Lieutenant?"</p>
<p>"Oh, you two be quiet!" Sherice snapped at them. "It's obvious
you both want the three of them for yourselves!"</p>
<p>"I mean it!" Chloe said. "What if what's <em>really</em> going
on is different from all the, you know, <em>normal</em> things that
all the <em>ordinary</em> people are talking about? What if
somebody - <em>made</em> Granger do what she did, just like Potter
was trying to tell everyone?"</p>
<p>"I think Chloe's right," said a foreign-looking boy wizard who
always introduced himself as 'Adrian Turnipseed', though his
parents had actually named him Mad Drongo. "I think this whole time
there's been..." Adrian lowered his voice ominously, "...a
<em>hidden hand</em>..." Adrian raised his voice again, "shaping
all that's happened. One person who's been behind
<em>everything,</em> from the beginning. And I don't mean Professor
Snape, either."</p>
<p>"You don't mean -" gasped Sarah.</p>
<p>"Yes," Adrian said. "The <em>real</em> one behind it all is -
<em>Tracey Davis!</em> "</p>
<p>"That's what I think too," Chloe said. "After all -" She glanced
around rapidly. "Ever since that thing with the bullies and the
ceiling - even the trees in the forests around Hogwarts look like
they're <em>shaking,</em> like they're <em>afraid -</em>"</p>
<p>Seamus Finnigan was frowning thoughtfully. "I think I see where
Harry gets his... <em>you know...</em> from," Seamus said, lowering
his voice so that only Lavender and Dean could hear.</p>
<p>"Oh, I totally know what you mean," Lavender said. She didn't
bother to lower her own voice. "It's a wonder he didn't crack and
just start killing everyone <em>ages</em> ago."</p>
<p>"Personally," Dean said, also in a quieter voice, "I'd say the
really scary part is - that could've been <em>us.</em>"</p>
<p>"Yeah," said Lavender. "It's a good thing <em>we're</em> all
perfectly sane now."</p>
<p>Dean and Seamus nodded solemnly.</p>

<p><em>Hypothesis: G. L.<br>
<em>(April 8th, 1992, 8:08pm)</em></em></p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The Floo-Fire of the Headmaster's office blazed a bright
pale-green, the fire concentrating in on itself into a spinning
emeraldine whirlwind, and then flared even brighter and spit a
human figure into the air -</p>
<p>There was a blur of motion as the resolving figure snapped up a
wand, smoothly spinning with the Floo's momentum like a ballet
dance step, so that his firing arc covered the entire 360-degree
arc of the room; and then just as abruptly, the figure stopped in
place.</p>
<p>In the first instant that Harry saw that man, before Harry even
took in the eye, he noticed the scars on the hands, the scars on
the face, like the man had been burned and cut over his entire
body; though only the man's hands and face were visible, of all his
flesh. The rest of the man's body was hidden, encased not in robes,
but in leather that looked more like armor than clothing; dark gray
leather, matching the man's mess of grayed hair.</p>
<p>The next thing that Harry's vision comprehended was the
brilliant blue eye occupying the right side of the man's face.</p>
<p>One part of Harry's mind realized that the person whom Professor
McGonagall had named 'Mad-Eye Moody' was the same as the one
Dumbledore had called 'Alastor', within the memory Dumbledore had
shown Harry; an image from before whatever event had scarred every
inch of the man's body and taken a chunk out of his nose -</p>
<p>And another part of his mind noticed the jolt of adrenaline.
Harry had drawn his wand in sheer reflex when the man had spun out
of the Floo like that, there'd been something about it that felt
like <em>ambush,</em> Harry's hand had already started to level his
wand for a <em>Somnium</em> before he'd managed to stop himself.
Even now the armored man was holding his wand level, not pointed at
any particular person but covering the whole room, and that wand
was already in perfect line with his eyes, like a soldier sighting
down a gun. There was danger in the man's stance and the set of his
boots, danger in the leather armor he wore and danger in that
brilliant blue eye.</p>
<p>When the scarred man spoke, addressing the Headmaster, his voice
was edged. "I suppose you think this room is secure?"</p>
<p>"There are only friends here," Dumbledore said.</p>
<p>The man's head jerked toward Harry. "That include
<em>him?</em> "</p>
<p>"If Harry Potter is not our friend," Dumbledore said gravely,
"then we are all certainly doomed; so we may as well assume that he
is."</p>
<p>The man's wand stayed level, not quite pointing at Harry. "Boy
almost drew on me just then."</p>
<p>"Er..." Harry said. He noticed that his hand was still tightly
holding the wand, and consciously relaxed his hand and dropped it
back to his side. "Sorry about that, you looked a bit...
combat-ready."</p>
<p>The scarred man's wand moved slightly away from where it had
almost pointed at Harry, though it didn't lower, and the man let
out a short bark of laughter. "Constant vigilance, eh, lad?" said
the man.</p>
<p>"It's not paranoia if they really are out to get you," Harry
recited the proverb.</p>
<p>The man turned fully toward Harry; and insofar as Harry could
read any expression on the scarred face, the man now looked
<em>interested</em>.</p>
<p>Dumbledore's eyes had regained some of the brilliant twinkle
that they'd had before the Azkaban breakout, a smile beneath his
silver mustache as though that smile had never left. "Harry, this
is Alastor Moody, called also Mad-Eye, who will command the Order
of the Phoenix after me - if anything should happen to me, that is.
Alastor, this is Harry Potter. I have every hope the two of you
shall get along <em>fantastically</em>."</p>
<p>"I've heard a good deal about you, boy," said Mad-Eye Moody. His
one dark natural eye stayed fixed on Harry, while the point of
brilliant blue spun frantically, seeming to rotate all the way
around within its socket. "Not all of it good. Heard they're
calling you the Dementor Spooker, in the Department."</p>
<p>After some consideration, Harry decided to reply with a knowing
smile.</p>
<p>"How'd you pull off that one, boy?" the man said softly. Now his
blue eye was fixed on Harry as well. "I had a little chat with one
of the Aurors who escorted the Dementor there from Azkaban. Beth
Martin said it came straight from the pit, and no-one gave it any
special instructions along the way. Of course, she could be
lying."</p>
<p>"There wasn't any sneaky trick to that one," Harry said. "I just
did it the hard way. Of course, I could also be lying."</p>
<p>Dumbledore was leaning back in his chair, chuckling in the
background, like he was just another device in the Headmaster's
Office and that was the sound he made.</p>
<p>The scarred man turned back to face the Headmaster, though his
wand stayed pointed low and in Harry's general direction. When he
spoke his voice was gruff and businesslike. "I have a lead on a
recent host of Voldie's. You're certain his shade is in Hogwarts
now?"</p>
<p>"Not <em>certain</em> -" Dumbledore began.</p>
<p>"Say <em>what?</em> " Harry interrupted. After having nearly
concluded that the Dark Lord didn't exist, it was a shock to hear
it being discussed that matter-of-factly.</p>
<p>"Voldie's host," Moody said shortly. "The one he possessed
before he took over Granger."</p>
<p>"If the tales speak true," Dumbledore said, "there is some
device of power which binds Voldemort's shade to this world; and by
that means he may bargain with a host for possession of their body,
conferring on them some portion of his power and his pride -"</p>
<p>"So the obvious question is who's gained too much power too
quickly," Moody said abruptly. "And it turns out that there's a
fellow who's gone and banished the Bandon Banshee, staked an entire
rogue vampire clan in Asia, tracked down the Wagga-Wagga Werewolf,
and exterminated a pack of ghouls using a tea-strainer.
<em>And</em> he's milking it for all it's worth; there's been talk
of the Order of Merlin. Seems to have turned into a charmer and a
politician, not just a powerful wizard."</p>
<p>"Dear me," murmured Dumbledore. "Are you certain that he is not
relying on his own skills?"</p>
<p>"Checked his grades," Moody said. "Record shows Gilderoy
Lockhart received a Troll in his Defense O.W.L.S., didn't bother
with the N.E.W.T. Just the sort of sucker to take the deal Voldie
was offering." The blue eye whirled crazily within its socket.
"Unless you remember Lockhart as a student, and think he had enough
potential to do all that by himself?"</p>
<p>"No," said Professor McGonagall. She frowned. "Not a chance, I
should say."</p>
<p>"I fear I must agree," Dumbledore said with an undertone of
pain. "Ah, Gilderoy, you poor fool..."</p>
<p>Moody's grin was more like a snarl. "Three in the morning work
for you, Albus? Lockhart should be at his home tonight."</p>
<p>Harry listened to this with increasing alarm, wondering if even
the <em>Ministry</em> had any rules about magistrates needing to
issue warrants - never mind the illegal vigilante organization
Harry now seemed to have joined. "Excuse me," Harry said. "What
<em>exactly</em> happens at three in the morning?"</p>
<p>There must have been something in Harry's voice that gave him
away, because the scarred man whirled on him. "You have a problem
with that, boy?"</p>
<p>Harry paused, trying to figure out how to phrase this to the
stranger -</p>
<p>"You want to take him down yourself?" pressed the scarred man.
"Get revenge for your parents, eh?"</p>
<p>"No," Harry said as politely he could. "Honestly - look, if we
knew for <em>certain</em> he was a willing host for You-Know-Who,
that's one thing, but if we're <em>not</em> sure and you're heading
off to kill him -"</p>
<p>"Kill?" Mad-Eye Moody snorted. "It's what's locked up in his
head," Moody tapped his forehead, "that we need from him, boy. If
we're lucky, Voldie can't wipe the sucker's memories as easy as in
his living days, and Lockhart will remember what the horcrux looked
like."</p>
<p>Harry mentally noted down the word <em>horcrux</em> for future
research, and said, "I'm just worried that someone innocent - what
sounds like a pretty decent person, if he <em>did</em> do all that
himself - might be about to get hurt."</p>
<p>"Aurors hurt people," the scarred man said shortly. "Bad people,
if you're lucky. Some days you won't be lucky, and that's all there
is to it. Just remember, Dark Wizards hurt a lot more people than
we do."</p>
<p>Harry took a deep breath. "Can you at least <em>try</em> not to
hurt this person, in case he's <em>not -</em>"</p>
<p>"What is a first-year doing in this room, Albus?" demanded the
scarred man, now whirling to face the Headmaster. "And don't tell
me it's for what he did when he was a baby."</p>
<p>"Harry Potter is not an ordinary first-year," the Headmaster
said quietly. "He has already accomplished feats impossible enough
to shock even me, Alastor. His is the only intellect in the Order
which might someday match that of Voldemort himself, as you or I
never could."</p>
<p>The scarred man leaned over the Headmaster's desk. "He's a
liability. Naive. Doesn't know a bloody thing about what war's
like. I want him out of here and all his memories of the Order
wiped before one of Voldie's servants plucks them straight out of
his mind -"</p>
<p>"I'm an Occlumens, actually."</p>
<p>Mad-Eye Moody directed a narrow look at the Headmaster, who
nodded.</p>
<p>And then the scarred man turned to face Harry, their gazes
meeting.</p>
<p>The sudden fury of the Legilimency attack almost made Harry fall
off his chair, as a blade of white-hot steel cut into the imaginary
person at the forefront of his mind. Harry hadn't had a chance to
practice since Mr. Bester's training, and Harry very nearly lost
his grip on the imaginary person the back-of-his-mind was
pretending to be, as that person's world turned into searing lava
and a furious probe of questions. Harry almost lost his grip on
only <em>pretending</em> to hallucinate, only <em>pretending</em>
to be the imaginary person that was screaming in shock and pain as
the Legilimency tore apart his sanity and reshaped him to believe
that he was on fire -</p>
<p>Harry managed to break eye contact, dropping his eyes to Moody's
chin.</p>
<p>"You're out of practice, boy," Moody said. Harry wasn't looking
at the man's face, but his voice was deadly grim. "And I'll warn
you of this but once. Voldie isn't like any other Legilimens in
recorded history. He doesn't need to look you in the eyes, and if
your shields are that rusty he'd creep in so softly you'd never
notice a thing."</p>
<p>"Duly noted," Harry said to the scarred chin. Harry was more
shaken than he'd have admitted; Mr. Bester hadn't been anywhere
near that powerful, and had never tested Harry like <em>that</em>.
Pretending to be someone hurting that much had... Harry couldn't
find words for describing what it felt like to contain an imaginary
person in that much pain, but it hadn't been <em>normal</em>. "Do I
get any credit for being an Occlumens in the first place?"</p>
<p>"So you're think you're all grown up already, eh? Look me in the
eyes!"</p>
<p>Harry strengthened his shields, and looked once more into the
dark grey eye and the brilliant blue.</p>
<p>"Ever watched someone die?" asked Mad-Eye Moody.</p>
<p>"My parents," Harry said evenly. "I recovered the memory in
January when I went in front of a Dementor to learn the Patronus
Charm. I remember You-Know-Who's voice -" A chill went through
Harry's body, his wand twitching in his hand. "My main tactical
report is that You-Know-Who could speak the Killing Curse in less
than half a second, but you probably already knew that."</p>
<p>There was a gasp from Professor McGonagall's direction, and
Severus's face had tightened.</p>
<p>"All right," Mad-Eye Moody said softly. A strange, thin grin
twisted up the lips within the scarred face. "I'll make you the
same offer I'd make to any trainee Auror. Land one touch on me, boy
- one hit, one spell - and I'll concede your right to talk back to
me."</p>
<p>"Alastor!" exclaimed Professor McGonagall's voice. "Surely
that's an unreasonable test! Mr. Potter, whatever his other merits,
does not have a hundred years of fighting experience!"</p>
<p>Harry's eyes made a lightning dart around the room, passing over
the peculiar devices, glancing past Dumbledore and Severus and the
Sorting Hat, settling briefly here and there. Harry couldn't see
Professor McGonagall from where he was, but that didn't matter.
There was only one device he'd really wanted to look at, and the
point of all the other glances had just been to conceal which
one.</p>
<p>"All righty," Harry said, and hopped off his chair, ignoring
Professor McGonagall's inhalation and the Potions Master's snort of
disbelief. Dumbledore's eyebrows had lifted, and Moody was grinning
like a tiger. "Be sure to wake me up in forty minutes if he does
get me." Harry settled into a duelist's starting stance, his wand
held low. "Let's go, then -"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry opened his eyes, his head feeling like it had been stuffed
with cotton wool.</p>
<p>Everyone else was gone from the Headmaster's office, the
Floo-Fire dimmed; only Dumbledore still waited behind the desk.</p>
<p>"Hello, Harry," the Headmaster said quietly.</p>
<p>"I didn't even see him <em>move,</em>" Harry marvelled, muscles
creaking as he sat up.</p>
<p>"You were standing two paces away from Alastor Moody," said
Dumbledore, "and you took your eye off his wand."</p>
<p>Harry nodded, as he took the Cloak of Invisibility out of his
pouch. "I mean - I was taking the dueling stance so that he'd think
I was a standard idiot and underestimate me - but I have to admit,
<em>that</em> was impressive."</p>
<p>"So you planned it all along, Harry?" Dumbledore said.</p>
<p>"Of course," Harry said. "Note how I'm doing this as soon as I
wake up, rather than pausing to think of it."</p>
<p>Harry drew the hood of the Cloak over his head, and glanced back
up at the wall clock he'd surreptitiously glanced at earlier.</p>
<p>It had then shown around twenty-three minutes after eight, and
now it was five minutes after nine.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Minerva stared as the boy put himself into the dueling stance,
his wand held low. For a second Minerva wondered if Harry might
possibly - no, that was completely ridiculous, it was <em>Mad-Eye
Moody</em> and that was beyond impossible. Of course that was what
she'd thought about his partial Transfiguration, too...</p>
<p>"Let's go, then," Harry said and fell over.</p>
<p>Severus gave a single chuckle. "Mr. Potter has his points, I
must confess," the Potions Master said. "Though I would never say
it while he was awake, and if you repeat the words I shall deny
them, for the boy's ego is quite large enough already. Mr. Potter
does have his points, Mad-Eye, but duelling is not among them."</p>
<p>Mad-Eye's own chuckle was lower and grimmer. "Oh, yes," said
Mad-Eye. "Only fools duel. Standing like that and waiting for me to
attack, what <em>was</em> the boy thinking? Why, I ought to give
him a scar, to remember this occasion -"</p>
<p>"Alastor!" barked Albus, just as she cried "Stop!", Severus
dashed forward, and Mad-Eye Moody deliberately leveled his wand on
Harry Potter's body.</p>
<p>"<em>Stupefy!</em> "</p>
<p>Mad-Eye's body seemed to almost flicker as he spun on his wooden
foot like lightning, faster than she'd ever seen anyone move
without magic, the red Stunning Hex passing through the suddenly
empty air and barely missing Severus to crash into the opposite
wall, and by the time her eyes jerked back to Moody there were
seventeen radiant orbs in the pattern of a <em>Sagitta Magica,</em>
visible for only an instant before they streaked brilliance and
struck <em>something</em> that fell to the floor with a thud -</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"Hello again, Harry," said Dumbledore.</p>
<p>"I cannot <em>believe</em> that guy's reaction time," Harry
said, brushing off his Cloak as he stood up from where he'd been
lying invisible on the floor, unseen by his previous self. "I can't
believe his movement speed either. I'm going to have to figure out
some way to zap him without speaking an incantation that gives it
away..."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>- and then Mad-Eye ducked hard and fast, his hands hitting flat
on the floor. She almost didn't see the two tiny white threads
passing through the space he'd been, but her eyes went to the blue
spark when the threads impacted on one of the Headmaster's devices,
and by the time she managed to turn her eyes back, Mad-Eye had spun
smoothly up to his feet, his wand was dancing unseeably fast and
there was another thudding sound -</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"Hello again, Harry."</p>
<p>"Pardon me, Headmaster, but could you let me go down your
stairs, and then come back up again, before I make the final jump
backward? This is going to take longer than one hour of preparation
-"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Minerva gaped at Mad-Eye Moody, who hadn't lowered his wand in
the slightest; and Severus had a look on his face that was almost
like shock.</p>
<p>"Well, boy?" said Mad-Eye Moody. "What else have you got?"</p>
<p>Harry Potter's head appeared, floating in midair as an invisible
hand drew back the hood of his invisibility cloak.</p>
<p>"That eye," said Harry Potter. There was a strange fierce light
in the boy's eyes. "That isn't any ordinary device. It can see
right through my invisibility cloak. You dodged my Transfigured
taser as soon as I started raising it, even though I didn't speak
any incantations. And now that I've watched it again - you spotted
all my Time-Turned selves the moment you Flooed into this room,
didn't you?"</p>
<p>Mad-Eye Moody was smiling, the same teeth-bared grin she'd seen
him wear as they'd faced off against Voldemort himself. "Spend a
hundred years hunting Dark wizards, and you see everything," said
Moody. "I once arrested a young Japanese who tried a similar trick.
He found out the hard way that his shadow replica technique was no
match for this eye of mine."</p>
<p>"You see in all directions," Harry Potter said, that strange
fierce light still in his gaze. "No matter where that eye is
pointing, it sees everything around you."</p>
<p>Moody's tiger-grin grew wider. "There's no more of you in this
room, now," Mad-Eye said. "Think that's because you'll give up
after this time, or because you'll win? Any bets, boy?"</p>
<p>"It's my final attempt because I decided to stake my last three
hours on one shot," said Harry Potter. "As for whether I win -"</p>
<p>There was a blur filling the whole air of the Headmaster's
office. Mad-Eye Moody leapt to one side with blinding speed and an
instant later Harry's head darted backward as he cried
"<em>Stuporfy!</em> "</p>
<p>Three shimmers in the air went past Harry's moving head, just as
a red bolt erupted from Harry's location, shooting past Moody as he
dodged in yet another direction -</p>
<p>If she'd blinked, she would have missed it, the red bolt making
an angled turn in midair and slamming into Moody's ear.</p>
<p>Moody fell.</p>
<p>Harry Potter's floating head dropped to the height of a
first-year on their hands and knees, then dropped further to the
ground, his face showing sudden exhaustion.</p>
<p>Minerva McGonagall said, "What in <em>Merlin's name</em> just
-"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"So you went to Flitwick, then," Moody said. The retired Auror
was now sitting in a chair, drinking long draughts from a
restorative in a bottle he'd taken off his belt.</p>
<p>Harry Potter nodded, now sitting in his own chair instead of
perched on an armrest. "I tried the Defense Professor first, but -"
The boy grimaced. "He... wasn't available. Well, I'd decided it was
worth risking five House points, and if you say a risk is worth it,
you can't complain when you have to pay up. Anyway, I figured that
if you had an eye that saw things other people couldn't see, then
as Isaac Asimov pointed out in <em>Second Foundation</em>, the
weapon to use is a brilliant light. Read enough science fiction,
you know, and you'll read everything at least once. Anyway, I told
Professor Flitwick that I needed a Charm that would make a huge
number of shapes, bright and flickering and filling the whole
office, but invisible, so only your eye could see them. I had no
idea what it would even <em>mean</em> to cast an illusion and then
make it invisible, but I figured if I didn't mention that out loud,
Professor Flitwick would just do it anyway, and he did. Turns out
there was no spell like that I could cast myself, but Flitwick
Charmed me a one-time device for it - though I had to persuade him
that it wasn't cheating, since nothing could <em>possibly</em> be
cheating against an Auror who'd lived long enough to retire. And
then I still didn't see how I could hit you, when you were moving
that fast. So I asked about targeted spells, and that was when
Flitwick showed me that hex I cast at the end, the Swerving
Stunner. It's one of Professor Flitwick's own inventions - he's a
champion duellist as well as a Charms Master -"</p>
<p>"I know that, son."</p>
<p>"Sorry. Anyway, the Professor says he left the duelling circuit
before he got a chance to use that spell, since it only works as a
finishing move on an unshielded opponent. The hex gets as close to
the target as possible along its original trajectory, and then once
it detects that the target is getting more distant again, the hex
turns in midair and heads straight for the target. It can only
swerve once - but the incantation sounds very close to 'Stupefy'
and the hex is the same red color, so if the enemy thinks it's a
regular Stunning Hex and tries a normal dodge, that midair
retargeting will finish them off. Oh, and the Professor requested
that none of us talk about his special move, just in case he does
get a chance to use it during competition someday."</p>
<p>"But -" said Professor McGonagall. She glanced at Mad-Eye Moody,
who was nodding his approval, and at Severus, who was keeping his
face decidedly blank. "Mr. Potter, you just stunned <em>Mad-Eye
Moody!</em> The most famous Dark wizard hunter in the history of
the Auror Office! That should've been impossible!"</p>
<p>Moody let out a dark chuckle. "What's <em>your</em> answer to
that one, kid? I'm curious."</p>
<p>"Well..." Harry said. "First of all, Professor McGonagall,
neither of us were fighting seriously."</p>
<p><em>"Neither of you?"</em></p>
<p>"Of course," Harry said. "In a serious fight, Mr. Moody would've
dropped all my copies immediately without waiting for them to
attack. And on my side, if it was <em>actually</em> necessary to
take down the most famous Auror in the history of the office, I'd
get Headmaster Dumbledore to do it for me. And beyond that... since
that <em>wasn't</em> a real fight..." Harry paused. "How can I put
this? Wizards are used to duels where people fight back and forth
with spells for a while. But if two Muggles with guns stand in a
small room and fire bullets at each other... then whoever hits
first, wins. And if one of them is deliberately missing his shots,
giving the other person one chance after another - like Mr. Moody
gave me one chance after another - well, you'd have to be pretty
pathetic to lose."</p>
<p>"Oh, not <em>that</em> pathetic," Moody said with a slightly
threatening grin.</p>
<p>Harry didn't seem to notice. "You might say that Mr. Moody was
testing me to see if I would try to <em>fight</em> him, or try to
<em>win.</em> That is, whether I'd carry out the <em>role</em> of
somebody fighting - use standard spells I already knew, even though
I didn't expect the <em>consequences</em> of that action to be
victory - or if I'd search through unusual plans until I found
something that <em>could</em> win. Like the difference between a
student who sits in class because that's what students do, versus a
student who cares enough to ask themselves what it takes to
<em>actually</em> learn a piece of material, and practices however
necessary - you see, Professor McGonagall? When you look at it that
way - realize that Mr. Moody was giving me chances, and that I
shouldn't attack in the first place unless I think I can win - then
I don't come out looking so well, since it actually took me three
tries to get him. Plus, like I said, in a real fight Mr. Moody
could've turned <em>himself</em> invisible, or put up shields
-"</p>
<p>"Don't go relying too much on shields, boy," Mad-Eye said. The
leather-clad Auror took another sip from his restorative flask.
"What you learn in your first year at the academy doesn't stay true
forever, not against the strongest Dark Wizards. Every shield ever
made, there's some curse that goes straight through it, if you're
not quick enough to cast the counter. And there's one curse that
goes through everything, and it's a curse any Death Eater will
use."</p>
<p>Harry Potter nodded gravely. "Right, some spells are impossible
to block. I'll remember that, in case anyone casts the Killing
Curse at me. Again."</p>
<p>"That kind of cleverness gets people killed, boy, and don't you
forget it."</p>
<p>A sad-sounding sigh from the Boy-Who-Lived. "I know. Sorry."</p>
<p>"So, son. You had something to say about when Albus and I go
after Lockhart?"</p>
<p>Harry opened his mouth, then paused. "I won't tell you how to
run a war," the Boy-Who-Lived said eventually. "I don't have any
experience at that. All I know is that there are consequences.
Please be advised that my own assessment is that Lockhart is
probably innocent, so if you can avoid hurting him without too much
risk -" The boy shrugged. "I don't know the cost. Just please, if
you can, be careful not to hurt him if he's innocent."</p>
<p>"If I can," said Moody.</p>
<p>"And - you're aiming to look through his mind for evidence about
the Dark Lord, aren't you? I don't know what the rules are in
magical Britain about admissible evidence - but everyone's always
guilty of breaking <em>some</em> law or another, there's just too
many laws. So if it's <em>not</em> about the Dark Lord, don't turn
him in to the Ministry, just Obliviate him and go, okay?"</p>
<p>Moody frowned. "Son, nobody gains power that fast without being
up to <em>something.</em>"</p>
<p>"Then leave it for the ordinary Aurors, if and when they find
evidence the ordinary way. Please, Mr. Moody. Call it a quirk of my
Muggle upbringing, but if it's <em>not</em> about the war I don't
want us to be the evil police who break into people's houses in the
middle of the night, rummage through their minds and send them off
to Azkaban."</p>
<p>"I don't see the sense of it, son, but I suppose I could do you
the favor."</p>
<p>"Is there aught else, Alastor?" inquired Albus.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Moody. "About that Defense Professor of yours -"</p>
<p><em>Hypothesis: Gilderoy Lockhart: END</em></p>

<p><em>Hypothesis: Dumbledore</em><br>
<em>(April 9th, 1992, 5:32pm)</em></p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>As Professor Quirrell slowly raised up his tea, the teacup
jerked in midair, sending the dark translucent liquid just barely
slopping over the side, so that only three single drops crawled
down the side of the teacup. Harry would have missed it, if he
hadn't happened to be watching closely; for Professor Quirrell's
hand was perfectly steady on the cup before and after.</p>
<p>If that small jerky motion advanced to a constant tremor, it
would be the end of any non-wandless magic for the Defense
Professor. Wandwork had no room for trembling fingers. How much
that would <em>actually</em> handicap Professor Quirrell, if at
all, Harry couldn't guess. The Defense Professor was certainly
capable of wandless magic, yet still tended to use a wand for
larger things - but for him that might only be a convenience...</p>
<p>"Insanity," said Professor Quirrell, as he carefully sipped from
his tea - he was looking at the teacup, not at Harry, which was
unusual for him - "can be a signature all its own."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor's small office was silent, the
sound-warded room quiet in a way the Headmaster's office never
could be. Sometimes the two of them both happened to finish
exhaling or inhaling at the same time; and then there was an
auditory emptiness that was almost a sound in itself.</p>
<p>"I'll agree with that in one sense," Harry said. "If somebody
tells me that everyone is <em>staring</em> at them and that their
underwear is being dusted with thought-controlling powder, I know
they're psychotic, because that's the standard signature of
psychosis. But if you tell me that <em>anything</em> confusing
points to Albus Dumbledore as a suspect, that seems...
overreaching. Just because I can't see a purpose doesn't mean there
<em>is</em> no purpose."</p>
<p>"Purposeless?" said Professor Quirrell. "Oh, but the madness of
Dumbledore is not that he is purposeless, but that he has too many
purposes. The Headmaster might have planned this to make Lucius
Malfoy throw away his game for vengeance on you - or it might be a
dozen other plots. Who knows what the Headmaster thinks he has
reason to do, when he has found reason to do so many strange things
already?"</p>
<p>Harry had politely declined tea, even knowing that Professor
Quirrell would know what it meant. He'd considered bringing his own
can of soda - but had decided against that as well, after realizing
how easy it would be for the Defense Professor to teleport in a bit
of potion, even if the two of them couldn't touch each other with
direct magic.</p>
<p>"I have seen a little now of Dumbledore," Harry said. "Unless
everything I have seen is a lie, I find it difficult to believe
that he would plot to send any Hogwarts student to Azkaban.
Ever."</p>
<p>"Ah," the Defense Professor said softly, the tiny reflection of
the teacup gleaming in his pale eyes. "But perhaps that is another
signature, Mr. Potter. You have not yet comprehended the
perspective of a man like Dumbledore. If he must, in some
sufficiently noble cause, sacrifice a student - why, who would he
choose, but she who declared herself a heroine?"</p>
<p>That gave Harry some pause. It might just be hindsight bias, but
that <em>did</em> seem to concentrate some of that hypotheses's
probability mass onto framing Hermione in particular. Similarly,
Professor Quirrell <em>had</em> predicted in advance that
Dumbledore might target Draco...</p>
<p><em>But if it's you behind all of this, Professor, you might
have shaped your plans to frame the Headmaster, and taken care to
cast suspicion on him in advance.</em></p>
<p>The concept of 'evidence' had something of a different meaning,
when you were dealing with someone who had declared themselves to
play the game at 'one level higher than you'.</p>
<p>"I see your point, Professor," Harry said evenly, giving no hint
of his other thoughts. "So you think it most probable that it was
the Headmaster who framed Hermione?"</p>
<p>"Not necessarily, Mr. Potter." Professor Quirrell drained his
teacup in one swallow and then set it down, the cup making a sharp
rap as it descended. "There is also Severus Snape - though what he
might think to gain from this, I could not guess. Thus he is not my
prime suspect either."</p>
<p>"Then who is?" Harry said, somewhat puzzled. Professor Quirrell
surely wasn't about to reply 'You-Know-Who' -</p>
<p>"The Aurors have a rule," said Professor Quirrell. "Investigate
the victim. Many would-be criminals imagine that if they are the
apparent victims of a crime, they shall not be suspected. So many
criminals imagine it, indeed, that every senior Auror has seen it a
dozen times over."</p>
<p>"You're not seriously trying to convince me that
<em>Hermione</em> -"</p>
<p>The Defense Professor was giving Harry one of those slit-eyed
<em>looks</em> that meant he was being stupid.</p>
<p><em>Draco?</em> Draco had been interrogated under Veritaserum -
but Lucius might have had enough control to subvert Aurors to...
oh.</p>
<p>"You think <em>Lucius Malfoy</em> set up <em>his own son?</em> "
Harry said.</p>
<p>"Why not?" Professor Quirrell said softly. "From Mr. Malfoy's
recorded testimony, Mr. Potter, I gather that you enjoyed some
success in changing Mr. Malfoy's political views. If Lucius Malfoy
learned of that earlier... he might have decided that his
<em>former</em> heir had become a liability."</p>
<p>"I don't buy it," Harry said flatly.</p>
<p>"You are being wantonly naive, Mr. Potter. The history books are
full of family disputes turned murderous, for inconveniences and
threats far less than those which Mr. Malfoy posed to his father. I
suppose next you will tell me that Lord Malfoy of the Death Eaters
is far too gentle to wish his son such harm." A tinge of heavy
sarcasm.</p>
<p>"Well, yes, frankly," Harry said. "Love is real, Professor, a
phenomenon with observable effects. Brains are real, emotions are
real, and love is as much a part of the real world as apples and
trees. If you made experimental predictions without taking parental
love into account, you'd have a heck of a time explaining why my
own parents didn't abandon me at an orphanage after the Incident
with the Science Project."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor did not react to this at all.</p>
<p>Harry continued. "From what Draco says, Lucius prioritized him
over important Wizengamot votes. That's significant evidence, since
there's less expensive ways to fake love, if you just want to fake
it. And it's not like the prior probability of a parent loving
their child is <em>low</em>. I suppose it's possible that Lucius
was just taking on the <em>role</em> of a loving father, and he
renounced that role after he learned Draco was consorting with
Muggleborns. But as the saying goes, Professor, one must
distinguish possibility from probability."</p>
<p>"All the better the crime," the Defense Professor said, still in
that soft tone, "if no one would believe it of him."</p>
<p>"And how would Lucius even Memory-Charm Hermione in the first
place, without setting off the wards? <em>He's</em> not a Professor
- oh, right, you think it's Professor Snape."</p>
<p>"Wrong," said the Defense Professor. "Lucius Malfoy would trust
no servant with that mission. But suppose some Hogwarts Professor,
intelligent enough to cast a well-formed Memory Charm but of no
great fighting ability, is visiting Hogsmeade. From a dark alley
the black-clad form of Malfoy steps forth - he would go in person,
for this - and speaks to her a single word."</p>
<p>"<em>Imperio</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>Legilimens,</em> rather," said Professor Quirrell. "I do
not know if the Hogwarts wards would trigger for a returning
Professor under the Imperius Curse. And if I do not know, Malfoy
probably does not know either. But Malfoy is a perfect Occlumens at
least; he might be able to use Legilimency. And for the
target...perhaps Aurora Sinistra; none would question the Astronomy
Professor moving about at night."</p>
<p>"Or even more obviously, Professor Sprout," said Harry. "Since
she's the last person anyone would suspect."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor hesitated minutely. "Perhaps."</p>
<p>"Actually," Harry said then, putting a thoughtful frown on his
face, "I don't suppose you know offhand if any of the current
Professors at Hogwarts were around back when Mr. Hagrid got framed
in 1943?"</p>
<p>"Dumbledore taught Transfiguration, Kettleburn taught Magical
Creatures, and Vector taught Arithmancy," Professor Quirrell said
at once. "And I believe that Bathsheda Babbling, now of Ancient
Runes, was then a Ravenclaw prefect. But Mr. Potter, there is no
reason to suppose that anyone besides You-Know-Who was involved in
<em>that</em> affair."</p>
<p>Harry shrugged artfully. "Seemed worth asking the question, just
to check. Anyway, Professor, I agree it's possible that some
outsider Legilimized a member of Hogwarts staff - and then
Obliviated them afterward, there's no way anyone would forget that
part. But I <em>don't</em> think Lucius Malfoy is a probable
candidate for the mastermind. It's possible but not probable that
all of Lucius's apparent love for Draco was just a sense of duty,
and that it all went up in a puff of smoke. It's possible though
not probable that everything Lucius did in front of the Wizengamot
was just an act. People's outsides do not always resemble their
insides, like you said. But there's one piece of evidence that
doesn't fit at all."</p>
<p>"And that would be?" said the Defense Professor, his eyes
half-lidded.</p>
<p>"Lucius tried to reject a hundred thousand Galleons for
Hermione's life. I saw how surprised the Wizengamot was, when
Lucius said he was refusing it despite the rules of honor. The
Wizengamot didn't <em>expect</em> that of him. Why
<em>wouldn't</em> he just take the money while acting all indignant
and pretending to grit his teeth? He wouldn't actually care that
much about throwing Hermione into Azkaban."</p>
<p>There was a pause. "Perhaps the role he was playing ran away
with him," said Professor Quirrell. "It does happen, Mr. Potter, in
the heat of the moment."</p>
<p>"Perhaps," Harry said. "But it's still one more
<em>improbability</em> to be postulated - and by the time you have
to add up that many excuses in a theory, it can't be at the top of
the list anymore. Anything else in particular you think I ought to
think about, within the range of all other possibilities?"</p>
<p>There was a long silence. The Defense Professor's eyes dropped
down to look at the empty teacup before them, seeming unusually
distant.</p>
<p>"I suppose I can think of one final suspect," the Defense
Professor said at last.</p>
<p>Harry nodded.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor didn't seem to notice, but only spoke on.
"Has the Headmaster has told you anything - even a hint - about
Professor Trelawney's prophecy?"</p>
<p>"<em>Huh?</em> " Harry said automatically, converting his own
sudden shock into the best dissembling he could manage. It probably
was at the wrong level to fool Professor Quirrell but Harry
<em>certainly</em> couldn't take time to think before replying -
<em>wait, but how on Earth would Professor Quirrell know about</em>
that <em>-</em> "Professor Trelawney made a prophecy?"</p>
<p>"You <em>were</em> there to hear its beginning," Professor
Quirrell said, frowning. "You called out to the entire school that
the prophecy could not be about you, since you were not coming
here, you were already here."</p>
<p><em>HE IS COMING. THE ONE WHO WILL TEAR APART THE VERY
-</em></p>
<p>And that was as far as Professor Trelawney had gotten before
Dumbledore had grabbed her and vanished.</p>
<p>"Oh, <em>that</em> prophecy," Harry said. "Sorry! It went clear
out of my mind."</p>
<p>Harry thought he'd put too much force into the end statement,
and was 80%-expecting Professor Quirrell to say, <em>Aha, now Mr.
Potter, what is this mysterious</em> other <em>prophecy you went to
such lengths to deny -</em></p>
<p>"That is foolish," the Defense Professor said sharply, "if
indeed you are telling me the truth. Prophecies are not trivial
things. I have racked my brain much over the little that I heard,
but such a small fragment is simply too little."</p>
<p>"You think the one who's coming is the one who might've framed
Hermione?" said Harry. As his mind allocated yet another
hypothesis, <em>uncertain predicate referent,
he-who-is-coming.</em></p>
<p>"With no offense meant to Miss Granger," the Defense Professor
said with another frown, "her life or death does not seem that
important. But someone <em>was</em> to come - one who, in your
interpretation, was not already there - and someone so significant,
and unknown as a player... who knows what <em>else</em> they may
have done?"</p>
<p>Harry nodded, and mentally sighed because he was going to have
to redo his Lord-Voldemort odds calculation with yet another piece
of evidence in the mix.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell spoke with eyes half-lidded, looking out like
through slits. "More than the question of whom the prophecy spoke -
who was meant to <em>hear</em> it? It is said that fates are spoken
to those with the power to cause them or avert them. Dumbledore.
Myself. You. As a distant fourth, Severus Snape. But of those four,
Dumbledore and Snape would often be in Trelawney's presence. You
and I are the ones who would not have spent much time around her
before that Sunday. I think it quite likely that the prophecy was
meant for one of <em>us</em> - before Dumbledore took the
prophetess away. <em>Did</em> the Headmaster say nothing more to
you?" Professor Quirrell's voice was demanding now. "I thought I
heard too much force in that denial, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>"Honestly, no," Harry said. "It had honestly slipped clear out
of my mind."</p>
<p>"Then I am rather put out with him," Professor Quirrell said
softly. "In fact, I think that I am angry."</p>
<p>Harry said nothing. He didn't even sweat. It might've been a
poor reason for confidence, but on this particular score, Harry did
happen to be innocent.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell nodded once, sharply, as though in
acknowledgment. "If there is nothing more to say between us, Mr.
Potter, you may go."</p>
<p>"I can think of one <em>other</em> suspect," Harry said.
"Someone you didn't put on your list at all. Would you analyze him
to me, Professor?"</p>
<p>There was another of those moments of silence that was almost a
sound in itself.</p>
<p>"As for <em>that</em> suspect," the Defense Professor said
softly, "I think you shall prosecute him on your own, Mr. Potter,
without help from me. I have heard such requests before, and
experience leads me to refuse. Either I will do too good a job of
prosecuting myself, and convince you that I am guilty - or else you
will decide that my prosecution was too half-hearted, and that I am
guilty. I will remark only this in my defense - that I would have
needed a very good reason indeed to jeopardize your fragile
alliance with the heir to House Malfoy."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Hypothesis: The Defense Professor</em><br>
<em>(April 8th, 1992, 8:37pm)</em></p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"...so I fear I must take my leave," Dumbledore was saying
gravely. "I promised Quirinus... that is to say, I promised the
Defense Professor... that I would not make any attempt to uncover
his true identity, in my own person or any other."</p>
<p>"And why'd you make a fool promise like that, then?" snapped
Mad-Eye Moody.</p>
<p>"It was an unalterable condition of his employment, or so he
said." Dumbledore glanced at Professor McGonagall, a wry smile
briefly flitting over his face. "And Minerva made it clear to me
that Hogwarts <em>required</em> a competent Defense Professor this
year, even if I had to haul Grindelwald out of Nurmengard and
prevail on old affections to persuade him to take the
position."</p>
<p>"I did not <em>quite</em> phrase it in that fashion -"</p>
<p>"Your expression said it for you, my dear."</p>
<p>And so soon the four of them - Harry, Professor McGonagall, the
Potions Master, and Alastor Moody aka 'Mad-Eye' - were ensconced
all by themselves in the Headmaster's office.</p>
<p>It was strange how the Headmaster's office seemed...
<em>unbalanced...</em> without the Headmaster in it. If you didn't
have the ancient wizened master to make it all seem
<em>solemn</em>, you were just four people trying to have a serious
meeting while surrounded by bizarre, noisy gidgets. Clearly visible
from where Harry had perched himself on his chair's arm was a
truncated-conical object, like a cone with its top snipped off,
slowly spinning around a pulsating central light which it shaded
but did not obscure; and each time the inner light pulsated, the
assembly made a <em>vroop-vroop-vroop</em> sound that sounded oddly
distant, muffled like it was coming from behind four solid walls,
even though the spinning-conical-section thingy was only a meter or
two away.</p>
<p><em>Vroop... vroop... vroop</em>...</p>
<p>And then there were the various still-breathing bodies of Harry
Potter he'd stashed in one quiet corner, cleaning up a mess that
was his own in more ways than one. (Only one body <em>wasn't</em>
inside a copy of the Invisibility Cloak; but then it merely took a
small effort of concentration for Harry to perceive his other
selves beneath the Cloak of which he was master - an effort which
Harry had carefully <em>not</em> put forth earlier, to avoid
getting advance temporal information he wanted to determine by his
own decision.) The sad thing was that by this point, having his own
body visibly lying in a corner didn't seem all that crazy. It was
just... Hogwarts.</p>
<p>"All right, then," Moody said, looking rather sour about it.
From within his leather armor, the scarred man took out a black
folder. "This is a copy of what Amelia's people put together. She
almost certainly knows we've got it, but it's all off the books,
that clear? Anyway -"</p>
<p>And Moody told them who the Department of Magical Law
Enforcement thought 'Quirinus Quirrell' really was. A seemingly
ordinary Hogwarts student (though talented enough that he'd been
only narrowly beaten out for the Head Boy position) who'd gone
vacationing in Albania after his graduation, disappeared, returned
after 25 years, and then been caught up in the Wizarding War -</p>
<p>"It was murdering the House of Monroe that made Voldie's name,"
Moody said. "Until then, he was just another Dark Wizard with
delusions of grandeur and Bellatrix Black. But after that -" Moody
snorted. "Every fool in the country flocked to serve him. You
would've <em>hoped</em> the Wizengamot would turn serious, once
they realized Voldie was willing to kill their own sacred selves.
And that's just what the bastards did - <em>hope</em> that some
other bastard would turn serious. None of the cowards wanted to
step in front. It was Monroe, Crouch, Bones, and Longbottom. That
was nearly everyone in the Ministry who'd dare say a word that
might give Voldie offense."</p>
<p>"That was how your House came to be ennobled, Mr. Potter,"
injected the solemn voice of Professor McGonagall. "There is an
ancient law that if anyone ends a Most Ancient House, whoever
avenges that blood will be made Noble. To be sure, the House of
Potter was already older than some lines called Ancient. But yours
was titled a Noble House of Britain after the end of the war, in
recognition that you had avenged the Most Ancient House of
Monroe."</p>
<p>"Flush of gratitude and all that," Mad-Eye Moody said sourly.
"It didn't last, but at least James and Lily got a fancy title and
a useless medal to take to their graves. But that's leaving out
eight years of complete horror after Monroe disappeared and Regulus
Black - he was Monroe's private source in the Death Eaters, we're
pretty sure - was executed by Voldie. Like a dam breaking and gore
flooding out, drowning the whole country. Albus bloody Dumbledore
himself had to step into Monroe's shoes, and that was barely enough
for us to survive."</p>
<p>Harry listened with an odd sense of unreality. Some of it
<em>felt</em> right, matched up with observation - especially with
the speech Professor Quirrell had made before Christmas - and
yet...</p>
<p>This was <em>Professor Quirrell</em> they were talking
about.</p>
<p>"So that's who the Department thinks is your Defense Professor,"
Mad-Eye Moody finished up his account. "Now what do <em>you</em>
think, son?"</p>
<p>"Well..." Harry said slowly. <em>It is also possible to have a
mask behind the mask.</em> "The obvious next thought is that this
'David Monroe' person died in the war after all, and this is just
someone else pretending to be David Monroe pretending to be
Quirinus Quirrell."</p>
<p>"That's <em>obvious?</em> " said Professor McGonagall. "Dear
Merlin..."</p>
<p>"Really, boy?" said Mad-Eye Moody, his blue eye spinning
rapidly. "I'd say that's a little... <em>paranoid.</em>"</p>
<p><em>You don't know Professor Quirrell,</em> Harry did not say.
"It's an easy theory to test," Harry said out loud. "Just check
whether the Defense Professor remembers something about the war
that the real David Monroe would've known. Though I suppose, if
he's playing the part of David Monroe <em>pretending</em> to be
someone else, he has a good excuse to <em>pretend</em> he's
pretending he doesn't know what you're talking about -"</p>
<p>"A <em>little</em> paranoid," said the scarred man, his voice
rising. "<em>Not paranoid enough! CONSTANT VIGILANCE!</em> Think
about it, lad - what if the <em>real</em> David Monroe never came
back from Albania?"</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>"I see..." Harry said.</p>
<p>"Of course you do," Professor McGonagall said. "Don't mind me,
please. I'll just sit here quietly going mad."</p>
<p>"In this line of work, if you survive, you learn that there's
three kinds of Dark Wizards," Moody said grimly; his wand wasn't
pointed at anyone, it was angled slightly downward, but it was in
his hand. It had never left his hand since the moment he'd entered
the room. "There's Dark Wizards that have one name. There's Dark
Wizards that have two names. And there's Dark Wizards that change
names like you and I change clothes. I saw 'Monroe' go through
three Death Eaters like he was snapping twigs. There's not many
wizards that good at age forty-five. Dumbledore, maybe, but not
many others."</p>
<p>"Perhaps that is true," said the Potions Master from where he
was lurking. "But what of it, Mad-Eye? Whatever his identity,
Monroe was surely the Dark Lord's enemy. I've heard Death Eaters
curse his name even after they thought him dead. They feared him
well."</p>
<p>"So far as Defense Professors are concerned," Professor
McGonagall said primly, "I shall take it and be grateful."</p>
<p>Moody swung around to glare at her. "Just where the devil was
'Monroe' all those years he was gone, eh? Maybe he thought he could
make a name for himself in Britain by opposing Voldie, and vanished
away when he found out he was wrong. Then why'd he come back
<em>now,</em> hah? What's his <em>new</em> plan?"</p>
<p>"He, ah..." Harry ventured tentatively. "He <em>says</em> he
always wanted to be a great Defense Professor because all the best
fighting wizards have taught at Hogwarts. And he kind of
<em>is</em> being an incredibly good Defense Professor, actually...
I mean, if he just wanted to keep up a disguise, he could get away
with <em>much</em> sloppier work..."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall was nodding firmly.</p>
<p>"Naive," Moody said flatly. "I suppose you all haven't wondered
if your Defense Professor set up the whole House of Monroe to be
wiped out?"</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " cried Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>"Our mystery wizard hears about a missing kid from a Most
Ancient House of Britain," Moody said. "Steps into the shoes of
'David Monroe', but stays away from the real Monroe family. But
eventually the House is bound to notice something wrong. So this
imposter somehow prods Voldie into wiping them all out - maybe
leaked a password they'd given him for their wards - and then he
was a Lord of the Wizengamot!"</p>
<p>There seemed to be a fight going on inside Harry's mind between
Hufflepuff One, who'd never trusted the Defense Professor in the
first place; and Hufflepuff Two, who was far too loyal to Harry's
friend, Professor Quirrell, to believe something like that just
because Moody said so.</p>
<p><em>It</em> is <em>kind of obvious, though,</em> observed his
Slytherin part. <em>I mean, do you actually believe that under
natural circumstances, anyone would end up as the last heir to a
Most Ancient House AND Lord Voldemort killed his family AND he has
to avenge his martial arts sensei? If anything I'd say he went too
far over the top in setting up his new identity as the ideal
literary hero. That sort of thing doesn't happen in real
life.</em></p>
<p><em>This from an orphan who was raised unaware of his
heritage,</em> commented Harry's Inner Critic. <em>With a prophecy
about him. You know, I don't think we've ever read a story about
two equally destined heroes competing to see who's cliched enough
to take down the villain -</em></p>
<p><em>Yes,</em> replied the central Harry over the distant
vroop-ing noise in the background, <em>it's a very sad life we lead
and YOU'RE NOT HELPING.</em></p>
<p><em>There's only one thing to do at this point,</em> said
Ravenclaw. <em>And we all know what it is, so why argue?</em></p>
<p><em>But,</em> Harry replied, <em>how</em> do <em>we test
experimentally whether or not Professor Quirrell is the original
David Monroe? I mean, what sort of observable behaves differently,
depending on whether he's the real David Monroe or an
impostor?</em></p>
<p>"What do you want me to do about it, Mad-Eye?" Professor
McGonagall was demanding. "I can't -"</p>
<p>"You can," the scarred man said, glaring at her fiercely. "Just
fire the bloody Defense Professor."</p>
<p>"You say that <em>every</em> year," said Professor
McGonagall.</p>
<p>"Yes, and I'm always right!"</p>
<p>"Constant vigilance or no, Alastor, the students must be
taught!"</p>
<p>Moody snorted. "Pfah! I swear the curse gets worse every year,
as you lot get more and more reluctant to let them go. Your
precious Professor Quirrell would have to <em>be</em> Grindelwald
in disguise, to get himself sent off!"</p>
<p>"Is he?" Harry couldn't help asking. "I mean, could he
<em>actually</em> be -"</p>
<p>"I check Grindie's cell every two months," Moody said. "He was
there in March."</p>
<p>"Could the person in the cell be a ringer?"</p>
<p>"I administer a blood test for his identity, son."</p>
<p>"Where do you keep the blood you use as a reference?"</p>
<p>"In a safe place." Something like a smile was stretching the
scarred lips. "Have you considered the Auror Office after you
graduate?"</p>
<p>"Alastor," Professor McGonagall said reluctantly. "The Defense
Professor <em>does</em> have a... health condition. I suppose you
will call it suspicious in itself - but it is by no means certain
that it will be any ill-doing on his part which prevents us from
renewing his employment."</p>
<p>"Yes, his little naptimes," Moody said darkly. "Amelia thinks he
stepped into the path of a high-level curse. Sounds to <em>me</em>
more like a Dark ritual gone wrong!"</p>
<p>"You've no proof of that!" Professor McGonagall said.</p>
<p>"That man might as well be wearing a sign saying 'Dark Wizard'
in glowing green letters over his head."</p>
<p>"Ah..." Harry said. It didn't seem like an especially good time
to ask what Mr. Moody thought of the 'not all sacrificial rituals
are evil' standpoint. "Excuse me, but you said earlier that
Professor Quirrell - I mean the old David Monroe - I mean the
Monroe from the seventies - anyway, you said that person used the
Killing Curse. What does that imply? Does somebody have to be a
Dark Wizard to use it?"</p>
<p>Moody shook his head. "I've used it myself. All it takes is
power and a certain <em>mood.</em>" The grimacing lips were showing
teeth. "The first time I cast it was against a wizard named Gerald
Grice, and you can ask me what <em>he</em> did after you graduate
Hogwarts."</p>
<p>"But why is it Unforgiveable, then?" Harry said. "I mean, a
Cutting Hex can kill someone too. So why's it any better to use a
Reducto instead of Avada Kedav-"</p>
<p>"Shut your mouth!" Moody said sharply. "Someone might take it
the wrong way, your saying that incantation. You <em>look</em> too
young to cast it, but there's such a thing as Polyjuice. And to
answer your question, boy, there's two reasons why that spell's in
the blackest book. The first is that the Killing Curse strikes
directly at the soul, and it'll just keep going until it hits one.
Straight through shields. Straight through <em>walls.</em> There's
a <em>reason</em> why even Aurors fighting Death Eaters weren't
allowed to use it before the Monroe Act."</p>
<p>"Ah," said Harry. "That does seem like an excellent reason to
ban -"</p>
<p>"I'm not finished, son. The second reason is that the Killing
Curse doesn't <em>just</em> take a powerful bit of magic. You've
got to <em>mean</em> it. You've got to <em>want</em> someone dead,
and not for the greater good, either. Killing Grice didn't bring
back Blair Roche, or Nathan Rehfuss, or David Capito. It wasn't for
justice, or to stop him doing it again. <em>I wanted him dead.</em>
You understand now, lad? You don't have to be a Dark Wizard to use
that spell - but you can't be Albus Dumbledore, either. And if
you're arrested for killing with it, there's no possible
defense."</p>
<p>"I... see," murmured the Boy-Who-Lived. <em>You can't want the
person dead as an instrumental value on the way to some positive
future consequence, you can't cast it if you believe it's a
necessary evil, you have to actually want them dead for the sake of
being dead, as a terminal value in your utility function.</em> "A
magically embodied preference for death over life, striking within
the plane of pure life force... that does sound like a difficult
spell to block."</p>
<p>"Not difficult," Moody snapped. "<em>Impossible</em>."</p>
<p>Harry nodded gravely. "But David Monroe - or whoever - used the
Killing Curse against a couple of Death Eaters even <em>before</em>
they wiped out his family. Does that mean he already had to hate
them? Like, the martial arts story was probably true?"</p>
<p>Moody shook his head slightly. "One of the dark truths of the
Killing Curse, son, is that once you've cast it the first time, it
doesn't take much hate to do it again."</p>
<p>"It damages the mind?"</p>
<p>Again Moody shook his head. "No. It's the killing that does
that. Murder tears the soul - but that's just the same if it's a
Cutting Hex. The Killing Curse doesn't crack your soul. It just
takes a cracked soul to cast." If there was a sad expression on the
scarred face, it could not be read. "But that doesn't tell us much
about Monroe. The ones like Dumbledore who'll never be able to cast
the Curse all their lives, because they never crack no matter what
- they're the rare ones, very rare. It only takes a little
cracking."</p>
<p>There was a strange heavy feeling in Harry's chest. He'd
wondered what exactly it had meant, that Lily Potter had tried to
cast the Killing Curse at Lord Voldemort with her last breath. But
surely it was forgiveable, it was <em>right</em> and
<em>proper</em> for a mother to hate the Dark Wizard who was coming
to kill her baby, mocking her for how she couldn't stop him. There
was something wrong with you as a parent if you <em>couldn't</em>
cast Avada Kedavra, in that situation. And no other spell could've
gone past the Dark Lord's shields; you'd have to at least
<em>try</em> to hate the Dark Lord enough to want him dead for the
sake of dead, if that was the only way to save your baby.</p>
<p><em>It only takes a little cracking...</em></p>
<p>"Enough," said Professor McGonagall. "What would you have us
do?"</p>
<p>Moody's smile twisted. "Get rid of the Defense Professor and see
if all your troubles mysteriously clear up. Bet you a Galleon they
do."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall looked like she was in pain. "Alastor - but
- will <em>you</em> teach the classes, if -"</p>
<p>"Ha!" said Moody. "If I ever say yes to that question, check me
for Polyjuice, because it's not me."</p>
<p>"I'll test it experimentally," Harry said. And then, as everyone
looked at him, "I'll ask Professor Quirrell a question that the
real David Monroe would know - like who else was in the Slytherin
class of 1945, or something like that - hopefully without making it
obvious. It won't be definitive proof, he could've studied the
role, but it would be evidence. Still, Mr. Moody, even if Professor
Quirrell isn't the original Monroe, I'm not sure that getting rid
of him is a free action. He saved my life twice -"</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " demanded Moody. "When? How?"</p>
<p>"Once when he knocked down a bunch of witches who were summoning
me toward the ground, once when he figured out that the Dementor
was draining me through my wand. And if Professor Quirrell
<em>wasn't</em> the one who set up Draco Malfoy in the first place,
then he saved Draco Malfoy's life, and things would be a lot worse
if he hadn't. If the Defense Professor <em>isn't</em> behind it all
- he's not someone we can afford to just get rid of."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall nodded firmly.</p>

<p><em>Hypothesis: Severus Snape</em><em><br></em><em>(April 8th,
1992, 9:03pm)</em></p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry and Professor McGonagall now stood on the slowly turning
stairs, turning without descending; or at least <em>one</em> Harry
stood upon those stairs - his other three selves had been left
behind in the Headmaster's office.</p>
<p>"Can I ask you a private question?" Harry said, when he thought
they were far enough away not to be heard. "And in particular,
private from the Headmaster."</p>
<p>"Yes," Professor McGonagall said, not quite sighing. "Though I
hope you realize that I cannot <em>do</em> anything which conflicts
with my duties to -"</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said, "that's exactly what I need to ask you about.
In front of the Wizengamot, when Lucius Malfoy was saying that
Hermione was no part of House Potter and that he wouldn't take the
money, you told Hermione how to swear that oath. I want to know, if
something like that comes up again, if your first duty is to the
Hogwarts student Hermione Granger, or to the head of the Order of
the Phoenix, Albus Dumbledore."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall looked like someone had hit her in the face
with a cast-iron frying-pan, a few minutes earlier, and now she'd
been told that somebody was about to do it again, and not to
flinch.</p>
<p>Harry flinched a little himself. Somewhere along the line he
needed to pick up the knack of <em>not</em> phrasing things to hit
as hard as he possibly could.</p>
<p>The walls rotated around them, behind them, and somehow, they
descended.</p>
<p>"Oh, Mr. Potter," Professor McGonagall said with a low
exhalation. "I... <em>wish</em> you wouldn't ask me such
questions... oh, Harry, I wasn't thinking then, not at all. I only
saw a chance to help Miss Granger and... I <em>was</em> Sorted into
Gryffindor, after all."</p>
<p>"You've got a chance to think now," Harry said. It was all
coming out wrong, but he had to say it <em>anyway,</em> because -
"I'm not asking you to be loyal to <em>me.</em> But if you do know
- if you <em>are</em> sure - what you'll do if it comes down to an
innocent Hogwarts student versus the Order of the Phoenix a second
time..."</p>
<p>But Professor McGonagall shook her head. "I'm <em>not</em>
sure," the Transfiguration Professor whispered. "I don't know if it
was the right choice even then. I'm sorry. I can't decide such
awful things!"</p>
<p>"But you'll do <em>something</em> if it happens again," Harry
said. "Indecision is also a choice. You can't just <em>imagine</em>
having to make an immediate decision?"</p>
<p>"No," Professor McGonagall said, sounding a little stronger; and
Harry realized that he'd accidentally offered a way out. The
Professor's next words confirmed Harry's fears. "Such a dreadful
choice as that, Mr. Potter - I think I should not make it until I
must."</p>
<p>Harry gave an internal sigh. He supposed he had no right to
expect Professor McGonagall to say anything else. In a moral
dilemma where you lost something either way, making the choice
would <em>feel</em> bad either way, so you could temporarily save
yourself a little mental pain by refusing to decide. At the cost of
not being able to plan anything in advance, and at the cost of
incurring a huge bias toward inaction or waiting until too late...
but you couldn't expect a witch to know all that. "All right,"
Harry said.</p>
<p>Though it wasn't right at all, not really. Dumbledore might want
that debt removed, Professor Quirrell would also want Harry out of
that debt. And if the Defense Professor <em>was</em> David Monroe,
or could convincingly <em>appear</em> to be David Monroe, then Lord
Voldemort technically hadn't <em>exterminated</em> the House of
Monroe. In which case somebody might be able to pass a Wizengamot
resolution revoking the Noble status of House Potter, which had
been granted for avenging the Most Ancient House of Monroe.</p>
<p>In which case Hermione's vow of service to a Noble House might
be null and void.</p>
<p>Or maybe not. Harry didn't know anything about the legalities,
especially not whether House Potter got the money <em>back</em> if
someone managed to send Hermione to Azkaban. Just because you lost
something might not mean the payment was returned, legally
speaking. Harry wasn't sure and he didn't dare ask a magical
solicitor...</p>
<p>...it would have been nice to be able to trust at least one
adult to take Hermione's side instead of Dumbledore's, if an issue
like that threatened to come up.</p>
<p>The stairs they were upon ceased rotating, and they were before
the backs of the great stone gargoyles, which rumbled aside,
revealing the hallway.</p>
<p>Harry stepped out -</p>
<p>A hand caught at Harry's shoulder.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter," Professor McGonagall said in a low voice, "why did
you to tell me to keep watch over Professor Snape?"</p>
<p>Harry turned around again.</p>
<p>"You told me to keep watch, and see if he'd changed," Professor
McGonagall went on, her tone urgent. "<em>Why</em> did you say
that, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>It took a moment, at this point, for Harry to think back and
remember why he <em>had</em> said that. Harry and Neville had
rescued Lesath Lestrange from bullies, and then Harry had
confronted Severus in the hallway and, at least according to the
Potions Master's own words, 'almost died' -</p>
<p>"I learned something that made me worry," Harry said after a
moment. "From someone who made me promise not to tell anyone else."
Severus had made Harry swear that their conversations wouldn't be
shared with anyone, and Harry was still bound by it.</p>
<p>"<em>Mr.</em> Potter -" began Professor McGonagall, and then
exhaled, the flash of sharpness disappearing as quickly as it had
come. "Never mind. If you cannot say, you cannot say."</p>
<p>"Why do <em>you</em> ask?" Harry said.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall seemed to hesitate -</p>
<p>"All right, let me be more specific," Harry said. After
Professor Quirrell had done it to <em>him</em> several times, Harry
was starting to get the hang of it. "What change have you
<em>already</em> observed in Professor Snape that you're trying to
decide whether to tell me about?"</p>
<p>"Harry -" the Transfiguration Professor said, and then closed
her mouth.</p>
<p>"I obviously know <em>something</em> you don't," Harry said
helpfully. "See, this is why we can't always put off trying to
decide our awful moral dilemmas."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall closed her eyes, drew in a deep breath,
pinched the bridge of her nose and squeezed it several times. "All
right," she said. "It's a subtle thing... but worrying. How can I
put this... Mr. Potter, have you read many books that young
children are not meant to read?"</p>
<p>"I've read <em>all</em> of them."</p>
<p>"Of course you have. Well... I don't quite understand it myself,
but for so long as Severus has been employed in this school,
stalking about in that awful stained cloak, there has been a
<em>certain sort of girl</em> that stares at him with longing eyes
-"</p>
<p>"You say that like it's a bad thing?" Harry said. "I mean, if
there's one thing I <em>did</em> understand from those books, it's
that you're not supposed to question people's preferences."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall gave Harry a <em>very</em> strange
look.</p>
<p>"I mean," Harry said again, "from what I've read, when I'm a bit
older there's something like a 10% chance that <em>I'll</em> find
Professor Snape attractive, and the important thing is for me to
just accept whatever I -"</p>
<p>"<em>In any case, Mr. Potter,</em> Severus has always been
entirely indifferent to the stares of those young girls. But now -"
Professor McGonagall seemed to realize something, and hastily said,
her hands rising in warding, "Please don't mistake me, Professor
Snape <em>certainly</em> has not taken advantage of any young
witches! Absolutely not! He has never even so much as smiled at
one, not that I ever heard. He has told the young girls to stop
gaping at him. And if they stare at him regardless, he looks away.
That I have seen with my own eyes."</p>
<p>"Er..." Harry said. "Sorry, but just because I've <em>read</em>
those books doesn't mean I understood them. What does all that
<em>mean?</em> "</p>
<p>"That he is <em>noticing</em>," Professor McGonagall said in a
low voice. "It is a subtle thing, but now that I have seen it, I am
certain. And <em>that</em> means... I am very much afraid... that
the bond which held Severus to Albus's cause... may have weakened,
or even broken."</p>
<p>2 + 2 = ...</p>
<p><em>"Snape and Dumbledore?</em> " Then Harry heard the words
that had just come out of his mouth, and hastily added, "Not that
there's anything wrong with that -"</p>
<p><em>"No!"</em> said Professor McGonagall. "Oh, for pity's sake -
I can't explain it to you, Mr. Potter!"</p>
<p>The other shoe finally dropped.</p>
<p><em>He was</em> still <em>in love with my mother?</em></p>
<p>This seemed somewhere between beautifully sad, and pathetic, for
around five seconds before the <em>third</em> shoe dropped.</p>
<p><em>Of course, that was before I gave him my helpful
relationship advice.</em></p>
<p>"I see," Harry said carefully after a few moments. There were
times when saying 'Oops' didn't fully cover it. "You're right,
that's not a good sign."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall put both hands over her face. "Whatever
you're thinking right now," she said in a slightly muffled voice,
"which I assure you is <em>also</em> wrong, I don't want to hear
about it, ever."</p>
<p>"So..." Harry said. "If, like you said, the bond that held
Professor Snape to the Headmaster <em>has</em> broken... what would
he do then?"</p>
<p>There was a long silence.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>What would he do then?</em></p>
<p>Minerva lowered her hands, gazing down at the upturned face of
the Boy-Who-Lived. One simple question shouldn't have caused her so
much dismay. She'd known Severus for years; the two of them bound,
in some strange way, by the prophecy they'd both heard. Though
Minerva suspected, from what she knew of the rules of prophecy,
that she had only <em>overheard</em> it herself. It had been
Severus's acts which had brought about the prophecy's fulfillment.
And the guilt, the heartbreak which had come of that choice, had
been tormenting the Potions Master for years. She couldn't imagine
who Severus would be without it. Her mind went blank, trying to
imagine; her thoughts an empty parchment.</p>
<p><em>Surely</em> Severus was no longer the man he'd once been,
that angry and terribly foolish young man who'd brought the
prophecy before Voldemort in exchange for being admitted into the
Death Eaters. She'd known him for years, and surely Severus was no
longer that man...</p>
<p>Did she really know him at all?</p>
<p>Had <em>anyone</em> ever seen the real Severus Snape?</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"I don't know," Professor McGonagall finally said. "I truly
don't know at all. I can't even imagine. Do <em>you</em> know
anything of this, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>"Er..." Harry said. "I think I can say that my own evidence
points in the same direction as yours. I mean, it increases the
probability that Professor Snape isn't in love with my mother
anymore."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall closed her eyes. "I give up."</p>
<p>"I don't know of anything wrong he's done apart from that,
though," Harry added. "I assume the Headmaster cleared you to ask
me about this?"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall looked away from him, staring at the wall.
"Please don't, Harry."</p>
<p>"All right," Harry said, and turned and hurried out into the
hallways, hearing Professor McGonagall more slowly walking after,
and the rumbling sound of the gargoyles moving into place.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>It was the morning after next, during Potions class, that
Harry's <em>potion of cold resistance</em> boiled over his cauldron
with a green froth and mildly nauseating smell, and Professor
Snape, looking more resigned than disgusted, told Harry to stay
after class. Harry had his own suspicions about this affair, and as
soon as class let out - Hermione, as usual for the last few days,
being the first to flee out the door - the door swung shut and
locked behind the departing students.</p>
<p>"I apologize for ruining your potion, Mr. Potter," Severus Snape
said quietly. There was upon his face the strange sad look that
Harry had seen only once before, in a hallway some time ago. "It
will not be reflected in your grades. Please, sit down."</p>
<p>Harry sat back down at his desk, filling up the time by
scrubbing a bit more at the green stain on the wooden surface, as
the Potions Master incanted a few privacy spells.</p>
<p>When the Potions Master was done, he spoke again. "I... do not
know how to broach this topic, Mr. Potter, so I will simply say
it... before the Dementor, you recovered your memory of the night
your parents died?"</p>
<p>Harry silently nodded.</p>
<p>"If... I know it must not be a pleasant memory, but... if you
could tell me what happened...?"</p>
<p>"Why?" Harry said. His voice was solemn, definitely <em>not
mocking</em> the pleading look that Harry had never expected to see
from that person. "I wouldn't think that would be a pleasant thing
for you to hear either, Professor -"</p>
<p>The Potions Master's voice was almost a whisper. "I have
imagined it every night these last ten years."</p>
<p><em>You know,</em> said Harry's Slytherin side, <em>it might not
be such a good idea to give him closure, if his guilt-based
loyalties are already wavering -</em></p>
<p><em>Shut up. Overruled.</em></p>
<p>It wasn't something that Harry could <em>actually</em> bring
himself to deny. He took one suggestion from his Slytherin side,
and that was it.</p>
<p>"Will you tell me <em>exactly</em> how you came to learn about
the Prophecy?" Harry said. "I'm sorry to make this a trade, I
<em>will</em> tell you afterward, only, it could be really
important -"</p>
<p>"There is little to say. I had come to be interviewed by the
Deputy Headmistress for the position of Potions Master, and so I
was waiting outside the room of the Hog's Head Inn when the
applicant before me, Sybill Trelawney, came to seek the position of
Professor of Divination. As soon as Trelawney finished speaking her
words, I fled, forsaking my chance at Hogwarts's Mastery, and went
to the Dark Lord." The Potions Master's face was drawn and tight.
"I did not even pause to consider why that riddle might have come
to me, before I sold it to another."</p>
<p>"A <em>job interview?</em> " Harry said. "Where you and
Professor Trelawney both happened to be applying, and Professor
McGonagall was interviewing? That seems... like rather a large
coincidence..."</p>
<p>"Seers are the pawns of time, Mr. Potter. Coincidence is beneath
them, and they are above it. I was the one meant to hear that
prophecy and become its fool. Minerva's presence made no final
difference to how it came about. There was no Memory Charm as you
supposed, I do not know why you thought that, but there was no
Memory-Charm, there could have been no Memory-Charm. The voice of a
seer has a quality, an enigma which even Legilimency cannot share,
how could that be imbued in a false memory? Do you think the Dark
Lord would believe my mere words? The Dark Lord seized my mind and
saw the mystification there, even if he could not seize the
mystery, and so he knew the prophecy had been true. The Dark Lord
could have killed me then, having taken what he wanted - I was a
fool indeed to go to him - but he saw something in me I do not
know, and took me into the Death Eaters, though on his terms rather
than mine. That is how I brought it about, brought it all about,
from beginning to end, always my own doing." Severus's voice had
gone rather hoarse, and his face was filled with naked pain. "Now
tell me, please, how did Lily die?"</p>
<p>Harry swallowed twice, and began his recounting.</p>
<p>"James Potter shouted for Lily to run away with me, that he
would hold off You-Know-Who."</p>
<p>"You-Know-Who said -" Harry stopped, the chills going all over
his own skin, his own muscles tightening as if in preparing for a
seizure. The memory was returning strongly, now, accompanied by
cold and darkness in association. "He used... the Killing Curse...
and then he came upstairs somehow, I think he must have flown, I
don't remember any footsteps on stairs or anything like that... and
then my mother said, 'No, not Harry, please not Harry!' or
something like that. And the Dark Lord - his voice was so high,
like water whistling out of a teakettle only <em>cold</em> - the
Dark Lord said -"</p>
<p><em>Stand aside, woman! For you I am not come, only the
boy.</em></p>
<p>The words were very clear in Harry's memory.</p>
<p>"- he told my mother to get out of his way, that he was only
there for <em>me</em>, and my mother begged him to have mercy, and
the Dark Lord said -"</p>
<p><em>I give you this rare chance to flee.</em></p>
<p>"- that he was being generous and giving her a chance to run,
but he wouldn't bother fighting her, and even if she died, she
couldn't save me -" Harry's voice was unsteady, "- and so she ought
to get out of his way. And that was when my mother begged the Dark
Lord to take her life instead of mine - and the Dark Lord - the
Dark Lord said to her - and his voice was lower this time, like he
was dropping a pose -"</p>
<p><em>Very well, I accept the bargain.</em></p>
<p>"- he said that he accepted her offer, and that she should drop
her wand so he could kill her. And then the Dark Lord waited, just
waited. I, I don't know what Lily Potter was thinking, it hadn't
even made sense in the first place, what she said, it wasn't like
the Dark Lord would kill her and then just <em>leave,</em> when
he'd come there for me. Lily Potter didn't say anything, and then
the Dark Lord started laughing at her and it was horrible and - and
she finally tried the only thing left that wasn't abandoning me or
just giving up and dying. I don't know if she even could've, if the
spell would've worked for her, but when you think about, she had to
try. The last thing my mother said was 'Avada Ke-' but the Dark
Lord started his own curse as soon as she said 'Av' and he said it
in less than half a second and there was a flash of green light and
then - and then - <em>and then</em> -"</p>
<p>"That's enough."</p>
<p>Slowly, like a body floating to the surface of water, Harry
returned from wherever he'd been.</p>
<p>"That's enough," the Potions Master said hoarsely. "She died...
Lily died without pain, then? The Dark Lord... did not do anything
to her, before she died?"</p>
<p><em>She died thinking that she'd failed, and that the Dark Lord
was going to kill her baby next. That's pain.</em></p>
<p>"He - the Dark Lord didn't torture her -" Harry said. "If that's
what you're asking."</p>
<p>Behind Harry, the door unlocked itself and swung open.</p>
<p>Harry left.</p>
<p>It was Friday, April 10th, of 1992.</p>

<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Shortly after, there was another knock upon the storeroom
door.</p>
<p>"If you actually care about my mental health," the boy said
without looking up, "you will go away, leave me alone, and wait for
me to come down to dinner. This isn't helping."</p>
<p>The door opened, and the one who had waited outside stepped
in.</p>
<p>"Seriously?" the boy said flatly.</p>
<p>The door closed and clicked behind Severus Snape.</p>
<p>The Potions Master of Hogwarts wore none of his customary
arrogance, or even the dispassionate guise that he ordinarily took
in the Headmaster's office; his gaze was strange, as he looked down
upon the boy guarding that door; his thoughts unfathomable.</p>
<p>"I also cannot imagine what the Deputy Headmistress is
thinking," said the Potions Master of Hogwarts. "Unless I am meant
to serve as a warning of where it will lead you, if you decide to
take the blame for her death upon yourself."</p>
<p>The boy's lips pressed together. "Fine. Let's just skip ahead to
the end of this conversation. You win, Professor Snape. I concede
that you were more responsible for Lily Potter's death than I was
responsible for Hermione Granger's death, and that my guilt can't
stack up to your guilt. And then I ask you to go, and you tell them
that it would probably be best to let me alone for a while. Are we
done?"</p>
<p>"Almost," the Potions Master said. "I am the one who put the
notes under Miss Granger's pillow, telling her where to find the
fights in which she intervened."</p>
<p>The boy did not react to this at all. Finally he spoke. "Because
you dislike bullying."</p>
<p>"Not that alone." There was a note of pain in the Potions
Master's voice that sounded alien to it; it was hard to imagine it
being the same acid voice that instructed children not to stir one
more time or they'd blow off their wrists. "I should have realized
it... very much earlier, I suppose, and yet I did not see it at
all, being entirely absorbed in myself. For me to be placed as Head
of Slytherin... it means that Albus Dumbledore has entirely lost
hope that Slytherin House can be helped. I am certain that
Dumbledore must have tried, I cannot imagine that he did not try,
when he first took trust of Hogwarts. It must have been a severe
blow to him, when after that so much of Slytherin answered to the
Dark Lord's call... he would not have placed me in authority over
that House, acting as I did, unless he had lost all hope." The
Potions Master's shoulders fell, beneath his spotted and stained
cloak. "But you and Miss Granger were trying to do something, and
the two of you had even managed to bring over Mr. Malfoy and Miss
Greengrass, and perhaps those two could have set a different
example... I suppose it was foolish for me to believe. The
Headmaster does not know of what I have done, and I ask you not to
tell him."</p>
<p>"Why are you telling me this?"</p>
<p>"Matters have become far too serious not to tell someone."
Severus Snape's lips twisted. "I have seen enough disastrous
plotting, in my tenure as Head of Slytherin, to know how that
sometimes goes. If, in the future, all should come to light - then
at least I have told you, and you may say as much."</p>
<p>"Lovely," the boy said. "Thank you for clearing that up. Is that
all?"</p>
<p>"Do you intend to declare that your life is now a ruin and that
there is nothing left for you but vengeance?"</p>
<p>"No. I still have -" The boy cut himself off.</p>
<p>"Then there is very little advice that I can give you," said
Severus Snape.</p>
<p>The boy nodded distantly. "On Hermione's behalf, thank you for
helping her with the bullies. She would tell you that it was the
right thing to do. And now I would be much obliged if you could
tell them to <em>leave me alone</em>."</p>
<p>The Potions Master turned to the door, and when his face was
unseen, his voice came in a whisper. "I truly am sorry for your
loss."</p>
<p>Severus Snape departed.</p>
<p>The boy stared after him, trying to remember, as best as he
could at this distance, words which had been spoken some time
earlier.</p>
<p><em>Your books betrayed you, Potter. They did not tell you the
one thing you needed to know. You cannot learn from books what it
is like to lose the one you love. That is something you could never
know without experiencing it for yourself.</em></p>
<p>It had gone something like that, the boy thought, if he was
remembering correctly.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Hours had passed now, in the infirmary section with its closed
door and a body lying in state behind it.</p>
<p>Harry went on staring at his wand, as it lay in his lap. At the
tiny scratches and smudges on the eleven inches of holly, flaws
he'd never looked closely enough to notice before. A quick mental
calculation said there was no reason to worry since if this was six
or seven months' accumulation of damage, then a standard lifetime
wouldn't wear away the wand entirely. At the time, he probably
would've worried about his own Time-Turner being taken away if he'd
just openly yelled out 'Does anyone have a Time-Turner?' into the
Great Hall, but it would have been easy enough to precommit to,
after lunch, finding someone to send Professor Flitwick a message
two hours earlier and then Professor Flitwick could've just gone
straight to Hermione, or sent her his raven Patronus, long before
the troll was anywhere near her. Or might that alternate Harry have
already learned it was too late - heard about Hermione's death
after lunch and before he could buy any messages sent backwards in
time? Maybe a basic guideline of working with time-travel was to
make sure you never risked learning you were too late, if you
hadn't yet gone backwards. There was a tiny chemical burn now on
the end of his wand, presumably from contacting the acid he'd
partially Transfigured the troll's brain into, but the wand seemed
robust against losses of small amounts of wood. Really the concept
of a 'magic wand' being required just got stranger the more you
thought about it. Though if spells were always being invented in
some mysterious way, new rituals being carved as new levers upon
the unknown machine, it might just be that people just kept
inventing rituals that involved wands, just like they invented
phrases like 'Wingardium Leviosa'. It really seemed like magic
ought to be, in some sense, almost arbitrarily powerful, and it
certainly would be convenient if Harry could just bypass whatever
conceptual limitation prevented people from inventing spells like
'Just Fix Everything Forever', but somehow nothing was ever that
easy where magic was concerned. Harry looked at his mechanical
watch again, but it still wasn't time.</p>
<p>He'd attempted to cast the Patronus Charm, meaning to tell his
Patronus to go to Hermione Granger. Just in case it was all a lie,
a False Memory Charm or one of the who-knew-how-many-ways that
wizards could be made to close their eyes and dream. Just in case
the real Hermione was alive and being held somewhere, despite his
feeling her life as it left her. Just in case there was an
afterlife and the True Patronus could reach it.</p>
<p>The spell hadn't worked though, so that particular test had
failed to provide any evidence, leaving him with the previous,
unfavorable prior.</p>
<p>Time passed, and yet more time. From the outside you would've
just seen a boy, sitting, staring at his wand with an abstracted
gaze, looking at his watch every two minutes or so.</p>
<p>The door to the infirmary section opened once
<em>again</em>.</p>
<p>The boy sitting there looked up with a deadly, chilling
glare.</p>
<p>Then the boy's face cracked in dismay, and he scrambled to his
feet.</p>
<p>"Harry," said the man in the button-down formal shirt and a
black vest thrown over it. His voice was hoarse. "Harry, what's
happening? The Headmaster of your school - he showed up in those
ridiculous robes at my office and told me that Hermione Granger was
dead!"</p>
<p>A moment later a woman followed the man into the room; she
seemed less confused than the man, less bewildered and more
frightened.</p>
<p>"Dad," the boy said thinly. "Mum. Yes, she's dead. They didn't
tell you anything else?"</p>
<p>"No! Harry, what's happening?"</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>The boy slumped back against the wall. "I c-can't, I can't, I
can't do this."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"I can't pretend to be a little boy, I j-just don't have the
energy right now."</p>
<p>"Harry," the woman said falteringly. "Harry -"</p>
<p>"Dad, you know those fantasy books where the hero has to hide
everything from his parents because they, they wouldn't understand,
they'd react stupidly and get in the hero's way? It's a plot
device, right, so that the hero has to solve everything himself
instead of telling his parents. P-please don't be that plot device,
Dad, or you either, Mum. Just... just don't play that role. Don't
be the parents who won't understand. D-don't yell at me and give me
parental demands I can't follow. Because I've wandered into a
bloody stupid fantasy novel and now Hermione's - I j-just don't
have the energy to deal with it."</p>
<p>Slowly, as though his limbs were only half-animated, the man in
the black vest kneeled down to where Harry was standing, so that
his eyes were level with his son's. "Harry," the man said. "I need
you to tell me everything that has happened, right now."</p>
<p>The boy took a deep breath, swallowed. "They t-tell me the Dark
Lord I defeated may still be alive. Like that's not the p-plot of a
hundred sodding books, right? So, it could also be that the
Headmaster of my school, who's the most powerful wizard in the
world, has gone insane. And, and Hermione was framed for an
attempted murder just before this, not that anyone would've told
her parents about it or anything. The student she was framed for
attempted-murdering was the son of Lucius Malfoy, who's the most
powerful politician in magical Britain, and used to be the Dark
Lord's number two. The Defense Professor position at this school
has a curse on it, nobody ever lasts more than a year, they have a
saying that the Defense Professor is always a suspect. This year
the Defense Professor is secretly a mysterious wizard who opposed
the Dark Lord during the last war and may or may not be evil
himself. Also the Potions Master has been pining after Lily Potter
for years and might be behind this whole thing for some twisted
psychological reason." The boy's lips pressed together bitterly. "I
think that's most of the bloody stupid plot."</p>
<p>The man, who had listened to all this quietly, stood up. He put
a gentle hand on the boy's shoulder. "That's enough, Harry," he
said. "I've heard enough. We're leaving this school right now and
taking you with us."</p>
<p>The woman was looking at the boy, her face asking a
question.</p>
<p>The boy gazed back at her and nodded.</p>
<p>The woman's voice was thin when she spoke. "<em>They</em> won't
let us, Michael."</p>
<p>"They have no legal right to stop us -"</p>
<p>"<em>Right?</em> You're <em>Muggles,</em>" said the boy. He
smiled twistedly. "You have as much standing in the magical British
legal system as mice. No wizard is going to care about any
arguments you make about <em>rights,</em> about <em>fairness</em>,
they won't even take the time to listen. You don't have any
<em>power,</em> see, so they don't have to bother. No, Mum, I'm not
smiling like this because I agree with their Muggle policies, I'm
smiling because I disagree with your children policies."</p>
<p>"Then," Professor Michael Verres-Evans said firmly, "we shall
see what the <em>real</em> government has to say about that. I know
an MP or three -"</p>
<p>"They'll say, you're crazy, have a nice stay in this asylum.
That's assuming the Ministry Obliviators don't get to you first and
erase your memories. They do that to Muggles a lot, I hear. I
figure the real higher-ups in our government have formed some cozy
accomodations of their own. Maybe they get a few healing Charms now
and then, if someone important manages to get cancer." The boy gave
that twisted smile again. "And that's the situation, Dad, as Mum
already knows. They'd never have brought you here or told you
anything, if there was a single thing you could do about it."</p>
<p>The man's mouth opened but no words came out, as though he had
been reading from a script which described what a concerned parent
ought to do in this sort of situation, and this script had suddenly
arrived at a blank spot.</p>
<p>"Harry," the woman said falteringly.</p>
<p>The boy looked at her.</p>
<p>"Harry, did something happen to you? You seem...
different..."</p>
<p>"Petunia!" the man said, his tongue apparently working once
more. "Don't say such things! He's under stress, that's all."</p>
<p>"Well, Mum, you see -" The boy's voice cracked. "Are you sure
you want this all at once, Mum?"</p>
<p>The woman nodded, though she didn't speak.</p>
<p>"I've got... you know how that school psychiatrist thought I had
anger management problems? Well -" The boy stopped, and swallowed.
"I don't know how to explain this to you, Mum. It's something
magical instead. Probably something to do with whatever happened on
the night my parents died. I have... well, I was calling it a
mysterious dark side and I know it sounds like a joke and I
<em>did</em> check with... with an ancient telepathic magical hat
to make sure my scar wasn't <em>actually</em> inhabited by the Dark
Lord's spirit and it said that there was only one person under its
brim and I don't think wizards have actual souls anyway since they
can still suffer from brain damage, only -"</p>
<p>"Harry, slow down!" said the man.</p>
<p>"- only, only whatever it is, it's still <em>real,</em> there's
something inside me, it gave me willpower when things were bad, I
could face down anything so long as I was angry, Snape, Dumbledore,
the entire Wizengamot, my dark side wasn't afraid of anything but
Dementors. And I wasn't stupid, I knew that there might be a price
for using my dark side and I kept on looking to see what the price
might be. It didn't change my magic, it didn't seem to cause
permanent alignment shift, it didn't try to take me away from my
friends or anything like that, so I kept on using it whenever I had
to and I only figured out too late what the price really was -" The
boy's voice had become almost a whisper. "I only figured out
today... every time I call on it... it uses up my childhood. I
killed the thing that got Hermione. And it wasn't my dark side that
did it, it was me. Oh, Mum, Dad, I'm sorry."</p>
<p>There was a long silence filled with the sound of broken
masks.</p>
<p>"Harry," the man said, kneeling down again, "I need you to start
over from the beginning and explain that much more slowly."</p>
<p>The boy spoke.</p>
<p>The parents listened.</p>
<p>Some time later, the father stood up.</p>
<p>The boy looked up at him, grimacing in bitter anticipation.</p>
<p>"Harry," the man said, "Petunia and I are going to get you out
of here as quickly as possible -"</p>
<p>"Don't," the boy said warningly. "I mean it, Dad. The Ministry
of Magic isn't something you can stand up to. Pretend they're the
tax office or the dean or something else that won't brook any
challenge to their dominance. In magical Britain you're only
allowed to remember what the government thinks you should remember,
and remembering the existence of magic or that you have a son named
Harry is a privilege, not a right. And if they did that I'd crack
and turn the Ministry into a giant flaming crater. Mum, you know
the score, you absolutely have to stop Dad from trying anything
stupid."</p>
<p>"And son -" The man rubbed at his temples. "Maybe I shouldn't
say this now... but are you sure that what you're talking about is
really a magical dark side, and not something normal for a boy your
age?"</p>
<p>"Normal," the boy said with elaborate patience. "Normal how,
exactly? I could check again, but I'm reasonably sure there wasn't
anything about this in <em>Childcraft: A Guide For Parents.</em> My
dark side isn't just an emotional state, it <em>makes me
smarter.</em> In some ways, anyhow. You can't just <em>pretend</em>
yourself smarter."</p>
<p>The man rubbed at his head again. "Well... there's a certain
well-known phenomenon wherein children undergo a biological process
which can sometimes make them angry and dark and grim, and this
process also significantly increases their intelligence and their
height -"</p>
<p>The boy slumped back against the wall. "No, Dad, it's not that
I'm turning into a teenager. I checked with my brain and it still
thinks that girls are icky. But if that's what you want to pretend,
then fine. Maybe I'm better off with you not believing me. I just
-" The boy's voice choked. "I just couldn't stand lying about
it."</p>
<p>"Adolescence doesn't necessarily work like that, Harry. It may
still take a while for you to notice girls. If, in fact, you
haven't noticed one alrea-" and the man abruptly stopped.</p>
<p>"I didn't like Hermione in that way," the boy whispered. "Why
does everyone keep thinking it has to be about that? It's
disrespectful to her, to think someone could only like her in that
way."</p>
<p>The man swallowed visibly. "Anyway, son, you keep yourself safe
while we work on getting you out of here, is that understood? Don't
you go actually thinking that you've turned to the dark side. I
know you've had, ah, what I used to call your Ender Wiggin moments
-"</p>
<p>"I think we are now <em>well</em> past Ender and on to Ender
after the buggers kill Valentine."</p>
<p>"Language!" said the woman, and then her hand flew to cover her
mouth.</p>
<p>The boy spoke wearily. "Not that kind of bugger, Mum. They're
insectoid aliens - never mind."</p>
<p>"Harry, that's exactly what I'm saying you shouldn't think,"
Professor Verres-Evans said firmly. "You're not to go believing
that you're turning evil. You are not to hurt anyone, place
yourself in harm's way, or mess around with any sort of black magic
whatsoever, while your Mum and I work on extracting you from this
situation. Is that clear, son?"</p>
<p>The boy closed his eyes. "That'd be wonderful advice, Dad, if
only I were in a comic book."</p>
<p>"<em>Harry -</em>" the man began.</p>
<p>"Police can't do that. Soldiers can't do that. The most powerful
wizard in the world couldn't do that, and he tried. It's not fair
to the innocent bystanders to play at being Batman if you can't
actually protect everyone under that code. And I've just proven
that I can't."</p>
<p>Beads of sweat were glistening on Professor Michael
Verres-Evans's forehead. "Now you listen to me. No matter what
you've read in books, you aren't <em>supposed</em> to be protecting
anyone! Or involving yourself in anything dangerous! Absolutely
anything dangerous whatsoever! Just stay out of the way of
<em>everything,</em> every bit of craziness going on in this
madhouse, while we get you out of here the first instant we
possibly can!"</p>
<p>The boy looked searchingly at his father, then his mother. Then
he looked at his wristwatch again.</p>
<p>"Excellent point," said the boy.</p>
<p>The boy marched over to the door leading outward, and flung it
open.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The door flew open with a crack that caused Minerva to startle
where she stood, and before she had time to think, Harry Potter
marched out of the room, glaring directly at her.</p>
<p>"You brought my parents <em>here</em>," the Boy-Who-Lived said.
"To <em>Hogwarts.</em> Where You-Know-Who or <em>someone</em> is
lurking around, targeting my friends. What exactly were you
thinking?"</p>
<p>She did not reply that she had been thinking about Harry sitting
in front of the door to the storeroom containing Hermione's body,
refusing to move.</p>
<p>"Who else knows about this?" Harry Potter demanded. "Did anyone
see them with you?"</p>
<p>"The Headmaster brought them here -"</p>
<p>"I want them out of here <em>immediately</em> before anyone else
notices, especially You-Know-Who, but also including Professor
Quirrell or Professor Snape. Please send your Patronus to the
Headmaster and tell him that he needs to bring it back at once. Do
not mention my parents by name, or as people, in case somebody else
is listening."</p>
<p>"Indeed," said Professor Verres-Evans, nodding sternly along
with this from where he stood directly behind the boy, Petunia a
step behind him. His hand rested firmly on Harry's shoulder. "We'll
finish talking to our son at home."</p>
<p>"A moment, please," Minerva said in reflexive politeness. Her
first try at casting the Patronus failed, a disadvantage of that
Charm under certain circumstances. It wasn't the first time she'd
done it so, but she seemed to have lost some of the knack -</p>
<p>Minerva shut the thought down and concentrated.</p>
<p>When the message was sent, she turned back to Professor
Verres-Evans. "Sir," she said, "I'm afraid that Mr. Potter must not
leave the Hogwarts School -"</p>
<p>By the time Albus finally arrived, there was shouting, the
Muggle man having given up on dignity. At least there was shouting
on one side of the argument. Minerva's heart wasn't in it. The
truth was that she couldn't believe the words coming out of her
mouth.</p>
<p>When the Professor turned to argue with the Headmaster, Harry
Potter, who had remained silent through this, spoke up. "Not here,"
said Harry. "You can argue with him anywhere but Hogwarts, Dad.
Mum, please, please make sure that Dad doesn't try anything that
will get him in trouble with the Ministry."</p>
<p>Michael Verres-Evans's face screwed up. He turned, looked at
Harry Potter. When his voice came out it was hoarse, accompanied by
water in his eyes. "Son - what are you doing?"</p>
<p>"You know perfectly well what I'm doing," Harry Potter said.
"You read those comic books long before you gave them to me. I've
been through a bunch of crap, matured a bit, and now I'm protecting
my relatives. Actually, it's simpler than that, you know what I'm
doing because you tried to do the same thing. I'm having my loved
ones taken out of Hogwarts immediately, that's what I'm doing.
Headmaster, please get them out of here before You-Know-Who
discovers their presence and marks them for death."</p>
<p>Michael Verres-Evans began a frantic dash toward Harry, and then
all motion stopped with the Muggle man leaning forward in his
flight.</p>
<p>"I am sorry," the Headmaster said quietly. "We shall speak more
soon. Minerva, I was with the others when you called, they are
waiting in your office."</p>
<p>The Headmaster passed forwards like he was gliding, until he
stood in the midst of where the man and woman stood frozen; and
there was another flash of flame.</p>
<p>Motion resumed.</p>
<p>Minerva looked at Harry.</p>
<p>Words did not come to her.</p>
<p>"Clever move, bringing them here," Harry Potter said. "Probably
damaged our relationship permanently. All I wanted was to be bloody
left alone until bloody dinnertime. Which," the boy looked at his
wristwatch, "it now is <em>anyway</em>. I'm going to go say goodbye
to Hermione by myself, which I promise will take less than two
minutes, and then after that I'll come out and go eat something
like I would have done regardless. Do <em>not</em> disturb me for
those two bloody minutes or I will snap and try to kill someone, I
mean it, Professor."</p>
<p>The boy turned and strode into the small room, opened the rear
door to where Hermione Granger's body was being kept, and strode
inside before she could think to speak. Through the doorway she saw
a flash of a sight she knew no child ought to see -</p>
<p>The door slammed shut.</p>
<p>She started forwards, unthinking.</p>
<p>Halfway to the door, she stopped herself.</p>
<p>Her mind was still slow, and hurting, and the part of her that
Harry Potter would have called <em>the picture of a stern
disciplinarian</em> was lifelessly mouthing words about
inappropriate behavior from children. The rest of her didn't think
it was a good idea to leave any child, even Harry Potter, alone in
a room with the bloody corpse of his best friend. But the act of
opening the door, or asserting any sort of authority, did not seem
to her wise. There was no right thing to do, and no right thing to
say; or if there was any right path, she did not know it.</p>
<p>Very slowly, a minute and a half passed.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>When the door opened again, Harry seemed to have changed, as
though that minute and a half had passed over the course of
lifetimes.</p>
<p>"Seal up the room," Harry said quietly, "and let's go, Professor
McGonagall."</p>
<p>She walked over to the storeroom door. She wasn't quite able to
stop herself from looking in, and saw the dried blood, the sheet
covering the lower half, the upper body waxy and doll-like, and a
glimpse of Hermione Granger's closed eyes. Something inside her
began its weeping all over again.</p>
<p>She closed the door.</p>
<p>Her fingers moved upon her wand, her mouth spoke words without
thought, Charms and wards to seal the room against entry.</p>
<p>"Professor McGonagall," Harry said in a strange voice, as if by
rote, "do you have the rock? The rock that the Headmaster gave me?
I should Transfigure it into a jewel again, since it did prove
useful."</p>
<p>Automatically her eyes went to the ring on Harry's left pinky
finger, noting the emptiness of the setting where the jewel should
have been. "I shall mention it to the Headmaster," her tongue
replied.</p>
<p>"Is that a usual tactic, by the way?" Harry said, voice still
odd. "Carrying something large Transfigured into something small to
use as a weapon? Or is that a usual exercise for Transfiguration
practice?"</p>
<p>Distantly, she shook her head.</p>
<p>"Well, let's go, then."</p>
<p>"I have -" her voice stopped. "I'm afraid I have something else
which I must do, now. Will you be all right on your own, and will
you promise to go to the Great Hall directly and eat something, Mr.
Potter?"</p>
<p>The boy promised (barring exceptional and unforeseen
circumstances, a clause with which she did not argue) and then
walked out of the room.</p>
<p>What lay ahead of her... would be no easier, certainly, and
might well be harder.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Minerva walked to her office at a swift pace; not slowly, for
that would have been a discourtesy.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall opened the door to her office.</p>
<p>"Madam Granger," her voice said, "Mr. Granger, I am so terribly
sorry for -"</p>
</div>
<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 90: Roles, Pt 1<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>A simple <em>Innervate</em> from the Headmaster had awakened
Fred Weasley, followed by a preliminary healing Charm for a broken
arm and cracked ribs. Harry's voice had distantly told the
Headmaster about the Transfigured acid inside the troll's head
(Dumbledore had looked down over the side of the terrace and made a
gesture before returning) and then about the Weasley twins' minds
having been tampered with, carrying on a separate conversation that
Harry remembered but could not process.</p>
<p>Harry still stood over Hermione's body, he hadn't moved from
that spot, thinking as fast as he could through the sense of
dissociation and fragmented time, was there anything he should be
doing <em>now,</em> any opportunities that were passing
irrevocably. Some way to reduce the amount of magical omnipotence
that would be required later. A temporal beacon effect to mark this
instant for later time travel, if he someday found a way to travel
back further than six hours. There were theories of time travel
under General Relativity (which had seemed much less plausible
before Harry had run across Time-Turners) and those theories said
you couldn't go back to before the time machine was built - a
relativistic time machine maintained a continuous pathway through
time, it didn't teleport anything. But Harry didn't see anything
helpful he could do using spells in his lexicon, Dumbledore wasn't
being very cooperative, and in any case this was several minutes
after the critical location within Time</p>
<p>"Harry," the Headmaster whispered, laying his hand on Harry's
shoulder. He had vanished from where he was standing over the
Weasley twins and come into existence beside Harry; George Weasley
had discontinously teleported from where he was sitting to be
kneeling next to his brother's side, and Fred was now lying
straight with his eyes open and wincing as he breathed. "Harry, you
must go from this place."</p>
<p>"Hold on," said Harry's voice. "I'm trying to think if there's
anything else I can do."</p>
<p>The old wizard's voice sounded helpless. "Harry - I know you do
not believe in souls - but whether Hermione is watching you now, or
no, I do not think she would wish for you to be like this."</p>
<p>...no, it was obvious.</p>
<p>Harry leveled his wand at Hermione's body -</p>
<p>"Harry! What are you -"</p>
<p>- and poured <em>everything</em> down his arm into his hand
-</p>
<p><em>"Frigideiro!"</em></p>
<p>"- doing?"</p>
<p>"Hypothermia," Harry said distantly, as he staggered. It'd been
one of the spells he and Hermione had experimented on, a lifetime
ago, so he was able to control it precisely, though it had taken a
lot of power to affect that much mass. Hermione's body should now
be at almost exactly five degrees Celsius. "People have been
revived from cold water after more than thirty minutes without
breathing. The cold protects you from brain damage, you see, it
slows everything down. There's a saying Muggle doctors have, you're
not dead until you're warm and dead - I think they even cool down
the patient during some surgeries, if they have to stop someone's
heart for a while."</p>
<p>Fred and George started sobbing.</p>
<p>Dumbledore's face was already streaked with tears. "I'm sorry,"
he whispered. "Harry, I'm so sorry, but you have to stop this." The
Headmaster took Harry by the shoulders and pulled on him.</p>
<p>Harry allowed himself to be turned away from Hermione's body,
walked forward as the Headmaster pushed him away from the blood.
The Cooling Charm would buy him time. Hours at least, maybe days if
he could manage to keep casting the spell on Hermione or if they
stored her body somewhere cold.</p>
<p>Now there was time to think.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Minerva had seen Albus's face and she'd known something was
wrong; there had been time for her to wonder what had happened, and
even who had died; her mind flashing to Alastor, to Augusta, to
Arthur and Molly, all the most likely targets at the start of
Voldemort's second rise. She had thought that she had steeled
herself, she had thought herself ready for the worst.</p>
<p>Then Albus spoke, and all the steel left her.</p>
<p><em>Not Hermione - no -</em></p>
<p>Albus gave her a brief space to weep; and then told her that
Harry Potter, who had watched Miss Granger die, had seated himself
outside the infirmary storeroom where Miss Granger's remains were
being kept, refusing to move from the spot, and telling anyone who
spoke to him to go away so he could think.</p>
<p>The only thing that had elicited any reaction from the boy was
when Fawkes had tried to sing to him; Harry Potter had shrieked at
the phoenix not to do that, his feelings were real, he didn't want
magic trying to <em>heal</em> them like they were a disease. After
that Fawkes had refused to sing again.</p>
<p>Albus thought that she might have the best chance of reaching
Harry Potter now.</p>
<p>So she had to pull herself together, and clean up her face;
there would be time later for private grief, when her surviving
children no longer needed her.</p>
<p>Minerva McGonagall pulled together the dislocated pieces of
herself, wiped her eyes a final time, and laid her hand on the
doorknob of the infirmary section whose back storeroom was now
being used, for the second time this century and for the fifth time
since the castle of Hogwarts had been raised, as the resting place
of a promising young student.</p>
<p>She opened the door.</p>
<p>Harry Potter's eyes gazed at her. The boy was sitting on the
floor in front of the door to the back storeroom, and holding his
wand in his lap. If those eyes were grieving, if they were empty,
if they were even broken, it couldn't be seen from looking at the
boy's face. There were no dried tears on those cheeks.</p>
<p>"Why are you here, Professor McGonagall?" Harry Potter said. "I
told the Headmaster I'd like to be left alone for a while."</p>
<p>She couldn't think of anything to say. <em>To help you - you're
not all right -</em> but she didn't know what to say, there was
nothing she could imagine saying that would make things better. She
hadn't planned ahead before she'd walked into the room, having not
been at her best.</p>
<p>"What are you thinking about?" Minerva said. It was the only
sentence that came into her mind. Albus had told her that Harry had
been saying, over and over, that he was thinking; and she had to
get Harry talking, somehow.</p>
<p>Harry stared half at her and half past her, a tension coming
into his face, as she held her breath.</p>
<p>It took a while before Harry spoke.</p>
<p>"I'm trying to think if there's anything I should be doing right
now," said Harry Potter. "It's hard, though. My mind keeps on
imagining ways the past could have gone differently if I'd thought
faster, and I can't rule out that there might be a key insight in
there somewhere."</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter -" she said falteringly. "Harry, I don't think it's
healthy for you to be - thinking like that -"</p>
<p>"I disagree. It's not thinking that gets people killed." The
words were spoken in a level monotone, as though reciting lines
from a book.</p>
<p>"Harry," she said, hardly even thinking as she said it, "there's
nothing you could have done -"</p>
<p>Something flickered in Harry's expression. His eyes seemed to
focus on her for the first time.</p>
<p>"Nothing I could have <em>done?</em> " Harry's voice rose on the
last word. <em>"Nothing I could have DONE? I've lost track of how
many different ways I could've saved her! If I'd asked to have us
all given communications mirrors! If I'd insisted on Hermione being
taken out of Hogwarts and put in a school that isn't insane! If I'd
snuck out immediately instead of trying to argue with normal
people! If I'd remembered the Patronus earlier! If I'd thought
through possible emergencies and trained myself to think about
Patronuses earlier! Even at the very last minute it might not have
been too late! I killed the troll and turned to her and she was
still ALIVE and I just knelt next to her listening to her last
words like an IDIOT instead of casting the Patronus again and
calling Dumbledore to send Fawkes!</em> Or if I'd just approached
the whole problem from a different angle - if I'd looked for a
student with a Time-Turner to send a message back in time
<em>before</em> I found out about anything happening to her,
instead of ending up with an outcome that can't be altered - I
<em>asked</em> the Headmaster to go back and save Hermione and then
fake everything, fake the dead body, edit everyone's memories, but
Dumbledore said that he tried something like that once and it
didn't work and he lost another friend instead. Or if I'd - if I'd
only gone with - if, that night -"</p>
<p>Harry pressed his hands over his face, and when he removed them
again, his face was calm and composed once more.</p>
<p>"Anyway," said Harry Potter, now in a monotone again, "I don't
want to repeat that mistake, so I'm going to spend until dinnertime
thinking if there's anything I should be doing. If I haven't
thought of anything by then I'll go to dinner and eat. Now please
go away."</p>
<p>She was aware now that tears were sliding down her cheeks,
again. "Harry - Harry, you have to believe that this isn't your
fault!"</p>
<p>"Of course it's my fault. There's no one else here who could be
responsible for anything."</p>
<p>"No! You-Know-Who killed Hermione!" She was hardly aware of what
she was saying, that she hadn't screened the room against who might
be listening. "Not you! No matter what else you could've done, it's
not you who killed her, it was Voldemort! If you can't believe that
you'll go mad, Harry!"</p>
<p>"That's not how responsibility works, Professor." Harry's voice
was patient, like he was explaining things to a child who was
certain not to understand. He wasn't looking at her anymore, just
staring off at the wall to her right side. "When you do a fault
analysis, there's no point in assigning fault to a part of the
system you can't change afterward, it's like stepping off a cliff
and blaming gravity. Gravity isn't going to change next time.
There's no point in trying to allocate responsibility to people who
aren't going to alter their actions. Once you look at it from that
perspective, you realize that allocating blame never helps anything
unless you blame yourself, because you're the only one whose
actions you can change by putting blame there. That's why
Dumbledore has his room full of broken wands. He understands that
part, at least."</p>
<p>Some distant part of her mind made a note to wait until much
later and then speak sharply to the Headmaster about what he was
showing to impressionable young children. She might even scream at
him this time. She'd been thinking about screaming at him anyway,
because of Miss Granger -</p>
<p>"You're <em>not</em> responsible," she said, though her voice
trembled. "It's the Professors - it's us who are responsible for
student safety, not you."</p>
<p>Harry's eyes flicked back to her. "<em>You're</em> responsible?"
There was a tightness in the voice. "You want me to hold you
responsible, Professor McGonagall?"</p>
<p>She raised her chin and nodded. It would be better, by far, than
Harry blaming himself.</p>
<p>The boy pushed himself up from where he was sitting on the
floor, and took a step forward. "All right, then," Harry said in a
monotone. "I tried to do the sensible thing, when I saw Hermione
was missing and that none of the Professors knew. I asked for a
seventh-year student to go with me on a broomstick and protect me
while we looked for Hermione. I asked for help. I begged for help.
And nobody helped me. Because you gave everyone an absolute order
to stay in one place or they'd be expelled, no excuses. No matter
what else Dumbledore gets wrong, he at least thinks of his students
as people, not animals that have to be herded into a pen and kept
from wandering out. You knew you weren't any good at military
thinking, your first idea was to have us walking through the
hallways, you knew some students there were better than you at
strategy and tactics, and you still nailed us down in one room
without any discretionary judgment. So when something you didn't
foresee happened and it would've made perfect sense to send out a
seventh-year student on a fast broom to look for Hermione Granger,
the students knew you wouldn't understand or forgive. They weren't
afraid of the troll, they were afraid of you. The discipline, the
conformity, the <em>cowardice</em> that you instilled in them
delayed me just long enough for Hermione to die. Not that I
should've tried asking for help from normal people, of course, and
I will change and be less stupid next time. But if I were dumb
enough to allocate responsibility to someone who isn't me, that's
what I'd say."</p>
<p>Tears were streaming down her cheeks.</p>
<p>"That's what I'd tell you if I thought you could be responsible
for anything. But normal people don't choose on the basis of
consequences, they just play roles. There's a picture in your head
of a stern disciplinarian and you do whatever that picture would
do, whether or not it makes any sense. A stern disciplinarian would
order the students back to their rooms, even if there was a troll
roaming the hallways. A stern disciplinarian would order students
not to leave the Hall on pain of expulsion. And the little picture
of Professor McGonagall that you have in your head can't learn from
experience or change herself, so there isn't any point to this
conversation. People like you aren't responsible for anything,
people like me are, and when we fail there's no one else to
blame."</p>
<p>The boy strode forward to stand directly before her. His hand
darted beneath his robes, brought forth the golden sphere that was
the Ministry-issued protective shell of his Time Turner. He spoke
in a dead, level voice without any emphasis. "This could've saved
Hermione, if I'd been able to use it. But you thought it was your
role to shut me down and get in my way. Nobody has died in Hogwarts
in fifty years, you said that when you locked it, do you remember?
I should've asked again after Bellatrix Black got loose from
Azkaban, or after Hermione got framed for attempted murder. But I
forgot because I was stupid. Please unlock it now before any of my
other friends die."</p>
<p>Unable to speak, she brought forth her wand and did so,
releasing the time-keyed enchantment she'd laced into the shell's
lock.</p>
<p>Harry Potter flipped open the golden shell, looked at the tiny
glass hourglass within its circles, nodded, and then snapped the
case shut. "Thank you. Now go away." The boy's voice cracked again.
"I have to think."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>She closed the door behind her, an awful and still
mostly-muffled sound escaping her throat -</p>
<p>Albus shimmered into existence beside her, taking on a brief
garish hue as the Disillusionment wore off.</p>
<p>She did not jump, quite. "I've told you, stop doing that,"
Minerva said. Her voice sounded dull in her own ears. "That was
private."</p>
<p>Albus flickered his fingers at the door behind her. "I was
afraid Mr. Potter might do you some harm." The Headmaster paused,
then said quietly, "I am very surprised that you stood there and
took that."</p>
<p>"All I had to do was say 'Mr. Potter', and he would have
stopped." Her voice had dropped almost to a whisper. "Just that,
and he would have stopped. And then he would have had no one to say
those awful things to, no one at all."</p>
<p>"I thought Mr. Potter's remarks were entirely unfair and
undeserved," Albus said.</p>
<p>"If it had been you, Albus, you would not have threatened to
expel anyone leaving the room. Can you honestly tell me
otherwise?"</p>
<p>Albus's brows rose. "Your role in this disaster was tiny, your
decisions quite sensible at the time, and it is only Harry Potter's
perfect hindsight that lets him imagine otherwise. Surely you are
wiser than to blame yourself for this, Minerva."</p>
<p>She knew perfectly well that Albus would be placing a picture of
Hermione in that awful room of his, that it would occupy a place of
honor. Albus would hold <em>himself</em> responsible, she was
certain, even though he hadn't even been in Hogwarts at the time.
But not her.</p>
<p><em>So you also don't think it's worth the trouble of holding me
responsible...</em></p>
<p>She slumped against the nearest wall, trying not to let the
tears emerge again; she'd never seen Albus weep save thrice. "You
have always believed in your students, as I never have. They would
not have been afraid of you. They would have known you would
understand."</p>
<p>"Minerva -"</p>
<p>"I am not fit to succeed you as Headmistress. We both know
it."</p>
<p>"You are wrong," Albus said quietly. "When the time comes, you
will be the forty-fifth Headmistress of Hogwarts and you will do an
excellent job of it."</p>
<p>She shook her head. "What now, Albus? If he will not listen to
me, then who?"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>It was perhaps half an hour later. The boy still guarded the
door to where his best friend's body lay, sitting his vigil. He was
staring downward, at his wand as it lay in his hands. Sometimes his
face screwed up in thought, at other times it relaxed.</p>
<p>Although the door did not open, and there was no sound, the boy
looked up. He composed his face. His voice, when he spoke, was
dull. "I don't want company."</p>
<p>The door opened.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor of Hogwarts entered into the room and shut
the door behind him, taking up careful position in a corner between
two walls, as far away from the boy as the room permitted. A sharp
sense of catastrophe had risen in the air between the two of them,
and hung there unchanging.</p>
<p>"Why are you here?" said the boy.</p>
<p>The man tilted his head slightly. Pale eyes examined the boy as
though he were a specimen of life from a distant planet, and
correspondingly dangerous.</p>
<p>"I've come to apologize, Mr. Potter," the man said quietly.</p>
<p>"Apologize for what?" the boy said. "Why, what could
<em>you</em> have done to prevent Hermione's death?"</p>
<p>"I should have thought to check for the presence of yourself,
Mr. Longbottom, and Miss Granger, all of whom were obvious next
targets," the Defense Professor said without hesitation. "Mr.
Hagrid was not mentally equipped to command the student contingent.
I should have ignored the Deputy Headmistress's request for
silence, and told her to leave behind Professor Flitwick, who would
have been better able to defend the students from any threat, and
who could have maintained communication via Patronus."</p>
<p>"Correct." The boy's voice was razor-sharp. "I'd forgotten there
was someone else in Hogwarts who could be responsible for things.
So why didn't you think of it, Professor? Because I don't believe
that <em>you</em> were stupid."</p>
<p>There was a pause, and the boy's fingers whitened on his
wand.</p>
<p>"You did not think of it either, Mr. Potter, at the time." There
was a weariness in the Defense Professor's voice. "I am smarter
than you. I think faster than you. I am more experienced than you.
But the gap between the two of us is not the same as the gap
between us and them. If you can miss something, then so can I." The
man's lips twisted. "You see, I deduced at once that the troll was
but a distraction from some other matter, and of no great
importance in itself. So long as nobody sent the students wandering
pointlessly through the halls, or uncaringly dispatched the young
Slytherins to those very dungeons where the troll had been
spotted."</p>
<p>The boy did not seem to relax. "I suppose that is
plausible."</p>
<p>"In any case," said the man, "if there is anyone who can be said
to be responsible for Miss Granger's death, it is myself, not you.
It is I, not you, who should have -"</p>
<p>"I perceive that you have spoken to Professor McGonagall and
that she has given you a script to follow." The boy did not bother
keeping the bitterness from his voice. "If you have something to
say to me, Professor, say it without the masks."</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>"As you wish," the Defense Professor said emotionlessly. The
pale eyes stayed keen and sharp. "I do regret that the girl is
dead. She was a good student in my Defense class, and could have
been an ally to you later. I would wish to console you for your
loss, but I cannot see how to go about doing so. Naturally, if I
find the ones responsible I shall kill them. You are welcome to
join in should circumstances permit."</p>
<p>"How touching," the boy said, his voice cool. "You are not
claiming to have liked Hermione, then?"</p>
<p>"Her charms were lost on me, I suspect. I no longer form such
bonds easily."</p>
<p>The boy nodded. "Thank you for being honest. Is that all,
Professor?"</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>"The castle is scarred, now," said the man standing in the
corner.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"When a certain ancient device in my possession informed me that
Miss Granger was on the verge of death, I cast that spell of cursed
fire of which I once spoke. I burned through some walls and floors
so that my broomstick could take a more direct path." The man still
spoke tonelessly. "Hogwarts will not heal such wounds easily, if at
all. I suppose it will be necessary to patch over the holes with
lesser conjurations. I regret that now, since I was in any case too
late."</p>
<p>"Ah," said the boy. He closed his eyes briefly. "You did want to
save her. You wanted it so strongly that you made some sort of
actual effort. I suppose your mind, if not theirs, would be capable
of that."</p>
<p>A brief, dry smile from the man.</p>
<p>"Thank you for that, Professor. But I would like to be left
alone now until dinnertime. You of all people will understand. Is
that all?"</p>
<p>"Not quite," the man said. A tinge of sardonic dryness now
returned to his voice. "You see, based on recent experiences, I am
concerned that you may now intend to do something extremely
foolish."</p>
<p>"Such as what?" said the boy.</p>
<p>"I am not quite sure. Perhaps you have decided that a universe
without Miss Granger is devoid of value, and should be destroyed
for the insults it has dealt you."</p>
<p>The boy smiled without any humor. "Your own issues are showing,
Professor. I don't really go in for that sort of thing. Did you, at
some point?"</p>
<p>"Not particularly. I have no great fondness for the universe,
but I do live there."</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>"What are you planning, Mr. Potter?" said the man in the corner.
"You have come to some significant resolution, though you are
trying to hide it from me. What do you now intend?"</p>
<p>The boy shook his head. "I'm still thinking, and would like to
be left alone to do it."</p>
<p>"I recall an offer you once made to me, some months ago," said
the Defense Professor. "Do you want someone intelligent to talk to?
I will understand if you are not pleasant to be around."</p>
<p>The boy shook his head again. "No, thank you."</p>
<p>"Well, then," said the Defense Professor. "What about someone
who is powerful and not particularly bound by naive scruples?"</p>
<p>There was a hesitation, and then the boy once more shook his
head.</p>
<p>"Someone who is knowledgeable of much secret lore, and magics
that some might consider to be unnatural?"</p>
<p>There was a slight narrowing of the boy's eyes, so imperceptible
that someone else might not have -</p>
<p>"I see," said the Defense Professor. "Go ahead and ask me about
it, then. I give you my word that I will repeat nothing of it to
the others."</p>
<p>The boy took a while to speak, and when he did it was in a
cracked voice.</p>
<p>"I mean to bring Hermione back. Because there isn't an
afterlife, and I'm not about to just let her - just <em>not be</em>
-"</p>
<p>The boy pressed his hands over his face, and when he withdrew
them, he once more seemed as dispassionate as the man standing in
the corner.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor's eyes were abstract, and faintly
puzzled.</p>
<p>"How?" the man said finally.</p>
<p>"However I have to."</p>
<p>There was another pause.</p>
<p>"Regardless of the risks," the man in the corner said.
"Regardless of how dangerous the magic required to accomplish
it."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor's eyes were thoughtful. "But what general
approach did you have in mind? I presume that turning her corpse
into an Inferius is not what you -"</p>
<p>"Would she be able to think?" the boy said. "Would her body
still decay?"</p>
<p>"No, and yes."</p>
<p>"Then no."</p>
<p>"What of the Resurrection Stone of Cadmus Peverell, if it could
be obtained for you?"</p>
<p>The boy shook his head. "I don't want an illusion of Hermione
drawn from my memories. I want her to be able to <em>live</em> her
<em>life -</em>" the boy's voice cracked. "I haven't decided yet on
an object-level angle of attack. If I have to brute-force the
problem by acquiring enough power and knowledge to just <em>make it
happen</em>, I will."</p>
<p>Another pause.</p>
<p>"And to go about <em>that,</em>" the man in the corner said,
"you will use your favorite tool, science."</p>
<p>"Of course."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor exhaled, almost like a sigh. "I suppose
that makes sense of it."</p>
<p>"Are you willing to help, or not?" the boy said.</p>
<p>"What help do you seek?"</p>
<p>"Magic. Where does it come from?"</p>
<p>"I do not know," said the man.</p>
<p>"And neither does anyone else?"</p>
<p>"Oh, the situation is far worse than that, Mr. Potter. There is
hardly a scholar of the esoteric who has not unraveled the nature
of magic, and every one of them believes something different."</p>
<p>"Where do new spells come from? I keep reading about someone who
invented a spell to do something-or-other but there's no mention of
<em>how</em>."</p>
<p>A shrug of robed shoulders. "Where do new books come from, Mr.
Potter? Those who read many books sometimes become able to write
them in turn. How? No one knows."</p>
<p>"There are books on how to write -"</p>
<p>"Reading them will not make you a famous playwright. After all
such advice is accounted for, what remains is mystery. The
invention of new spells is a similar mystery of purer form." The
man's head tilted. "Such endeavors are dangerous. The saying is
that one should either not have children, or else wait until after
they are grown. There is a reason why so many innovators seem to
hail from Gryffindor, rather than Ravenclaw as might be
expected."</p>
<p>"And the more powerful sorts of magics?" the boy said.</p>
<p>"A legendary wizard might invent one sacrificial ritual in his
life, and pass on the knowledge to his heirs. To try inventing five
such would be suicide. That is why wizards of true power are those
who have acquired ancient lore."</p>
<p>The boy nodded distantly. "So much for the direct solution,
then. It would've been nice to just invent a spell for 'Raise
Dead', 'Become God' or 'Summon Terminal'. Do you know anything
about Atlantis?"</p>
<p>"Only what any scholar knows," the man said dryly. "If you would
like to hear about the top eighteen standard theories - do not
glare at me, Mr. Potter. If it were that simple, I would have done
it many years earlier."</p>
<p>"I understand. Sorry."</p>
<p>There was a time of silence. The Defense Professor's gaze rested
on the boy, the boy stared off seemingly at nothing.</p>
<p>"There's some magics I mean to learn. Spells I could've used
earlier today, if I'd thought to study them beforehand." The boy's
voice was cold. "Spells I'll need, if this sort of thing goes on
happening. Most I expect I can just look up. Some I expect I
can't."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor inclined his head. "I shall teach you
almost any magic you wish to know, Mr. Potter. I do have some
limits, but you may always ask. But what specifically do you seek?
You lack the raw power for the Killing Curse and most other spells
deemed forbidden -"</p>
<p>"That spell of cursed fire. I don't suppose it's a sacrificial
ritual that even a child could use, if he dared?"</p>
<p>The Defense Professor's lips twitched. "It requires the
permanent sacrifice of a drop of blood; your body would be lighter
by that drop of blood, from that day forward. Not the sort of thing
one would wish to do often, Mr. Potter. Strength of will is
demanded for the cursed fire not to turn upon you and consume you;
the usual practice is to first test one's will in lesser trials.
And although it is not a primary element of the ritual, I am afraid
that it does require more magic than you shall possess for another
few years."</p>
<p>"Pity," the boy said. "It would've been nice to see the look on
the enemy's face the next time they tried using a troll."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor inclined his head, his lips twitching
again.</p>
<p>"What about Memory Charms? The Weasley twins were acting oddly
and the Headmaster said he thinks they've been Obliviated. It seems
to be one of the enemy's favorite tricks."</p>
<p>"Rule Eight," said the Defense Professor. "Any technique which
is good enough to defeat me once is good enough to learn
myself."</p>
<p>The boy smiled humorlessly. "And I once heard about an adult
casting Obliviate while she was almost completely drained, so it
must not take too much magic to cast. It's not even considered
Unforgiveable, though I can't imagine why not. If I could've made
Mr. Hagrid remember a different set of orders -"</p>
<p>"It is not that straightforward," said the Defense Professor.
"You are not powerful enough to use the False Memory Charm, and
even a simple Obliviation will stretch the edge of your current
stamina. It is a dangerous art, illegal to use without Ministry
authorization, and I would caution you not to use it under
circumstances where it would be inconvenient to accidentally erase
ten years of someone's life. I wish I could promise you that I
would obtain one of those highly guarded tomes from the Department
of Mysteries, and pass it to you beneath a disguised cover. But
what I must actually tell you is that you will find the standard
introductory text in the north-northwest stacks of the main
Hogwarts library, filed under M."</p>
<p>"Seriously," the boy said flatly.</p>
<p>"Indeed."</p>
<p>"Thank you for your guidance, Professor."</p>
<p>"Your creativity has become a great deal more practical, Mr.
Potter, since I have known you."</p>
<p>"Thank you for the compliment." The boy did not look up from
where he was again gazing down at the wand held between his hands.
"I would like to go back to thinking now. Please explain to them on
my behalf what happens if I am disturbed."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The door to the storeroom clicked open, and Professor Quirrell
stepped out. His face had a dead, emotionless look to it; she would
have said that it reminded her of Severus, though Severus had never
looked quite like that.</p>
<p>Even as the door clicked shut again, Minerva had thrown up a
wordless Quieting barrier. The words spilled forth from her
rapidly: "How did it go - you were in there for a while - is Harry
talking now?"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell paced swiftly across the room to the far wall
near the entrance, looked back at her. The emotionlessness slid off
his face, as though he were taking off a mask, leaving behind
someone very grim. "I spoke to Mr. Potter as he expected me to
speak, and avoided saying things that would annoy him. I do not
think it consoled him. I do not think I have the knack."</p>
<p>"Thank you - it is good that he spoke at all -" She hesitated.
"What did Mr. Potter say?"</p>
<p>"I am afraid that I promised him not to speak of it. And now...
I think that I must visit the Hogwarts library."</p>
<p>"The <em>library?</em> "</p>
<p>"Yes," Professor Quirrell said. An uncharacteristic tension had
come into his voice. "I intend to strengthen the security upon the
Restricted Section with certain precautions of my own devising. The
current wards are a joke. And Mr. Potter must be kept out of the
Restricted Section <em>at all costs.</em>"</p>
<p>She stared at the Defense Professor, her heart suddenly in her
throat.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell continued speaking. "You will <em>not</em>
tell the boy that I have said this much to you. You will confirm to
Flitwick and Vector that the boy is to be diverted by the usual
evasions if he asks precocious questions about spell creation. And
though it is not my own area of expertise, Deputy Headmistress, if
there is any way you can imagine to convince the boy to stop
sinking further into his grief and madness - any way at all to undo
the resolutions he is coming to - then I suggest you resort to it
<em>immediately</em>."</p>

<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 93: Roles, Pt 4<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>Harry had walked into the Great Hall, looked around only once,
grabbed enough calories to sustain himself, walked out, put on his
Cloak again and found a small random corner in which to eat. Seeing
the students at their tables -</p>
<p><em>Feeling revulsion when you look at other humans is not a
good sign,</em> Hufflepuff said. <em>It's not reasonable to blame
them for having not had your opportunities to learn what you've
learned. Inaction in emergencies has nothing to do with people
being selfish. Normalcy bias, like that plane crash in
Tener-something where a few people ran out and escaped but most
people just sat in their seats not moving while their plane was
literally on fire. Look at how long</em> you <em>took to really
start moving.</em></p>
<p><em>It serves no useful purpose to hate</em>, said Gryffindor.
<em>It's just going to damage your altruism.</em></p>
<p><em>Try to figure out a training method you could use to prevent
this from happening next time,</em> said Ravenclaw.</p>
<p><em>I'll go ahead and register the experimental prediction,</em>
said Slytherin, <em>that we'll always observe exactly what would be
predicted on the hypothesis that people cannot be saved, cannot be
taught, and will never help us with anything important. Also, we
need some way of keeping track of all the times I'm right.</em></p>
<p>Harry ignored the voices in his head and just ate slices of
toast as fast as he could. It wasn't proper nutrition as a general
policy, but one-time exceptions wouldn't hurt so long as he made
them up the next day.</p>
<p>In mid-bite, the blazing silver silhouette of a phoenix flew in
from nowhere and said, in the voice of a tired old man, "Please
remove your Cloak, Harry, I have a letter to deliver to you."</p>
<p>Harry coughed for a bit, swallowed some toast which had gone
down the wrong way, stood up, took off the Cloak of Invisibility,
said aloud "Tell Dumbledore I said fine," and then sat down and
continued to eat his toast.</p>
<p>The toast had all gone by the time Albus Dumbledore walked up to
Harry's nook, carrying folded sheets of paper in his hand; real
paper, with lines, not wizard's parchment.</p>
<p>"Is that -" Harry said.</p>
<p>"From your father, and from your mother," said the old wizard.
Wordlessly, Dumbledore handed over the folded sheets, and
wordlessly Harry accepted them. The old wizard hesitated, then said
quietly, "The Defense Professor has told me to restrain my counsel,
and I thought the same thing myself when given time to think. I
have always taken too long to learn the virtues of silence. But if
I am mistaken, you need only say the word -"</p>
<p>"You're not mistaken," Harry said. He looked down at the folded,
lined papers, feeling the sickness in his gut that was how his body
indicated a strong pessimistic prediction. His parents wouldn't
actually disown him, and there wasn't much they could <em>do</em>
to him (some part of himself was still afraid in a very visceral
way of television privileges being taken away, no matter how little
sense that made now). But he had stepped outside the role that
parents would expect of children who, in their internal beliefs,
were lower on the pecking order. It would be stupid to expect
anything except complete indignant fury, all-out righteous rage,
when you acted like that to someone who thought they were dominant
over you.</p>
<p>"After you read it," the Headmaster said, "I believe that you
should come to the Great Hall at once, Harry. There is an
announcement which you will wish to hear."</p>
<p>"I'm not interested in funerals -"</p>
<p>"No. Not that. Please, Harry, come as soon as you are done
reading, and do so without your Cloak. Will you?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>The old wizard left.</p>
<p>Harry had to force himself to open up the letter. The important
thing was keeping your vulnerable friends and relations out of
harm's way, it might be a cliche but so far as Harry could tell the
logic was valid. Damaged relationships could be repaired later.</p>
<p>The first letter said, in script handwriting that required a
careful focus for Harry to read,</p>
<p><em>Son,</em></p>
<p><em>No matter what you've read in books, keeping us out of
harm's way is</em> <em>not</em> <em>as important as having adults
who can help when you're in trouble. You decided without giving us
a word in edgewise that we'd abandon you because of your 'dark
side'. The ghost of Shakespeare knows that I've seen things in this
last year that were not dreamt of in my philosophy - sometimes I
wonder if your Mum isn't just humoring me and the authorities took
you away when I started thinking you were a magic-user - so I can't
deny that it's</em> <em>possible</em> <em>you've managed to develop
some... I'm not quite sure what to call it, but 'dark side' seems
premature if we don't know what's happening. Are you sure it's not
a burgeoning telepathic talent and you're just picking up on the
minds of other wizards around you? Their thoughts might seem evil
to a child who grew up in a saner civilization. These are
ungrounded speculations, I admit, but you shouldn't jump to
conclusions either.</em></p>
<p><em>The two most important things I have to tell you are this.
First, son, I have</em> <em>every</em> <em>confidence in your
ability to stay on the Light Side of the Force so long as you
choose to, and I have every confidence that you will choose to. If
there's some evil spirit whispering horrible suggestions in your
ears, just ignore the suggestions. I</em> <em>do</em> <em>feel the
need to emphasize that you should exercise special caution to
ignore this evil spirit even if it is suggesting what seem like
wonderful creative ideas and I hope I do not need to remind you
about the Incident with the Science Project which would, I admit,
make a deal more sense if you were struggling with demonic
possession.</em></p>
<p><em>The second thing I have to say is that you do not need to
fear that Mum or I are going to abandon you because of your 'dark
side'. We may not have expected you to gain magical powers or
develop an affinity for black magic, but we did expect you to
become a teenager. Which, if you think about it from your poor
father's perspective, is already a sufficiently worrying prospect
regarding a child who, by the age of nine, had been party to the
summoning of a total of five fire engines. Children grow up. I
won't lie to you and say that you will feel as close to us at 20 as
you do now. But your Mum and I will feel just as close to you when
we are old and grey and bothering the nursing-home robots. Children
always grow up and away from their parents, and the parents always
follow them from behind, offering helpful advice. Children grow up,
and their personalities change, and they do things that their
parents wish they would not do, and they act disrespectfully toward
their parents and have them hauled out of their magical schools,
and the parents go on loving them anyway. It is Nature's way.
Though in the event that you have not yet hit puberty and your
teenage years are proportionately worse than this, we reserve the
right to reconsider this sentiment.</em></p>
<p><em>No matter what is happening, remember that we love you and
will always love you no matter what. I don't know if our love has
any magical power under your rules, but if it does, don't hesitate
to call on it.</em></p>
<p><em>With all of this said... Harry, what you did there is not
acceptable. I think you know that. And I also know that it is not
the time to lecture you on it. But you must write and tell us what
is happening. I can understand very well why you'd want us taken
out of your school at once, and I know we can't force you to do
anything, but please, Harry, be reasonable and realize how
terrified we must be.</em></p>
<p><em>I would like to tell you that you are absolutely forbidden
to mess around with any magic that the adults around you consider
the least bit unsafe, but for all I know, the teachers at your
school are giving everyone lessons in advanced necromancy every
Monday. Please, please exercise as much caution as your situation
permits, whatever your situation may be. Despite your very hurried
summary we don't have the slightest idea what is happening and I
hope that you will write us as much as you can. It is clear that
you are, at least in some ways, growing up, and I will</em>
<em>try</em> <em>not to act like the children's-book parent who
only makes things worse - though I hope you appreciate how hard
this is - and your Mum has said a number of frightening things to
me about how wizardry stays secret and how I might get</em>
<em>you</em> <em>into trouble by making waves. I cannot tell you to
avoid anything unsafe, because your school is unsafe and your
Headmaster will not let you leave. I can't tell you that you
shouldn't take responsibility for anything happening around you,
because for all I know there are other children in trouble. But
remember that it is</em> <em>not</em> <em>your moral responsibility
to protect any adults, their place is to protect you, and every
good adult would agree with that. Please write and tell us more as
soon as you can.</em></p>
<p><em>Both of us are desperate to help. If there is anything at
all that we can do, please let us know at once. There is nothing
which can happen to us which would be worse than learning that
something had happened to you.</em></p>
<p><em>Love,<br></em><em>Dad.</em><em><br></em></p>
<p>The last page said only,</p>
<p><em>You promised me that you wouldn't let magic take you away
from me. I didn't raise you to be a boy who would break a promise
to his Mum. You must come back safely, because you
promised.</em></p>
<p><em>Love,<br></em><em>Mum.</em><em><br></em></p>
<p>Slowly, Harry lowered the letters and began to walk towards the
Great Hall. His hands were shaking, his whole body was shaking, and
it seemed to be taking a very great deal of effort not to cry;
which he knew wordlessly that he must not do. He hadn't cried
through all of the day. And he wouldn't cry. Crying was the same as
admitting defeat. And this wasn't over. So he wouldn't cry.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The food served in the Great Hall that evening was plain that
night, toast and butter and jam, water and orange juice, oatmeal
and other simple fare, without dessert. Some students had worn
simple black robes without their House colors. Others had still
worn theirs. It should have been cause for argument, but there was
instead a quietness, the sound of people eating without talking. It
took two sides to make a debate, and one of the sides, this night,
was not much interested in debating.</p>
<p>Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall sat at the Head Table and
did not eat. She should have. Perhaps she would in a short while.
But she could not force herself to do it now.</p>
<p>For a Gryffindor there was only one path. It had taken Minerva
only a short time to remember that, when after the Defense
Professor's urgings her mind had stayed empty of clever plots to
try. That was not a Gryffindor's way; or perhaps she ought to say
only that it was not <em>her</em> way, Albus did seem to try his
hand at plotting... and yet when she thought back on their history,
there were no plots at the moment of crisis, no cleverness and
games in the last resort. For Albus Dumbledore, as for her, the
rule <em>in extremis</em> was to decide what was the right thing to
do, and do it no matter the cost to yourself. Even if it meant
breaking your bounds, or changing your role, or letting go of your
picture of yourself. That was the last resort of Gryffindor.</p>
<p>Through a side entrance of the Great Hall she saw Harry Potter
quietly slip in.</p>
<p>It was time.</p>
<p>Professor Minerva McGonagall rose from her chair, straightened
the worn point on her hat, walked slowly to the lectern before the
Head Table.</p>
<p>The sounds in the Great Hall, already muted, fell away entirely
as all students turned to look at her.</p>
<p>"By now you have all heard," she said, her voice not quite
steady. <em>That Hermione Granger is dead.</em> She didn't say
those words aloud, since they had all heard. "Somehow, a troll was
infiltrated into the castle Hogwarts without alarm from our ancient
wards. Somehow this troll succeeded in injuring a student, without
alarm from the wards until the point of her death. Investigations
are underway to determine how this has occurred. The Board of
Governors is meeting to determine how Hogwarts will respond. In due
time justice shall be served. Meanwhile there is another matter of
justice, which must be handled at once. George Weasley, Fred
Weasley, please come forward to stand before us all."</p>
<p>The Weasley twins exchanged glances where they sat at the
Gryffindor table, and then stood up and walked toward her, slowly,
reluctantly; and Minerva realized then that the Weasley twins
thought that they were to be expelled.</p>
<p>They honestly thought that she would expel them.</p>
<p>That was what the picture of Professor McGonagall who lived in
her head had wrought.</p>
<p>The Weasley twins walked over to the lectern, looking up at her
with faces that were frightened, but resolute; and she felt
something in her heart break a little further.</p>
<p>"I am not going to expel you," she said, and was saddened
further by the surprised look on their faces. "Fred Weasley, George
Weasley, turn and face your classmates, let them see you."</p>
<p>Still looking surprised, the Weasley twins did so.</p>
<p>She drew up all the steel in her heart, and said what was
right.</p>
<p>"I am ashamed," said Minerva McGonagall, "of the events of this
day. I am ashamed that there were only two of you. Ashamed of what
I have done to Gryffindor. Of all the Houses, it should have been
Gryffindor to help when Hermione Granger was in need, when Harry
Potter called for the brave to aid him. It was true, a seventh-year
could have held back a mountain troll while searching for Miss
Granger. And you should have believed that the Head of House
Gryffindor," her voice broke, "would have believed in you. If you
disobeyed her to do what was right, in events she had not foreseen.
And the reason you did not believe this, is that I have never shown
it to you. I did not believe in you. I did not believe in the
virtues of Gryffindor itself. I tried to stamp out your defiance,
instead of training your courage to wisdom. Whatever the Sorting
Hat saw in me that led it to place me in Gryffindor, I have
betrayed it. I have offered my resignation to the Headmaster as
Deputy Headmistress and as the Head of House Gryffindor."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>There were cries of shock and dismay, and not only from the
Gryffindor Table, as Harry's heart froze within his chest. Harry
needed to run forward, say something, he hadn't meant for
<em>this</em> to -</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Minerva took another breath, and continued. "However, the
Headmaster has declined to accept my resignation," she said. "So I
will continue to serve, and try to undo what I have wrought.
Somehow I must find a way to teach my students how to do what is
right. Not what is safe, not what is easy, not what we are told to
do. If all I can teach you is to turn in your essays on time, there
might as well not be a House Gryffindor. This road will be more
difficult for me, and maybe for all of us. But I know now that
before I was only taking the easy path."</p>
<p>She stepped down from the lectern, moved down to where the
Weasley twins stood.</p>
<p>"Fred Weasley, George Weasley," she said. "The two of you have
not always done what is right. The path of wisdom does not lie in
flagrant and needless defiance of authority. And yet today you
proved to be the last of our House to survive my mistakes. Because
it was the right thing to do, you defied a threat of expulsion and
risked your lives to face a mountain troll. For your astounding
courage that honors your House to have you, I award each of you two
hundred points for Gryffindor."</p>
<p>Again the look of shock on their faces, again the pain like a
knife through her heart.</p>
<p>She turned to face the other students.</p>
<p>"I will not award any points to Ravenclaw," she said. "I suspect
that Mr. Potter would not want them. If I am wrong, he may correct
me and take as many House points as he pleases. But for whatever it
is worth, Mr. Potter, I am," her voice faltered, "I am sorry -"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"<em>Stop!</em> " Harry screamed, and then, again, "Stop." The
word sticking in his throat. "You don't have to, Professor."
Something inside him was twisting, threatening to split him open,
like a giant's hands wrenching at him to tear him in half. "And,
and you shouldn't forget Susan Bones, and Ron Weasley - they also
helped, they should get House points too -"</p>
<p>"Miss Bones and the young Weasley?" said Professor McGonagall.
"Rubeus said nothing of that - what did they do?"</p>
<p><em>"</em>Miss Bones tried to stun Mr. Hagrid when he tried to
stop me, and Mr. Weasley shot Neville when Neville tried to stop
me. They should both get points, and, and so should Neville," Harry
hadn't thought to imagine it before, the way Neville must be
feeling now, but the instant he'd thought, he knew, "because
Neville tried to do something, even if it wasn't the right thing,
doing what's right is the <em>second</em> lesson, you can start
practicing that after you learn to do anything at all -"</p>
<p>"Ten points to Hufflepuff, Miss Bones," Professor McGonagall
said, her voice breaking in the middle. "Ten points to Gryffindor,
Ron Weasley, your family has done itself exceeding proud, this day.
And ten points to Hufflepuff for Neville Longbottom, for standing
up to Mr. Potter and doing what he thought was right -"</p>
<p><em>"You shouldn't!</em> " screamed a young voice from the
Hufflepuff table, followed by a single choking sound.</p>
<p>Harry looked there, and then quickly looked back at Professor
McGonagall and said, as steadily as he could, "Neville's right,
actually, you can't award literally zero points for the part where
you get the action correct, that sends the wrong message too, but
he was halfway there so it could be five points instead."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall looked, for a moment, like she couldn't
think of what to say; but then her eyes went to Neville's place at
the table, and she said, "As you wish, Mr. Potter. What is it, Miss
Bones?"</p>
<p>Harry looked and saw that Susan Bones had stepped forward,
wiping at her own eyes, and the Hufflepuff girl said, "Actually -
Professor McGonagall - General Potter didn't see it - but Captain
Weasley and I weren't the only ones who tried to get in Mr.
Hagrid's way, after he ran out. Before some of the older students
stopped us. But we managed to slow Mr. Hagrid down a minute, so
General Potter could get away."</p>
<p>"You've got to give them points too," said Ron Weasley from the
Gryffindor table. "Or I won't take any."</p>
<p>"Who else?" said Professor McGonagall, her voice a bit
unsteady.</p>
<p>Seven other children stood up.</p>
<p><em>What was that our Slytherin side was saying about predicting
nothing would ever work?</em> said Hufflepuff.</p>
<p>Something in Harry cracked, so that he had to exert all his
force to hold himself together.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>When all had been said, and all had been done, Minerva went to
where Harry Potter stood. Though it was not her greatest skill she
cast a ward about them to blur vision, and muffled sounds with
another thought.</p>
<p>"You, you didn't have to -" said Harry Potter. "You shouldn't
have said -" He sounded like he was choking. "P-Professor,
everything I said to you was hurtful, and hateful, and wrong -"</p>
<p>"I already knew that, Harry," she said. "Even so, I wished to do
better." There was a feeling of lightness in her chest, much as one
might experience after stepping off a cliff, when your legs no
longer had to hold your body upright. She wasn't sure she could do
this, she did not know the way; and yet for the first time it
seemed possible that Hogwarts wouldn't become a sad ghost of its
former self, when she became its Headmistress.</p>
<p>Harry stared at her, then made a odd noise that sounded like it
had been forced from his throat, and covered his face in his
hands.</p>
<p>So she knelt down, and hugged him. It might go wrong, but it
might also go right, and she would not let that uncertainty stop
her; it was time she began to learn a Gryffindor's courage, so that
she could teach it in turn.</p>
<p>"I had a sister once," she whispered. Just that, and nothing
more.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Just to make sure,</em> said some part of Harry, while the
rest of him sobbed into Professor McGonagall's arms, <em>this
doesn't mean we've accepted Hermione's death, right?</em></p>
<p><em>NO</em> said all the rest of him, every part of his mind in
unanimous agreement, warmth and cold and a hidden place of steel.
<em>Never, ever, forever.</em></p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>And an ancient wizard to whom that ward meant nothing gazed upon
them both, the witch and the weeping young wizard. Albus Dumbledore
was smiling with a strange sad look in his eyes, like someone who
has taken one more step toward a foreseen destination.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The Defense Professor watched them both, the woman and the
crying boy. His eyes were very cold, and very calculating.</p>
<p>He did not think that this would be enough.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>It wasn't until the next morning that it was discovered that
Hermione Granger's body was missing.</p>
</div>
<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 94: Roles, Pt 5<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p><em>The first meeting:</em></p>
<p>At 6:07am on April 17th, 1992 the Sun was just rising above the
horizon as seen from the castle Hogwarts, filtering in through
drawn curtains in the Ravenclaw first-year boys' dorm to provide a
gentle light, red-orange for dawn and little-changed by the white
fabric covering the windows, not yet waking boys more accustomed to
winter's schedule.</p>
<p>In one bed among many, Harry Potter slept the sleep of the just
exhausted.</p>
<p>Quietly the door opened.</p>
<p>Quietly a figure walked across the floor.</p>
<p>That figure came to Harry Potter's bed.</p>
<p>The figure laid a hand on the shoulder of the sleeping boy, who
started and shrieked.</p>
<p>No others heard.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter," the small man squeaked, "the Headmaster has
requested your presence immediately."</p>
<p>Slowly the boy sat up in bed, his hands momentarily fiddling
beneath the covers. He'd expected to feel much worse, waking up
this morning. It felt... wrong, that his brain functioned now, that
his thoughts still moved, that he wasn't incapacitated with weeping
for at least a week. The boy knew that it wouldn't have been an
adaptive response, for brains to evolve to do that. His dark side,
certainly, would not do that. Even so, it still felt wrong to be
alive and lucid, this morning.</p>
<p>But his resolution to revive Hermione Granger felt - sufficient,
like he was already doing the right thing, bent on the right path,
and she would be brought back, and that was all there was to it;
grief would have been giving up. There was nothing left to decide,
no ambiguity, no conflict to tear at him, and no need to remember
what he'd <em>seen</em> -</p>
<p>"I'll get dressed," Harry said.</p>
<p>Professor Flitwick looked rather reluctant, but said in his high
voice, "The Headmaster specified you were to be brought to his
office directly and without pause, Mr. Potter. I'm sorry."</p>
<p>Less than a minute later - Professor Flitwick had sent him
straight to the Headmaster's office through the Hogwarts internal
Floo - Harry found himself, still in his pajamas, facing Albus
Dumbledore. The Deputy Headmistress was also sitting in another
chair, and the Potions Master lurked nearby amid the weird devices,
caught in a gaping yawn just as Harry had entered through the
fireplace.</p>
<p>"Harry," the Headmaster said without preamble, "before I say
what I must say next, I tell you that Hermione Granger did truly
die. The wards recorded it and informed me. The very stones spoke
that a witch had died. I tested her body where it lay and those
were Hermione Granger's true mortal remains, not any doll or
likeness. There is no way known to wizardry by which death may be
undone. All this being said, Hermione Granger's remains are now
missing from the storeroom where they were placed, and where you
guarded them. Did you take them, Harry Potter?"</p>
<p>"No," Harry said, narrowing his eyes. A glance showed him that
Severus was watching him intently.</p>
<p>Dumbledore's gaze was also keen, though not unfriendly. "Is
Hermione Granger's body in your possession?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Do you know where it is?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Do you know who took it?"</p>
<p>"No," Harry said, then hesitated. "Besides the obvious
probabilistic speculations which are not based upon any specific
knowledge of mine."</p>
<p>The old wizard nodded. "Do you know why it was taken?"</p>
<p>"No. Besides the obvious speculations etcetera."</p>
<p>"What would those be?" Sharp the ancient eyes.</p>
<p>"If the enemy can notice you running off to consult the Weasley
twins during class after Hermione was arrested, and find out about
that magic map you said was stolen, then the enemy can wonder why I
was guarding Hermione Granger's body. My turn. Did you arrange for
Hermione's death in hopes of getting the money back from
Lucius?"</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " said Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>"No," said the old wizard.</p>
<p>"Did you know or suspect that Hermione Granger would die?"</p>
<p>"I did not know. As for suspicions, I placed her in the most
strongly defended position I could, against Voldemort. I did not
will her death, nor allow it, nor plan to benefit from it, Harry
Potter. Now show me your pouch."</p>
<p>"It's in my trunk -" Harry began.</p>
<p>"Severus," said the old wizard, and the Potions Master moved
forward. "Check his trunk as well, every compartment."</p>
<p>"My trunk has wards."</p>
<p>Severus Snape grinned mirthlessly and strode into the green
flame.</p>
<p>Dumbledore took out his long dark-grey wand and began to wave it
close around Harry's hair, looking like a Muggle using a
metal-detector. Before he had reached as far as Harry's neck,
Dumbledore stopped.</p>
<p>"The gem upon your ring," Dumbledore said. "It is no longer a
clear diamond. It is brown, the color of Hermione Granger's eyes,
and the color of her hair."</p>
<p>A sudden tension filled the room.</p>
<p>"That's my father's rock," Harry said. "Transfigured the same as
before. I just did it to remember Hermione -"</p>
<p>"I must be sure. Take off that ring, Harry, and place it upon my
desk."</p>
<p>Slowly, Harry did so, removing the gem and setting the ring off
to the other side of the desk.</p>
<p>Dumbledore pointed his wand at the gem and -</p>
<p>A large, undistinguished grey rock jumped into the air from the
force of its sudden expansion, hit some invisible barrier in the
air above, and then fell with a loud crack upon the Headmaster's
desk,</p>
<p>"There's another half-hour of work for me, Transfiguring it
again," Harry said evenly.</p>
<p>Dumbledore resumed his examination. Harry had to remove his left
shoe, and take off the toe-ring that was his emergency portkey if
someone kidnapped him and took him outside the wards of Hogwarts
(and didn't put up anti-Apparition, anti-portkey, anti-phoenix, and
anti-time-looping wards, which Severus had warned Harry that any
inner-circle Death Eater would certainly do). It was verified that
the magic radiating from the toe-ring was indeed the magic of a
portkey, and not the magic of a Transfiguration. The rest of Harry
was deemed clear.</p>
<p>Not long after, the Potions Master returned, bearing Harry's
pouch, and several other magical things which had been in Harry's
trunk, which the Headmaster also examined, one by one, even to all
the items remaining within the healer's kit.</p>
<p>"Can I go now?" Harry said when it was all done, putting as much
cold as he could into his voice. He took up his pouch, and began
the process of feeding the grey rock into it. The empty ring went
back on his finger.</p>
<p>The old wizard breathed out, slipping his wand back into his
sleeve. "I <em>am</em> sorry," he said. "I had to know. Harry...
the Dark Lord has taken Hermione Granger's remains, it seems. I
cannot think of anything he would gain thereby, except to send her
corpse against you as an Inferius. Severus shall give you certain
potions to keep about your person. Be warned now, and be prepared
for when you must do what must be done."</p>
<p>"Will the Inferius have Hermione's mind?"</p>
<p>"No -"</p>
<p>"Then it's not her. Can I go? At least to change out of my
pyjamas."</p>
<p>"There is other news, but I shall be brief. The wards of
Hogwarts record that no foreign creature has entered, and that it
was the Defense Professor who killed Hermione Granger."</p>
<p>"Um," Harry said.</p>
<p><em>Thought 1: But I saw the troll kill Hermione.</em></p>
<p><em>Thought 2: Professor Quirrell Memory-Charmed me and set up
the scene that Dumbledore saw when he arrived.</em></p>
<p><em>Thought 3: Professor Quirrell can't do that, his magic can't
touch mine. I saw that in Azkaban -</em></p>
<p><em>Thought 4: Can I trust those memories?</em></p>
<p><em>Thought 5: There was clearly some sort of debacle at
Azkaban, we wouldn't have needed a rocket if Professor Quirrell
hadn't fallen unconscious, and why'd he be unconscious if not
-</em></p>
<p><em>Thought 6: Did I ever actually go to Azkaban at
all?</em></p>
<p><em>Thought 7: I clearly practiced controlling Dementors at some
point before I scared that Dementor in the Wizengamot. And</em>
that <em>was in the newspapers.</em></p>
<p><em>Thought 8: Am I accurately remembering the
newspapers?</em></p>
<p>"Um," Harry said again. "That spell seriously ought to be
Unforgiveable. You think Professor Quirrell could have
Memory-Charmed -"</p>
<p>"No. I went back through time and placed certain instruments to
record Hermione's last battle, which I could not quite bear to
watch in my own person." The old wizard looked very grim indeed.
"Your guess was right, Harry Potter. Voldemort sabotaged everything
we gave Hermione to protect her. Her broomstick lay dead in her
hands. Her invisibility cloak did not conceal her. The troll walked
in the sunlight unharmed; it was no stray creature, but a weapon
pure and aimed. And it was indeed the troll who killed her, with
strength alone, so that my wards and webs to detect hostile magics
went for naught. The Defense Professor never crossed her path."</p>
<p>Harry swallowed, shut his eyes, and thought. "So this was an
attempted frame on Professor Quirrell. Somehow. It does seem to be
the enemy's <em>modus operandi.</em> Troll eats Hermione Granger,
check the wards, oh look actually the Defense Professor did it,
same as last year... no. No, that can't be right."</p>
<p>"Why not, Mr. Potter?" said the Potions Master. "It seems
obvious enough to me -"</p>
<p>"That's the problem."</p>
<p><em>The enemy is smart.</em></p>
<p>Slowly the fog of sleep was drifting out of Harry's mind, and
after a full night's sleep his brain could see the things which
hadn't been obvious the day before.</p>
<p>Under standard literary convention... the enemy wasn't supposed
to look over what you'd done, sabotage the magic items you'd handed
out, and then send out a troll rendered undetectable by some means
the heroes couldn't figure out even after the fact, so that you
might as well have not defended yourself at all. In a book, the
point-of-view usually stayed on the main characters. Having the
enemy just bypass all the protagonists' work, as a result of
planning and actions taken out of literary sight, would be a
<em>diabolus ex machina,</em> and dramatically unsatisfying.</p>
<p>But in real life the enemy would think that they were the main
character, and they would also be clever, and think things through
in advance, even if you didn't see them do it. That was why
everything about this felt so disjointed, with parts unexplained
and seemingly inexplicable. How had Lucius felt, when Harry had
threatened Dumbledore with breaking Azkaban? How had the Aurors
above Azkaban felt, seeing the broomstick rise up on a torch of
fire?</p>
<p><em>The enemy is smart.</em></p>
<p>"The enemy knew perfectly well that you'd turn back time to
check what really happened to Hermione, especially since the troll
getting into Hogwarts at all tells us that somebody can fool the
wards." Harry shut his eyes, thinking harder, trying to put himself
into the enemy's shoes. Why would he, or his dark side, have done
something like - "We're meant to conclude that the enemy has
control of what the wards tell us. But that's actually something
the enemy can only do with difficulty, or under special conditions;
they're trying to create a false appearance of omnipotence."
<em>Like I would.</em> "Later, hypothetically, the wards show
Professor Sinistra killing someone. We think the wards are just
being fooled again, but really, Professor Sinistra was Legilimized
and she <em>did</em> do it."</p>
<p>"Unless that is precisely what the Dark Lord expects us to
think," said Severus Snape, his brow furrowed in concentration. "In
which case he does have control of the wards, and Professor
Sinistra will be innocent."</p>
<p>"Does the Dark Lord <em>really</em> use plots with that many
levels of meta -"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Dumbledore and Severus.</p>
<p>Harry nodded distantly. "Then this could be a setup to either
make us think the wards are telling the truth when they're lying,
or a setup to make us think the wards are lying when they're
telling the truth, depending on what level the enemy expects us to
reason at. But if the enemy is planning to make us trust the wards
- we would have trusted the wards anyway, if we'd been given no
reason to distrust them. So there's no need to go to all the work
of framing Professor Quirrell in a way that we would realize we
were intended to discover, just to trick us into going meta -"</p>
<p>"Not so," said Dumbledore. "If Voldemort has not fully mastered
the wards, then the wards had to believe that some Professor's hand
was at work. Else they would have cried out at Miss Granger's
injury, and not only upon her death."</p>
<p>Harry reached up a hand and rubbed at his brow, just beneath his
hair.</p>
<p><em>Okay, serious question. If the enemy is that smart, why the
heck am I still alive? Is it seriously that hard to poison someone,
are there Charms and Potions and bezoars which can cure me of
literally anything that could be slipped into my breakfast?</em>
<em>Would the wards record it, trace the magic of the
murderer?</em></p>
<p><em>Could my</em> scar <em>contain the fragment of soul that's
keeping the Dark Lord anchored to the world, so he doesn't want to
kill me? Instead he's trying to drive off all my friends to weaken
my spirit so he can take over my body? It'd explain the Parselmouth
thing. The Sorting Hat might not be able to detect a
lich-phylactery-thingy. Obvious problem 1, the Dark Lord is
supposed to have made his lich-phylactery-thingy in 1943 by killing
whatshername and framing Mr. Hagrid. Obvious problem 2, there's no
such thing as souls.</em></p>
<p><em>Though Dumbledore also thought that my blood was a key
ingredient in a ritual to restore the Dark Lord's full strength,
which would require keeping me alive until then... now there's a
cheery thought.</em></p>
<p>"Well..." Harry said. "I'm sure of one thing."</p>
<p>"And that is?"</p>
<p>"Neville needs to be taken out of Hogwarts <em>now.</em> He's
the obvious next target and no first-year student can survive this
level of offense. We're lucky Neville wasn't assassinated yesterday
evening, the enemy doesn't have to wait until we're finished
mourning to make their next move." <em>Why didn't the enemy strike
while we were distracted?</em></p>
<p>Dumbledore exchanged glances with Severus, and then with the
suddenly tight expression of Professor McGonagall. "Harry," said
the old wizard, "if you send all your friends away yourself, that
is just the same as if Voldemort -"</p>
<p>"I will be <em>fine</em> I can do without Neville for a couple
of extra months it's not like you were planning to make my friends
stay here over the summer and that is just plain <em>not sufficient
justification</em> to let him get killed! Professor McGonagall
-"</p>
<p>"I quite agree," said the Scottish witch. She frowned. "I
extremely agree. I agree to the point where... I'm having some
trouble figuring out how to express this, Albus..."</p>
<p>"To the point where you're going to haul him out of there
yourself, regardless of what anyone else says, because it's no
excuse to say you were only following orders if Neville gets
killed?" Harry said.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall closed her eyes briefly. "Yes, but surely
there ought to be some way to be responsible without threats of
unilateral action."</p>
<p>The Headmaster sighed. "No need. Go, Minerva."</p>
<p>"Wait," the Potions Master said, just as Professor McGonagall,
moving rather swiftly, was taking a pinch of green dust from the
Floo-vase. "We should not call attention to the boy, as the
Headmaster called attention to the Weasley twins. It would be
wiser, I think, if Mr. Longbottom's grandmother took him from
Hogwarts. Let him stay in his Common Room for now; the Dark Lord
does not seem able to act so openly."</p>
<p>There was another long exchange of glances among the four, and
finally Harry nodded, followed by Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>"In that case," said Harry, "I'm sure of one other thing."</p>
<p>"And that is?" said Dumbledore.</p>
<p>"I very much need to visit the washroom, and I would also like
to change out of these pyjamas."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"By the way," Harry said as he and the Headmaster emerged from
Floo into the empty office of the Ravenclaw Head of House. "One
last quick question I wanted to ask just you. That sword the
Weasley twins pulled out of the Sorting Hat. That was the Sword of
Gryffindor, wasn't it?"</p>
<p>The old wizard turned, face neutral. "What makes you think that,
Harry?"</p>
<p>"The Sorting Hat yelled <em>Gryffindor!</em> just before handing
it out, the sword had a ruby pommel and gold letters on the blade,
and the Latin script said <em>Nothing better</em>. Just a
hunch."</p>
<p>"<em>Nihil supernum,</em>" said the old wizard. "That is not
<em>quite</em> what it means."</p>
<p>Harry nodded. "Mmhm. What'd you do with it?"</p>
<p>"I retrieved it from where it fell, and placed it in a secure
place," the old wizard said. He gave Harry a stern look. "I hope
you are not greedy for it yourself, young Ravenclaw."</p>
<p>"Not at all, just want to make sure you're not keeping it
permanently from its rightful wielders. So the Weasley twins are
the Heir of Gryffindor, then?"</p>
<p>"The Heir of Gryffindor?" Dumbledore said, looking surprised.
Then the old wizard smiled, blue eyes twinkling brightly. "Ah,
Harry, Salazar Slytherin may have built a Chamber of Secrets into
Hogwarts, but Godric Gryffindor was not much given to such
extravagances. We have seen only that Godric left his Sword to the
defense of Hogwarts, if a worthy student ever faced a foe they
could not defeat alone."</p>
<p>"That's not the same as saying no. Don't think I didn't notice
that you didn't actually say no."</p>
<p>"I did not live in those years, Harry, and I do not know all
that Godric Gryffindor may or may not have done -"</p>
<p>"Do you in fact assign greater than fifty percent subjective
probability that there is something like a Heir of Gryffindor and
one or both Weasley twins are it. Yes or no, evasion means yes.
You're not going to succeed in distracting me, no matter how much I
have to go to the bathroom."</p>
<p>The old wizard sighed. "Yes, Fred and George Weasley are the
Heir of Gryffindor. I beg you not to speak of it to them, not
yet."</p>
<p>Harry nodded, and turned to go. "I'm surprised," Harry said. "I
read a little about Godric Gryffindor's historical life. The
Weasley twins are... well, they're awesome in various ways, but
they don't seem much like the Godric in the history books."</p>
<p>"Only a man exceedingly proud and vain," Dumbledore said
quietly, as he turned back to the Floo roaring up again with green
flames, "would believe that his heir should be like himself, rather
than like who he wished that he could be."</p>
<p>The Headmaster stepped into green fire, and was gone.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>The second meeting (in a small cubby off the Hufflepuff
Common Room):</em></p>
<p>Neville Longbottom's face was drawn up in anguish, as he spoke
with no one to hear, to the empty air.</p>
<p>"Seriously," the empty air said back to him. "I'm wearing an
invisibility cloak with extra anti-detection charms just to walk
through the hallways because <em>I</em> don't want to be killed. My
parents would have me out of Hogwarts in an instant if the
Headmaster allowed it. Neville, your getting the heck out of
Hogwarts is common sense, it has <em>nothing to do</em> with -"</p>
<p>"I betrayed you, General," Neville said, his voice around as
hollow as any normal eleven-year-old boy could reasonably manage.
"I didn't even do it the Chaotic way. I conformed to authority and
tried to make you conform to authority too. What's that you always
say, about how in the Chaos Legion, a soldier who can only obey
orders is useless?"</p>
<p>"Neville," the empty air said firmly. The pressure of two hands,
beneath thin cloth, came firmly to bear on Neville's shoulders; and
the voice moved closer to him. "You weren't blindly obeying
authority, you were trying to protect me. It's true that in this
chaotic world, soldiers who can only follow rules and regulations
are worthless. However, soldiers who follow rules for the sake of
protecting their friends are -"</p>
<p>"Slightly better than worthless?" Neville said bitterly.</p>
<p>"<em>Significantly</em> better than worthless. Neville, you made
an error of judgment. It cost me around six seconds. Now it could
be that Hermione's injuries were just barely fatal, but even then,
I don't think six seconds was actually enough time for the troll to
take an extra bite of Hermione. In the counterfactual world where
you didn't step in front of me, Hermione still died. Now, I could
stand here listing out the first dozen ways that Hermione would be
alive if I hadn't been stupid -"</p>
<p>"You? <em>You</em> ran right out after her. <em>I'm</em> the one
who tried to stop you. It's my fault if it's anyone's," Neville
said bitterly.</p>
<p>The empty air went silent at this for a while.</p>
<p>"Wow," the empty air finally said. "Wow. That puts a pretty
different perspective on things, I have to say. I'm going to
remember this the next time I feel an impulse to blame myself for
something. Neville, the term in the literature for this is
'egocentric bias', it means that you experience everything about
your own life but you don't get to experience everything else that
happens in the world. There was way, way more going on than you
running in front of me. You're going to spend weeks remembering
that thing you did there for six seconds, I can tell, but nobody
else is going to bother thinking about it. Other people spend a lot
less time thinking about your past mistakes than you do, just
because you're not the center of their worlds. I <em>guarantee</em>
to you that nobody except you has even <em>considered</em> blaming
Neville Longbottom for what happened to Hermione. Not for a
fraction of a second. You are being, if you will pardon the phrase,
a silly-dilly. Now shut up and say goodbye."</p>
<p>"I don't want to say goodbye," Neville said. His voice was
trembling, but he managed not to cry. "I want to stay here and
fight with you against - against whatever's happening."</p>
<p>The empty air moved closer to him, and embraced him in a hug,
and Harry Potter's voice whispered, "Tough luck."</p>

<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 95: Roles, Pt 6<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p><em>The third meeting<br>
(10:31am, April 17th 1992)</em></p>
<p>Spring had begun, the late-morning air still crisp with the
leavings of winter. Daffodils had bloomed amid the sprouting grass
of the forest, the gentle yellow petals with their golden hearts
dangling limply from their dead, grayed stems, wounded or killed by
one of the sudden frosts that you often saw in April. In the
Forbidden Forest there would be stranger lifeforms, centaurs and
unicorns at the least, and Harry had heard allegations of
werewolves. Though from what Harry had read of real-life
werewolves, that did not make the slightest bit of sense.</p>
<p>Harry didn't venture anywhere near the border of the Forbidden
Forest, since there was no reason to take the risk. He walked
invisibly among the more ordinary life-forms of the permitted
woods, wand in hand, a broomstick strapped to his back for easier
access, just in case. He was not actually afraid; Harry thought it
odd that he didn't feel afraid. The state of constant vigilance,
readiness for fight or flight, failed to feel burdensome or even
abnormal.</p>
<p>On the edges of the permitted woods Harry walked, his feet never
straying near the beaten path where he might be more easily found,
never leaving sight of Hogwarts's windows. Harry had set the alarm
upon his mechanical watch to tell him when it was lunchtime, since
he couldn't actually look at his wrist, being invisible and all
that. It raised the question of how his eyeglasses worked while he
was wearing the Cloak. For that matter the Law of the Excluded
Middle seemed to imply that either the rhodopsin complexes in his
retina were absorbing photons and transducing them to neural
spikes, or alternatively, those photons were going straight through
his body and out the other side, but not both. It really did seem
increasingly likely that invisibility cloaks let you see outward
while being invisible yourself because, on some fundamental level,
that was how the caster had - not <em>wanted</em> - but
<em>implicitly believed</em> - that invisibility should work.</p>
<p>Whereupon you had to wonder whether anyone had tried Confunding
or Legilimizing someone into implicitly and matter-of-factly
believing that <em>Fixus Everythingus</em> ought to be an easy
first-year Charm, and then trying to invent it.</p>
<p>Or maybe find a worthy Muggleborn in a country that didn't
identify Muggleborn children, and tell them some extensive lies,
fake up a surrounding story and corresponding evidence, so that,
from the very beginning, they'd have a different idea of what magic
could do. Though apparently they'd still have to learn a number of
previous Charms before they became capable of inventing their
own...</p>
<p>It might not work. Surely there'd been some organically insane
wizards who'd truly believed in their own possibility of godhood,
and yet had failed to become god. But even the insane had probably
believed the ascension spell ought to be some grandiose dramatic
ritual and not something you did with a carefully composed twitch
of your wand and the incantation <em>Becomus Goddus.</em></p>
<p>Harry was already pretty sure it wouldn't be that easy. But then
the question was, <em>why not?</em> What pattern had his brain
learned? Could the reason be predicted in advance?</p>
<p>A slight fringe of apprehension crept through Harry then, a
tinge of worry, as he contemplated this question. The nameless
concern sharpened, grew greater -</p>
<p><em>Professor Quirrell?</em></p>
<p>"Mr. Potter," a soft voice called from behind him.</p>
<p>Harry spun, his hand going to the Time-Turner beneath his cloak;
again the principle of being ready to flee upon an instant's notice
felt only ordinary.</p>
<p>Slowly, palms empty and turned outward, Professor Quirrell was
walking towards him within the forests' outskirts, coming from the
general direction of the Hogwarts castle.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter," Professor Quirrell said again. "I know that you're
here. You know that I know that you're here. I must speak to
you."</p>
<p>Still Harry said nothing. Professor Quirrell hadn't actually
said what this was about, and Harry's sunlit morning walk about the
forest edge had produced a mood of silence within him.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell took a small step to the left, a step
forward, another to the right. He tilted his head with a look of
calculation, and then he walked almost directly towards where Harry
stood, halted a few paces off with the sense of doom enflamed to
the height of bearability.</p>
<p>"Are you still resolved upon your course?" Professor Quirrell
said. "The same course you spoke of yesterday?"</p>
<p>Again Harry did not reply.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell sighed. "There is much I have done for you,"
the man said. "Whatever else you may wonder of me, you cannot deny
that. I am calling in some of the debt. Talk to me, Mr.
Potter."</p>
<p><em>I don't feel like doing this right now,</em> Harry thought;
then: <em>Oh, right.</em></p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Two hours later, after Harry had spun the Time-Turner once,
noted down the exact time and memorized his exact location, spent
another hour walking, went inside and told Professor McGonagall
that he was currently talking to the Defense Professor in the woods
outside Hogwarts (just in case anything happened to him), walked
for a further hour, then returned to his original location exactly
one hour after he'd left and spun the Time-Turner again -</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"What was that?" Professor Quirrell said, blinking. "Did you
just -"</p>
<p>"Nothing important," Harry said without pulling back the hood of
his invisibility cloak, or taking his hand from his Time-Turner.
"Yes, I'm still resolved. To be honest, I'm thinking I shouldn't
have said anything."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell inclined his head. "A sentiment which shall
serve you well in life. Is there anything which is liable to change
your mind?"</p>
<p>"Professor, if I already <em>knew</em> about the existence of an
argument which would change my decision -"</p>
<p>"True, for the likes of us. But you would be surprised how often
someone knows what they are waiting to hear, yet must wait to hear
it said." Professor Quirrell shook his head. "To put this in your
terms... there is a true fact, known to me but not to you, of which
I would like to convince you, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>Harry's eyebrows rose, though he realized in the next moment
that Professor Quirrell couldn't see it. "That's in my terms, all
right. Go ahead."</p>
<p>"The intention you have formed is far more dangerous than you
realize."</p>
<p>Replying to this surprising statement did not take much thought
on Harry's part. "Define dangerous, and tell me what you think you
know and how you think you know it."</p>
<p>"Sometimes," said Professor Quirrell, "telling someone about a
danger can cause them to walk directly into it. I have no intention
of having that happen this time. Do you expect me to tell you
exactly what you must not do? Exactly why I am afraid?" The man
shook his head. "If you were wizardborn, Mr. Potter, you would know
to take it seriously, when a powerful magus tells you only to
beware."</p>
<p>It would have been a lie to say that Harry was not annoyed, but
he also wasn't an idiot; so Harry said merely, "Is there anything
you <em>can</em> tell me?"</p>
<p>Carefully, Professor Quirrell seated himself upon the grass, and
took out his wand, his hand assuming a position that Harry
recognized. Harry's breath caught.</p>
<p>"This is the last time that I shall be able to do this for you,"
Professor Quirrell said quietly. Then the man began to speak words
that were strange, of no language Harry could recognize, intonation
that seemed not quite human, words which seemed to slip from
Harry's memory even as he tried to grasp them, exiting from his
mind as quickly as they entered.</p>
<p>The spell took effect more slowly, this time. The trees seemed
to darken, branches and leaves staining, as though seen through
perfect sunglasses that faded and attenuated light without
distorting it. The blue bowl of the sky receded, the horizon which
Harry's brain falsely assigned a finite distance pulling back as it
turned gray, and darker gray. The clouds became translucent,
transparent, wisping away to let the darkness shine through.</p>
<p>The forest shaded, faded, abated into blackness.</p>
<p>The great sky river became visible once again, as Harry's eyes
adjusted, became able to see the largest object which human eyes
could ever behold as more than a point, the surrounding Milky
Way.</p>
<p>And the stars, piercingly bright and yet remote, out of a great
depth.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell breathed deeply. Then he raised his wand
again (just barely visible, in the starlight without sun or moon)
and tapped himself on the head with a sound like an egg
cracking.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor also faded away, became likewise
invisible.</p>
<p>A tiny disk of grass, illuminated by not much light at all,
drifted unoccupied within empty space.</p>
<p>Neither of them spoke for a time. Harry was content to look at
the stars, undistracted even by his own body. Whatever Professor
Quirrell had called him here to say, it would be said in due
time.</p>
<p>In due time, a voice spoke.</p>
<p>"There is no war here," said a soft voice emanating from within
the emptiness. "No conflict and battle, no politics and betrayal,
no death and no life. That is all for the folly of men. The stars
are above such foolishness, untouched by it. Here there is peace,
and silence eternal. So I once thought."</p>
<p>Harry turned to look at where the voice originated, and saw only
stars.</p>
<p>"So you once thought?" Harry said, when no other words seemed to
be forthcoming.</p>
<p>"There is nothing above the folly of men," whispered the voice
from the emptiness. "There is nothing beyond the destructive powers
of sufficiently intelligent idiocy, not even the stars themselves.
I went to a great deal of trouble to make a certain golden plaque
last forever. I would not like to see it destroyed by human
folly."</p>
<p>Again Harry's eyes reflexively darted toward where the voice
should have been, again saw only emptiness. "I think I can reassure
you on that score, Professor. Nuclear weapons don't have a fireball
extending out for... how far away is Pioneer 11? Somewhere around a
billion kilometers, maybe? Muggles talk about nuclear weapons
destroying the world, but what they actually mean is lightly
warming up some of Earth's surface. The <em>Sun</em> is a giant
fusion reaction and <em>it</em> doesn't vaporize distant space
probes. The worst-case scenario for nuclear war wouldn't even come
close to destroying the Solar System, not that this is much of a
consolation."</p>
<p>"True while we speak of Muggles," said the soft voice amid
starlight. "But what do Muggles know of true power? It is not they
who frighten me now. It is you."</p>
<p>"Professor," Harry said carefully, "while I have to admit I've
rolled a few critical failures in my life, there's a bit of
distance between that and missing a saving throw so hard that the
Pioneer 11 probe gets caught in the blast radius. There's no
realistic way to do that without blowing up the Sun. And before you
ask, our Sun is a main-sequence G-type star, it <em>can't</em>
explode. Any energy input would just increase the volume of the
hydrogen plasma, the Sun doesn't have a degenerate core that could
be detonated. The Sun doesn't have enough mass to go supernova,
even at the end of its lifespan."</p>
<p>"Such amazing things the Muggles have learned," the other voice
murmured. "How stars live, how they are preserved from death, how
they die. And they never wonder if such knowledge might be
dangerous."</p>
<p>"In all frankness, Professor, that particular thought has never
occurred to me either."</p>
<p>"You are Muggleborn. I speak not of blood, I speak of how you
spent your childhood years. There is a freedom of thought in that,
true. But there is also wisdom in the caution of wizardkind. It has
been three hundred and twenty-three years since the magical
territories of Sicily were ruined by one man's folly. Such
incidents were more common in the years when Hogwarts was raised.
Commoner still, in the aftertime of Merlin. Of the time before
Merlin, little remains to study."</p>
<p>"There's around thirty orders of magnitude of difference between
that and blowing up the Sun," Harry observed, then caught himself.
"But that's a pointless quibble, sorry, blowing up a country would
also be bad, I agree. In any case, Professor, I don't plan on doing
anything like that."</p>
<p>"Your choice is not required, Mr. Potter. If you had read more
wizardborn novels and fewer Muggle stories, you would know. In
serious literature the wizard whose foolishness threatens to
unleash the Shambling Bone-Men will not be deliberately bent on
such a goal, that is for children's books. This truly dangerous
wizard shall perhaps be bent on some project of which he
anticipates great renown, and the certain prospect of losing that
renown and living out his life in obscurity will seem to him more
vivid than the unknown prospect of destroying his country. Or he
shall have promised success to one he cannot bear to disappoint.
Perhaps he has children in debt. There is much literary wisdom in
those stories. It is born of harsh experience and cities of ash.
The most likely prospect for disaster is a powerful wizard who, for
whatever reason, cannot bring himself to halt as warning signs
appear. Though he may speak much and loudly of caution, he will not
be able to bring himself actually to halt. I wonder, Mr. Potter,
have you thought of trying anything which Hermione Granger herself
would have told you not to do?"</p>
<p>"All <em>right,</em> point taken," said Harry. "Professor, I am
well aware that if I save Hermione at the price of two other
people's lives, I've lost on total points from a utilitarian
standpoint. I am <em>extremely</em> aware that Hermione would not
want me to risk destroying a whole country just to save her. That's
just common sense."</p>
<p>"Child who destroys Dementors," said that soft voice, "if it
were only one country I feared you might ruin, I would be less
concerned. I did not at first credit that your knowledge of Muggle
science and Muggle practices would be a source of great power. I
now credit it more. I am, in complete sincerity, concerned for the
safety of that golden plaque."</p>
<p>"Well, if science fiction has taught me anything," said Harry,
"it's taught me that destroying the Solar System is not morally
acceptable, especially if you do it before humanity has colonized
any other star systems."</p>
<p>"Then will you give up this -"</p>
<p>"No," Harry said without even thinking before he opened his
mouth. After a moment, he added, "But I do understand what you're
trying to tell me."</p>
<p>Silence. The stars had not shifted, not even as they would have
in an Earthly night sky, over time.</p>
<p>A very slight rustle, as of someone shifting their body. Harry
realized that he had been standing for a while in the same
position, and dropped down to the almost unseeable circle of grass
that still stayed beneath him, careful not to touch the edges of
the spell.</p>
<p>"Tell me this," said the soft voice. "Why does that girl matter
to you so much?"</p>
<p>"Because she is my friend."</p>
<p>"In the English language as it is customarily used, Mr. Potter,
the word 'friend' is not associated with a desperate effort to
raise the dead. Are you under the impression that she is your true
love, or some such?"</p>
<p>"Oh, not you too," Harry said wearily. "Not you of all people,
Professor. Fine, we're best friends, but that's <em>all,</em> okay?
That's enough. Friends don't let friends stay dead."</p>
<p>"Ordinary folk do not do as much, for those they call friends."
The voice sounded more distant now, abstracted. "Not even for those
they say they love. Their companions die, and they do not go in
search of power to resurrect them."</p>
<p>Harry couldn't help himself. He looked over again, despite
knowing it would be futile, and saw only more stars. "Let me guess,
from this you deduce that... people don't actually care as much
about their friends as they pretend."</p>
<p>A brief laugh. "They would scarcely pretend to care
<em>less</em>."</p>
<p>"They care, Professor, and not just for their true loves.
Soldiers throw themselves on grenades to save their friends,
mothers run into burning houses to save their children. But if
you're a Muggle you don't think there's any such thing as magic to
bring someone back to life. And normal wizards don't... <em>think
outside the box</em> like that. I mean, most wizards aren't
searching for power to make <em>themselves</em> immortal. Does that
prove they don't care about their own lives?"</p>
<p>"As you say, Mr. Potter. Certainly I myself would consider their
lives pointless and without a shred of value. Perhaps, somewhere in
their hidden hearts, they also believe that my opinion of them is
the correct one."</p>
<p>Harry shook his head, and then, in annoyance, cast back the hood
of his Cloak, and shook his head again. "That seems like a rather
<em>contrived</em> view of the world, Professor," said the dim-lit
head of a boy, floating unsupported on a circle of dark grass amid
stars. "Trying to invent a resurrection spell just isn't something
normal people would think of, so you can't deduce anything from
their not taking the option."</p>
<p>A moment later, the dim-lit outline of a man sitting on the
circle of grass was visible as well.</p>
<p>"If they <em>truly</em> cared about their supposed loved ones,"
the Defense Professor said softly, "they would think of it, would
they not?"</p>
<p>"Brains don't work that way. They don't suddenly supercharge
when the stakes go up - or when they do, it's within hard limits. I
couldn't calculate the thousandth digit of pi if someone's life
depended on it."</p>
<p>The dim-lit head inclined. "But there is another possible
explanation, Mr. Potter. It is that people play the <em>role</em>
of friendship. They do just as much as that role requires of them,
and no more. The thought occurs to me that perhaps the difference
between you and them is not that you care more than they do. Why
would you have been born with such unusually strong emotions of
friendship, that you alone among wizardkind are driven to resurrect
Hermione Granger after her death? No, the most likely difference is
not that you care more. It is that, being a more logical creature
than they, you alone have thought that playing the role of Friend
would require this of you."</p>
<p>Harry stared out at the stars. He would have been lying if he'd
claimed not to be shaken. "That... can't be true, Professor. I
could name a dozen examples in Muggle novels of people driven to
resurrect their dead friends. The authors of those stories clearly
understood exactly how I feel about Hermione. Though you wouldn't
have read them, I guess... maybe Orpheus and Eurydice? I didn't
actually read that one but I know what's in it."</p>
<p>"Such tales are also told among wizardkind. There is the story
of the Elric brothers. The tale of Dora Kent, who was protected by
her son Saul. There is Ronald Mallett and his doomed challenge to
Time. In Sicily before its fall, the drama of Precia Testarossa. In
Nippon they tell of Akemi Homura and her lost love. What these
stories have in common, Mr. Potter, is that they are all
<em>fiction.</em> Real-life wizards do not attempt the same, even
though the notion is clearly <em>not</em> beyond their
imagination."</p>
<p>"Because they don't think they <em>can!</em> " Harry's voice
rose.</p>
<p>"Shall we go and tell the good Professor McGonagall about your
intention to find a way to resurrect Miss Granger, and see what she
thinks of it? Perhaps it has simply never occurred to her to
consider that option... Ah, but you hesitate. You already know her
answer, Mr. Potter. Do you know why you know it?" You could hear
the cold smile in the voice. "A lovely technique, that. Thank you
for teaching it to me."</p>
<p>Harry was aware of the tension that had developed in his face,
his words came out as though bitten off. "Professor McGonagall has
not grown up with the Muggle concept of the increasing power of
science, and nobody's ever told her that when a friend's life is at
stake is a time when you need to <em>think very rationally</em>
-"</p>
<p>The Defense Professor's voice was also rising. "The
Transfiguration Professor is <em>reading from a script,</em> Mr.
Potter! That script calls for her to mourn and grieve, that all may
know how much she cared. Ordinary people react poorly if you
suggest that they go off-script. As you already knew!"</p>
<p>"That's funny, I could have sworn I saw Professor McGonagall
going off-script at dinner yesterday. If I saw her go off-script
another ten times I might actually try to talk to her about
resurrecting Hermione, but right now she's new to that and needs
practice. In the end, Professor, what you're trying to explain away
by calling love and friendship and everything else a lie is just
<em>human beings not knowing any better.</em>"</p>
<p>The Defense Professor's voice rose in pitch. "If it were you who
had been killed by that troll, it would not even <em>occur</em> to
Hermione Granger to do as you are doing for her! It would not occur
to Draco Malfoy, nor to Neville Longbottom, nor to McGonagall or
any of your precious friends! There is not one person in this world
who would return to you the care that you are showing her! So
<em>why?</em> Why do it, Mr. Potter?" There was a strange, wild
desperation in that voice. "Why be the only one in the world who
goes to such lengths to keep up the pretense, when none of them
will ever do the same for you?"</p>
<p>"I believe you are factually mistaken, Professor," Harry
returned evenly. "About a number of things, in fact. At the very
least, your model of my emotions is flawed. Because you don't
understand me the tiniest bit, if you think that it would stop me
if everything you said was <em>true.</em> Everything in the world
has to start somewhere, every event that happens has to happen for
a first time. Life on Earth had to start with some little
self-replicating molecule in a pool of mud. And if I were the first
person in the world, no -"</p>
<p>Harry's hand swept out, to indicate the terribly distant points
of light.</p>
<p>"- if I were the first person in the <em>universe</em> who ever
really cared about someone else, which I'm <em>not</em> by the way,
then I'd be honored to be that person, and I'd try to do it
justice."</p>
<p>There was a long silence.</p>
<p>"You truly do care about that girl," the man's dim outline said
softly. "You care about her in the way that none of <em>them</em>
are capable of caring for their own lives, let alone each other."
The Defense Professor's voice had become strange, filled with some
indecipherable emotion. "I do not understand it, but I know the
lengths you will go to because of it. You will challenge death
itself, for her. Nothing will sway you from that."</p>
<p>"I care enough to make an actual effort," Harry said quietly.
"Yes, that is correct."</p>
<p>The starlight slowly began to fracture, the world shining
through the cracks; slashes through the night showing treetrunks
and leaves glowing in the sunlight. Harry raised a hand, blinking
hard, as the returning brightness smashed into his dark-adjusted
eyes; and his eyes automatically went to the Defense Professor,
just in case an attack occurred while he was blinded.</p>
<p>When all the stars had gone and only daylight remained,
Professor Quirrell was still sitting on the grass. "Well, Mr.
Potter," he said in his normal voice, "if that is so, then I shall
give you what help I can, while I can."</p>
<p>"You'll <em>what?</em> " Harry said involuntarily.</p>
<p>"My offer as I made it yesterday still stands. Ask and I will
answer. Show me the same science books you deemed suitable for Mr.
Malfoy, and I shall look them over and tell you what comes to mind.
Don't look so surprised, Mr. Potter, I would hardly leave you to
your own devices."</p>
<p>Harry stared, tear ducts still watering from the sudden
light.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell looked back at him. Something strange glinted
in the pale eyes. "I have done what I can, and now I fear I must
take my leave of you. Good -" and the Defense Professor hesitated.
"Good day, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>"Good -" Harry began.</p>
<p>The man sitting on the grass fell over, his head impacting the
ground with a light thud. At the same time the sense of doom
diminished so sharply that Harry leapt to his feet, his heart
suddenly in his throat.</p>
<p>But the figure on the ground slowly pushed back up to a crawling
position. Turned to look at Harry, eyes empty, mouth slack. Tried
to stand, fell back to the ground.</p>
<p>Harry took a step forward, sheer instinct telling him to offer a
hand, although that was incorrect; the apprehension that rose up in
him, however faint, spoke of continued danger.</p>
<p>But the fallen figure flinched away from Harry, and then slowly
began crawl to away from him, in the general direction of the
distant castle.</p>
<p>The boy standing amid the forest gazed after.</p>

<p>There was nothing left to do.</p>
<p>There was nothing left to plan.</p>
<p>There was nothing left to think.</p>
<p>Into that emptiness rose the new worst memory -</p>
<p>The Boy-Who-Lived-Unlike-His-Best-Friend trudged the long,
echoing corridors toward the Great Hall. With all his energies of
thought exhausted, his mind was starting to throw out thoughts like
an image of Hermione walking beside him and wordless concepts like
<em>That will never happen again</em> until another part yelled
<em>No</em> and shouted it down with determination to bring her
back, only that part's voice was getting tired and the other part
seemed tireless. Another part of his mind insisted on reviewing
what he'd said to Professor McGonagall and Dad and Mum, even though
he'd only been trying to get them out of there as quickly as
possible and had been running on limited mental energy. As though
somehow he could have done better, by an act of his defective will.
What would be left of his relationship with his parents now, Harry
couldn't guess.</p>
<p>He came finally to a junction where there waited a older boy in
green-fringed black robes, silently reading a textbook, on the path
that anyone would pick if they wanted to intercept someone going
from the healer's chambers to the Great Hall.</p>
<p>Harry was wearing the Cloak of Invisibility, of course, he'd put
it on after leaving the office, rendering himself immune to almost
all forms of magical detection. There was no point in making it
easy for anyone trying to find him and kill him. And Harry was
almost set to continue past without bothering to find out what was
going on, when he recognized the Slytherin boy's face.</p>
<p>Realization dawned on Harry then. Of course, one of the students
who had stayed in school over the Easter holiday would naturally
have been -</p>
<p>"You were waiting for me," Harry said out loud, without removing
the Cloak.</p>
<p>The Slytherin boy jerked back, hitting his head against the
wall, his fifth-year Charms textbook dropping from his hands,
before he looked up with wide eyes.</p>
<p>"You're -"</p>
<p>"Invisible. Yes. Say what you mean to say."</p>
<p>Lesath Lestrange scrambled to his feet, a position of attention,
then blurted out, "My lord, did I do the right thing - I thought
you would not wish me to step forward before all those others, that
they might suspect our connection - I thought, surely if you wished
my help you would call on me -"</p>
<p>It was amazing how many different ways there were to kill your
best friend by being stupid.</p>
<p>"I -" Lesath hesitated, then said in a small voice, "I was
wrong, wasn't I?"</p>
<p>"You acted exactly as you should have, under the circumstances.
It is I who was a fool."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, my lord," whispered Lesath.</p>
<p>"If you <em>had</em> come with me, would you have been able to
kill the troll?" It wasn't even the correct question, the correct
question was whether Harry himself would have considered Lesath as
sufficient and flown out sixty seconds earlier, but still...</p>
<p>"I... I'm not sure, my lord... I am not much welcome to duelling
practices in Slytherin, I have not learned the gestures to the
Killing Curse - should I study those arts to better serve you, my
lord?"</p>
<p>"I continue to insist that I am not your lord," Harry said.</p>
<p>"Yes, my lord."</p>
<p>"Although," Harry said, "and this is not any kind of order, just
a remark, anyone ought to know how to defend themselves, especially
you. I'm sure the Defense Professor would help you with that on
general principles, if you asked."</p>
<p>Lesath Lestrange bowed and said, "Yes, my lord, I will follow
your orders if I can, my lord."</p>
<p>Harry would have complained about being misunderstood, if he
hadn't been understood perfectly.</p>
<p>Lesath left.</p>
<p>Harry stared at the wall.</p>
<p>He'd honestly thought that he'd already figured out all the
different ways that he'd been stupid, after spending half a day
thinking about it.</p>
<p>Apparently this had just been more overconfidence on his
part.</p>
<p><em>Do we understand what we did wrong?</em> his Slytherin side
said coldly.</p>
<p><em>Yes,</em> Harry thought.</p>
<p><em>Your ethical qualms don't even make sense. You're not
tricking Lesath. You did exactly what Lesath thinks you did. You
wouldn't have to make excuses for why Lesath was helping you, you
could just say you were calling in the debt from rescuing him from
bullies, there were six witnesses to that. Hermione died because
you forgot about an extremely valuable resource, and you forgot
about Lesath because... why?</em></p>
<p><em>Because having Lesath Lestrange for a minion seemed sort of
Dark-Lordish?</em> Hufflepuff said in a small mental voice. <em>I
mean... that decision was probably mostly me...</em></p>
<p>Harry's Slytherin side didn't answer that in words, just
radiated contempt and flashed an image of Hermione's corpse.</p>
<p><em>Stop it!</em> Harry screamed internally.</p>
<p><em>Next time,</em> Slytherin said icily, <em>I suggest that we
spend more time worrying about what is efficient and effective, and
less time worrying about what seems sort of Dark-Lordish.</em></p>
<p><em>Point made,</em> Harry thought, <em>I will.</em></p>
<p><em>No, you won't,</em> said Slytherin. <em>You'll come up with
more rationalisations for your petty qualms. You'll start listening
to me after your</em> next <em>friend dies.</em></p>
<p>Harry was starting to worry that he was going insane. The
conversations he had with the voices in his head weren't usually
like this.</p>
<p>The Boy-Who-Lived</p>
<p><em>pain</em></p>
<p>Harry Verres trudged on alone</p>
<p><em>hurts</em></p>
<p>Harry walked on through the silent corridors.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"How is Mr. Potter doing?" demanded Professor Quirrell. There
was a tension about the man, you could not quite call it
<em>concern,</em> more like an ambusher measuring the time to
strike. The Grangers had hardly left with Madam Pomfrey before the
Defense Professor had knocked upon the door to her office and then
entered without waiting for her answer, and spoken before she could
say a word. Part of Minerva wondered distantly whether Harry Potter
had picked up that habit from his Defense Professor, being unaware
of others' pain when there was something else on his mind, or if it
was only a childish flaw which this man had somehow failed to grow
out of.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter has ceased guarding Miss Granger's body," she said,
putting some of the chill she felt into her voice. She felt certain
that the Defense Professor was not experiencing as much grief as
she was, the man had spoken not a single word of Hermione Granger.
For <em>him</em> to put demands on her - "I believe he has gone
down to dinner."</p>
<p>"I am not asking after the boy's <em>physical</em> state! Have
you - has he -" Professor Quirrell made a sharp gesture, as though
to indicate a concept for which he had no words.</p>
<p>"Not particularly," she said. She was around thirty seconds away
from ordering the Defense Professor out of her office.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell began to pace within the small confines of
her office. "Miss Granger was the only one whose worries he truly
heeded - with her gone - all checks on the boy's recklessness are
removed. I see it now. Who else is there? Mr. Longbottom? Mr.
Potter does not pretend that they are peers. Flitwick? His goblin
blood would only cry for vengeance. Mr. Malfoy, if he were
returned? To what end? Snape? A walking disaster. Dumbledore? Pfah.
Events are already set for catastrophe, they must be steered along
some course they would not naturally go. Who might Mr. Potter heed,
who would not ordinarily speak to him? Cedric Diggory has taught
him, but what would Mr. Diggory say in advice? An unknown. Mr.
Potter spent long in speech with Remus Lupin. To him I have paid
little heed. Would Lupin know the words to speak, the act which
must be done, the sacrifice which must be made to change the boy's
course?" Professor Quirrell whirled on her. "Did Remus Lupin
comfort those in grief or stay those moved to rash deeds, during
his time with the Order of the Phoenix?"</p>
<p>"It is not a poor thought," she said slowly. "I believe that Mr.
Lupin was often a voice of restraint to James Potter in his
Hogwarts days."</p>
<p>"James Potter," said Professor Quirrell, his eyes narrowing.
"The boy is not much like James Potter. Are you confident in the
success of this plan? No, that is the wrong question, we are not
limited to a single plan. Are you certain that this plan will be
<em>enough,</em> that we need essay no others? Asked in such
fashion, the question answers itself. The path leading to disaster
must be averted along every possible point of intervention." The
Defense Professor had resumed pacing the confines of her office,
reaching one wall, turning on his heel, pacing to the other.</p>
<p>"My apologies, Professor," she did not bother keeping the
sharpness from her voice, "but I have quite reached my limits for
the day. You may go."</p>
<p>"<em>You</em>." Professor Quirrell spun, and she found herself
gazing directly into eyes of icy blue. "<em>You</em> would be the
first one I would think of after Miss Granger, to stay the boy from
a folly. Have you already done your utmost? Of course you have
not."</p>
<p>How <em>dare</em> he suggest that. "If you have nothing more to
say, Professor, then you <em>will</em> go."</p>
<p>"Has your confederacy deduced who I really am?" The words were
spoken with deceptive mildness.</p>
<p>"Yes, in fact. Now -"</p>
<p>Pure magic, pure power crashed into the room like a flash of
lightning, like a thunderclap echoing about her ears that deafened
her other senses, the papers on her desk blown aside not by any
conjured wind but by the sheer raw force of arcane might.</p>
<p>Then the power subsided, leaving only Hermione Granger's death
certificates drifting down through the air to the floor.</p>
<p>"I am David Monroe, who fought Voldemort," the man said, still
in mild tones. "Heed my words. The boy cannot be allowed to
continue in this state of mind. He will become <em>dangerous</em>.
It is possible that you have already done everything you can. Yet I
find this a very rare event indeed, and more often said than done.
I suspect rather that you have only done what you customarily do. I
cannot truly comprehend what drives others to break their bounds,
since I never had them. People remain surprisingly passive when
faced with the prospect of death. Fear of public ridicule or losing
one's livelihood is more likely to drive men to extremes and the
breaking of their customary habits. On the other side of the war,
the Dark Lord had excellent results from the Cruciatus Curse,
judiciously used on Marked servants who cannot escape punishment
except by success, with no reasonable efforts accepted. Imagine
their state of mind within yourself, and ask yourself whether you
have truly done <em>all that you can</em> to wrench Harry Potter
from his course."</p>
<p>"I am a Gryffindor and not much given to being moved by fear,"
she snapped back. "<em>You</em> will exercise courtesy within my
office!"</p>
<p>"I find fear an excellent motivation, and indeed it is fear that
moves me now. You-Know-Who, for all his horror, still abided by
certain boundaries. It is my professional judgment, speaking as a
learned wizard almost on par with Dumbledore or
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, that the boy could join the ranks of
those whose rituals are inscribed upon the tombstones of countries.
This is not an idle worry, McGonagall, I have already heard words
to produce the gravest apprehensions."</p>
<p>"Are you mad? You think that Mr. Potter could - this is
ridiculous. Mr. Potter cannot possibly -"</p>
<p>A wordless image crossed her mind of a patch of glass on a steel
ball.</p>
<p>"- Mr. Potter <em>would</em> not do such a thing!"</p>
<p>"His deliberate choice is not required. Wizards rarely set out
to invoke their own dooms. Mr. Potter may not strike you as
malicious. Does he strike you as reckless once he is resolved upon
a goal? I say again that I have specific reason for the gravest
<em>possible</em> concerns!"</p>
<p>"Have you spoken to the Headmaster of this?" she said
slowly.</p>
<p>"That would be worse than pointless. Dumbledore cannot reach the
boy. At best he is wise enough to know this and make things no
worse. I lack the requisite frame of mind. <em>You</em> are the one
who - but I see that you still look for others to save you." The
Defense Professor turned from her, and strode to the door. "I think
I shall consult with Severus Snape. The man may be a walking
disaster, but he knows the fact, and he may possess a greater
understanding of that boy's mood. As for you, madam, imagine
yourself at the end of your life, knowing that Britain - but no,
Britain is not your true country, is it? Imagine yourself at the
end of your life as the darkness eats through the fading walls of
Hogwarts, knowing that your students will die with you, remembering
this day and realizing there was something else you could have
done."</p>

<p>For the second time that day, Harry's eyes filled with tears.
Heedless of the puzzled eyes of the Ravenclaws in the common room,
he reached out to the silver creature which Draco Malfoy had sent,
cradling it in his arms like a live thing; and stumbled off in the
direction of his dorm room, heading half-blindly for the bottom of
his trunk, as the silver snake waited silently in his arms.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>The fifth meeting: 10:12am, Sunday, April 19th.</em></p>
<p>The debtor's meeting which Lord Malfoy had demanded from Harry
Potter, who owed Lucius Malfoy a debt of some 58,203 Galleons, was
held within the Gringotts Central Bank, in accordance with the laws
of Britain.</p>
<p>There had been some pushback from Chief Warlock Dumbledore,
trying to prevent Harry Potter from leaving the security of
Hogwarts (a phrase that caused Harry Potter to raise his fingers
and silently make quote marks in the air). For his own part, the
Boy-Who-Lived had seemingly pondered quietly, and then assented to
the meeting, strangely compliant in the face of his enemy's
demand.</p>
<p>The Headmaster of Hogwarts, who acted as Harry Potter's legal
guardian in the eyes of magical Britain, had overruled his ward's
assent.</p>
<p>The Debts Committee of the Wizengamot had overruled the
Headmaster of Hogwarts.</p>
<p>The Chief Warlock had overruled the Debts Committee.</p>
<p>The Wizengamot had overruled the Chief Warlock.</p>
<p>And so the Boy-Who-Lived had departed under the heavy guard of
Mad-Eye Moody and an Auror trio for the Gringotts Central Bank;
with Moody's bright-blue eye rotating wildly in every direction, as
though to signal to any possible attacker that he was On Guard and
Constantly Vigilant and would cheerfully incinerate the kidneys of
anyone who sneezed in the general direction of the
Boy-Who-Lived.</p>
<p>Harry Potter watched more keenly than before, as they marched
through the wide-open front doors of Gringotts, beneath the motto
<em>Fortius Quo Fidelius</em>. On Harry's last three visits to
Gringotts he had merely admired the marble pillars, the
gold-burning torchlights, the architecture not quite like the human
parts of magical Britain. Since then had come the Incident at
Azkaban and other things; and now, on his fourth visit, Harry was
thinking about the Goblin Rebellions and goblins' ongoing
resentment at not being allowed to own wands and certain facts
which hadn't been in the first-year History textbook, which Harry
had guessed at by pattern-matching and which Professor Flitwick had
confirmed in a very quiet voice. Lord Voldemort had killed goblins
as well as wizards - an incredibly stupid move on Lord Voldemort's
part, unless Harry was really missing something - but what goblins
thought of the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry had no idea. Goblins had a
reputation for paying what they owed and taking what they thought
owed them, along with a reputation for interpreting those accounts
in a somewhat prejudiced fashion.</p>
<p>Today, the guards standing upright in armor at regular intervals
around the bank were staring at the Boy-Who-Lived with blank faces,
and glaring at Moody and the Aurors with flashes of bitter
contempt. At the stands and counters of the bank's foyer, goblin
tellers stared with equal contempt at the wizards whose hands they
were filling with Galleons; one teller smiled a sharp-toothed grin
at a witch who was looking angry and desperate.</p>
<p><em>If I understand human nature correctly - and if I'm right
that all the humanoid magical species are genetically human plus a
heritable magical effect - then you're not likely to become friends
with a wizard just because I'm polite to you, or say that I'm
sympathetic. But</em> <em>I wonder if you would back the
Boy-Who-Lived in a bid to overthrow the Ministry, if I promised to
revoke the Wand Law afterward... or if I quietly gave you wands,
and spellbooks, in exchange for your support... is that why the
secret of wand-making is restricted to people like Ollivander?
Though if you really are human, just plain human, then the goblin
nation probably has its own internal horrors, its own Azkabans, for
that is also human nature; in which case sooner or later I must
overthrow or reform your own government as well. Hm.</em></p>
<p>An aged goblin appeared before them, and Harry inclined his head
with careful courtesy, a gesture that the aged goblin returned with
an abrupt half-nod. There was no wild train ride; instead the aged
goblin ushered them into a short hallway that terminated in a small
waiting room, with three goblin-sized benches and one wizard-sized
chair, within which nobody sat.</p>
<p>"Do not sign anything that Lucius Malfoy gives you," Mad-Eye
Moody said. "<em>Nothing,</em> do you understand me, lad? If Malfoy
hands you a copy of <em>The Wonderful Adventures of the
Boy-Who-Lived</em> and asks you for an autograph, tell him that
you've sprained a finger. Don't pick up a quill for a single second
while you're in Gringotts. If someone hands you a quill, break the
quill and then break your own fingers. Do I need to explain
further, son?"</p>
<p>"Not particularly," Harry said. "We also have lawyers in Muggle
Britain, and they'd think your lawyers are cute."</p>
<p>A short time later Harry Potter handed his wand over to an
armored goblin guard who frisked him with all manner of
interesting-looking probes, and gave his pouch to Moody to
keep.</p>
<p>And then Harry stepped through another door, and a brief
waterfall of Thief's Downfall, which evaporated from his skin as
soon as he stepped out.</p>
<p>On the other side of the door was a larger room, richly paneled
and appointed, with a great golden table stretching across it; two
huge leather chairs on one side of the table, and a small wooden
stool on the other, the debtor's perch. Two goblins in full armor,
wearing ornate earpieces and glasses, stood watch around the room.
Neither side would have wands or any other device of magic, and the
goblin guards would attack immediately if anyone dared to use
wandless magic within this peaceable meeting supervised by
Gringotts Bank. The ornate earpieces would prevent the goblin
guards from hearing the conversation unless directly addressed, the
eyepieces would leave the wizards' faces as blurs. It was, in
short, something along the lines of <em>actual</em> security, at
least if you were an Occlumens.</p>
<p>Harry climbed up onto his uncomfortable wooden stool, thinking
<em>Subtle</em> in a tone of some mental sarcasm, and awaited his
creditors.</p>
<p>It was only a brief interval later, much shorter than the time a
debtor could legally be made to wait, when Lucius Malfoy entered
into the room, taking up his leather chair with motions worn smooth
by practice. His snake-headed cane was missing from his hands, his
long white mane drifted behind him the same as ever, his face could
not be read.</p>
<p>Quietly following behind him was a young boy with white-blonde
hair, now wearing black robes far finer than any Hogwarts uniform,
who followed in his father's footsteps with a controlled face. A
boy who was also Harry's creditor to the tune of forty Galleons,
and also of House Malfoy, and therefore, technically, covered by
the Wizengamot resolution enabling this meeting.</p>
<p><em>Draco.</em> Harry didn't say it aloud, didn't let his own
expression change. He could not think of what to say. Not even
<em>I'm sorry</em> seemed appropriate. Harry hadn't dared say any
of that to Draco's Patronus either, when they had set up this
meeting in a few brief exchanges; and not only because Lucius might
be listening. It had been enough to know that Draco's happy thought
was still happy, and that he had still been able to want Harry to
know it.</p>
<p>Lucius Malfoy spoke first, his voice level, his face set. "I do
not understand what is happening at Hogwarts, Harry Potter. Would
you care to explain it to me?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," Harry said. "If I understood these events I
would not have let them happen, Lord Malfoy."</p>
<p>"Then answer me this question. <em>Who</em> are you?"</p>
<p>Harry gazed evenly at the face of his creditor. "I'm not
You-Know-Who, like you thought I was," Harry said. Not being a
<em>complete</em> idiot, he'd eventually worked out who Lucius
Malfoy had thought he was talking to in front of the Wizengamot.
"Obviously I'm not a normal boy. Equally obviously, that probably
has <em>something</em> to do with the Boy-Who-Lived business. But I
don't know what, or why, any more than you do. I asked the Sorting
Hat and it didn't know either."</p>
<p>Lucius Malfoy nodded distantly. "I could not think of any reason
why you would pay a hundred thousand Galleons to save a mudblood's
life. No reason save one, which would account for her power and
bloodthirst alike; but then she died at the hands of a troll, and
yet you lived. And also my <em>son</em> has told me <em>much</em>
of you, Harry Potter, which <em>did not make the tiniest bit of
sense,</em> I have heard the ravings of the mad in St. Mungo's and
they were more sensible by far than the events which my
<em>son</em> told me under <em>Veritaserum</em> that you enacted,
and that portion of this <em>raving lunacy,</em> which you
<em>personally carried out,</em> I would have you explain to me,
and now."</p>
<p>Harry turned to look at Draco, who looked back at him with a
face that was screwing up, being controlled, and then tensing up
again.</p>
<p>"I'd also," Draco Malfoy said in a high and wavering voice,
"like, to know, why, Potter."</p>
<p>Harry closed his eyes, and spoke without looking. "A boy raised
by Muggles who thought he was clever. You saw me, Draco, and you
thought of how very useful it would be if the Boy-Who-Lived, out of
all the other children in your year, could be shown the truth of
things, if we could be friends. And I thought the same thing about
you. Only, you and I believed different things were true. Not that
I'm saying that there are different truths, I mean, there's
different beliefs but there's only one reality, only one universe
that can make those beliefs true or false -"</p>
<p>"You lied to me."</p>
<p>Harry opened his eyes and looked at Draco. "I would prefer to
say," Harry said, not quite with a steady voice, "that the things I
told you were true from a certain point of view."</p>
<p><em>"A certain point of view?"</em> Draco Malfoy looked every
bit as angry as Luke Skywalker'd had the right to be, and not in a
mood to accept Kenobi's excuses, either. "There's a word for things
that are true from a certain point of view. They're called
<em>lies!</em> "</p>
<p>"Or tricks," Harry said evenly. "Statements which are
technically true but which deceive the listener into forming
further beliefs which are false. I think it's worth making that
distinction. What I told you was a self-fulfilling prophecy; you
believed that you couldn't deceive yourself, so you didn't try. The
skills you've learned are real, and it would have been very bad for
you to start fighting against them internally. People can't make
themselves believe that blue is green by an act of will, but they
<em>think</em> they can, and that can be almost as bad."</p>
<p>"You <em>used</em> me," said Draco Malfoy.</p>
<p>"I only used you in ways that made you stronger. That's what it
means to be used by a friend."</p>
<p><em>"Even I know that's not what friendship is!"</em></p>
<p>Now Lucius Malfoy spoke again. "For what purpose? To what end?"
Even the elder Malfoy's voice was not quite steady.
"<em>Why?"</em></p>
<p>Harry regarded him for a moment, and then turned to Draco. "Your
father's probably not going to believe this," Harry said. "But you,
Draco, should be able to see that everything which has happened is
compatible with this hypothesis. And that any more cynical
hypothesis wouldn't explain why I didn't press you harder when you
thought I had leverage, or why I taught you so much. I thought that
the heir of House Malfoy, who'd been publicly seen to grab a
Muggleborn girl to stop her falling off the roof of Hogwarts, would
be a good compromise candidate to lead magical Britain after the
reformation."</p>
<p>"So you would have me believe," Lucius Malfoy said in a thin
voice, "that you are claiming to be mad. Well, let us leave all
that aside. Tell me who set that troll on Hogwarts."</p>
<p>"I don't know," Harry said.</p>
<p>"Tell me who you <em>suspect,</em> Harry Potter."</p>
<p>"I have four suspects. One of them is Professor Snape -"</p>
<p>"<em>Snape?</em> " Draco burst out.</p>
<p>"The second, of course, is the Defense Professor of Hogwarts,
just because he's the Defense Professor." Harry would have left him
out, not wanting to bring Professor Quirrell to the Malfoys'
attention if he was innocent, but Draco might have called him on
that. "The third, you wouldn't believe me about. The fourth is a
catchall category called Everything Else." <em>And the fifth, Lord
Voldemort, I do not think I should name to you.</em></p>
<p>Lucius Malfoy's face contorted in a snarl. "Do you think I
cannot recognize bait upon your hook? Tell me about this third
possibility, Potter, the one you wish me to believe is the
<em>true</em> answer, and leave aside games."</p>
<p>Harry regarded Lord Malfoy steadily. "I once read a book I
wasn't supposed to read, and it told me this: Communication is an
event that takes place between equals. Employees lie to their
bosses, who, in turn, expect to be lied to. I'm not playing coy,
I'm observing that it's simply not possible, in our present
situation, for me to tell you about the third suspect, and have you
believe that my story was anything but a lure."</p>
<p>Draco spoke then. "It's Father, isn't it?"</p>
<p>Harry gave Draco a startled look.</p>
<p>Draco spoke evenly. "You suspect that Father sent the troll into
Hogwarts to get at Granger, don't you? That's what you're thinking,
isn't it!"</p>
<p>Harry opened his mouth to say, <em>Actually, no,</em> and then
managed to think ahead and stop himself for once in his life.</p>
<p>"I see..." Harry said slowly. "<em>That's</em> what this is
about. Lucius Malfoy publicly says that Hermione won't get away
with what she's done, and lo and behold, a troll kills her." Harry
smiled then, in a way that bared his teeth. "And if I deny that
here, then Draco, who isn't an Occlumens, can then testify under
Veritaserum that the Boy-Who-Lived does <em>not</em> suspect Lucius
Malfoy of having sent a troll into Hogwarts to kill Hermione
Granger, sworn to the Noble House of Potter, whose blood debt was
recently purchased for a hundred thousand Galleons et cetera."
Harry leaned back slightly, though his wooden stool had no back
with which to do it properly. "But now that it's been pointed out,
I see that it's very reasonable. Obviously <em>you</em> killed
Hermione Granger, just like you threatened to do in front of the
whole Wizengamot."</p>
<p>"I did not," Lucius Malfoy said, expressionless once more.</p>
<p>Harry bared his teeth again in that non-smile. "Well then, in
<em>that</em> case, there must be someone <em>else</em> out there
who killed Hermione and messed with the Hogwarts wards, the same
person who <em>earlier</em> tried to <em>frame Hermione for Draco
Malfoy's murder.</em> Either you killed Hermione Granger after
being paid for her life, or you blamed your son's attempted murder
on an innocent girl and took all my family's money under false
pretenses, one of those two things must be true."</p>
<p>"Perhaps <em>you</em> killed her in hopes of your money being
returned." Lucius Malfoy had leaned forward, and was staring hard
at Harry.</p>
<p>"Then <em>I</em> would not have given away my money for her in
the first place. As you already know. Don't insult my intelligence,
Lord Malfoy - no, wait, sorry, you just had to <em>say</em> that in
case Draco had to testify to it, never mind."</p>
<p>Lucius Malfoy sat back in his chair and stared.</p>
<p>"I tried to tell you, Father," Draco said under his breath, "but
nobody can imagine Harry Potter until they've actually <em>met</em>
him..."</p>
<p>Harry tapped a finger on his cheek. "So people are starting to
figure out the blatantly obvious? I'm surprised, actually. I
wouldn't have predicted that would happen." Harry had by now caught
the general rhythm of Professor Quirrell's cynicism and was able to
generate it independently. "I wouldn't think a newspaper would be
able to report on a concept like 'Either X or Y must be true, but
we don't know which.' I would only expect journalists to report
stories consisting of series of atomic propositions, like 'X is
true', 'Y is false', or 'X is true and Y is false'. Not more
complex logical connectors like 'If X is true then Y is true, but
we don't know whether X is true'. And all your supporters ought to
be rapidly switching between 'You can't prove that Lord Malfoy
killed Granger, it could've been someone else' and 'You can't prove
there was someone else to frame Granger', so long as it's uncertain
they should be trying to have it both ways at once... wait, don't
you <em>own</em> the Daily Prophet?"</p>
<p>"The Daily Prophet," Lucius Malfoy said thinly, "which I
certainly do not own, is far too respectable to publish any such
scurrilous nonsense. Unfortunately, not all wizards of influence
are so reasonable."</p>
<p>"Ah. Got it." Harry nodded.</p>
<p>Lucius glanced at Draco. "The rest of what he said - was any of
it important?"</p>
<p>"No, Father, it was not."</p>
<p>"Thank you, son." Lucius returned his gaze to Harry. His voice,
when he spoke, was something closer to his usual drawl, cool and
confident. "It is possible that I could be persuaded to show you
some favor, if you admitted before the Wizengamot what you clearly
know, that I was not responsible for this deed. I would be willing
to reduce your remaining debt to House Malfoy quite significantly,
or even adjust the terms to allow later repayment."</p>
<p>Harry regarded Lucius Malfoy steadily. "Lucius Malfoy. You are
now perfectly aware that Hermione Granger was, in fact, framed
using your son as bait, that she was False-Memory-Charmed or worse,
and that House Potter held nothing against you before that. My
counterproposal is that you return my family's money, I announce
before the Wizengamot that House Potter holds House Malfoy no
animus, and we present a united front against whoever's doing this.
We decide to screw the roles we're supposed to play, and ally with
each other instead of fighting. It could be the one thing the enemy
doesn't expect us to do."</p>
<p>There was a brief silence in the room, except for the two goblin
guards who went on breathing regardless.</p>
<p>"You <em>are</em> mad," Lucius Malfoy said coldly.</p>
<p>"It's called justice, Lord Malfoy. You cannot possibly expect me
to cooperate with you while you are holding the wealth of House
Potter under what you now know to be false pretenses. I understand
how it looked to you at the time, but you know better now."</p>
<p>"You have nothing to offer me worth a hundred thousand
Galleons."</p>
<p>"Don't I?" Harry said distantly. "I wonder. I think it quite
probable that you care more about the long-term welfare of House
Malfoy than about whichever political issue the last generation's
failed Dark Lord made his personal hobbyhorse." Harry glanced
significantly at Draco. "The next generation is drawing its own
battle lines and forming new alliances. Your son can be frozen out
of that, or he can go straight to the top. Is that worth more to
you than forty thousand Galleons you weren't particularly expecting
and don't particularly need?" Harry smiled thinly. "Forty thousand
Galleons. Two million Muggle pounds sterling. Your son knows some
things about the size of the Muggle economy that might surprise
you. They'd find it amusing, that the fate of a country was
revolving around two million pounds sterling. They'd think it was
cute. And I think much the same, Lord Malfoy. This isn't about me
being desperate. This is about you getting a fair chance to be
fair."</p>
<p>"Oh?" said Lord Malfoy. "And if I refuse your fair chance, what
then?"</p>
<p>Harry shrugged. "Depends what sort of coalition government gets
put together without the Malfoys. If the government can be reformed
peacefully and it would disturb the peace to do otherwise, I'll pay
you the money out of petty cash. Or maybe the Death Eaters will be
retried for past crimes and executed as a matter of justice, as a
result of due legal process, of course."</p>
<p>"You truly are mad," Lucius Malfoy said quietly. "You have no
power, no wealth, and yet you say such things to me."</p>
<p>"Yes, it's silly to think I could scare you. After all, you're
not a Dementor."</p>
<p>And Harry went on smiling. He'd looked it up, and apparently a
bezoar <em>would</em> heal almost any poison if you shoved it into
someone's mouth fast enough. Maybe that wouldn't repair radiation
damage from Transfigured polonium, but then again, maybe it would.
So Harry had looked up the freezing points of various acids, and it
turned out that sulfuric acid would freeze at just ten degrees
Celsius, which meant Harry could buy a liter of acid on the Muggle
market, freeze it solid, and Transfigure it down to a tiny little
unnoticable water-ice chip to be flipped into someone's mouth and
ingested. No bezoar would compensate for that, once the
Transfiguration wore off. Harry had no intention of saying it out
loud, of course, but now that he'd failed decisively to prevent any
deaths during his quest, he had no further intention of being
restrained by the law or even the code of Batman.</p>
<p><em>Last chance to live, Lucius. Ethically speaking, your life
was bought and paid for the day you committed your first atrocity
for the Death Eaters. You're still human and your life still has
intrinsic value, but you no longer have the deontological
protection of an innocent. Any good person is licensed to kill you
now, if they think it'll save net lives in the long run; and I will
conclude as much of you, if you begin to get in my way. Whoever
sent the troll after Granger must have targeted you too and hit you
with some curse that makes former Death Eaters melt into a pile of
goo. Very sad.</em></p>
<p>"Father," Draco said in a small voice. "I think you should
consider it, father."</p>
<p>Lucius Malfoy looked at his son. "You jest."</p>
<p>"It's true. I don't think Potter just made up his books, nobody
could have written all that and there were things in them that I
could check for myself. And if even half of all that is true, he's
right, a hundred thousand Galleons won't mean much. If we give it
to him he really will be friends with House Malfoy again - the way
<em>he</em> thinks of being friends, anyway. And if we don't, he'll
be your enemy, whether it's in his own interests or not, he'll just
go after you. Harry Potter really does think like that. It's not
about money to him, it's about what he thinks is honor."</p>
<p>Harry Potter inclined his head, still smiling.</p>
<p>"But let's get one part of it straight," Draco said, now staring
directly at him. There was a fierce light in his eyes. "<em>You
wronged me.</em> And <em>you owe me.</em>"</p>
<p>"Acknowledged," Harry said quietly. "Conditional on the rest of
it, of course."</p>
<p>Lucius Malfoy opened his mouth to say who-knew-what and then
closed it again. "Mad," he said again.</p>
<p>There was a long father-and-son argument during which Harry
managed to keep his mouth shut.</p>
<p>When it seemed that even Draco wouldn't be able to persuade his
father, Harry spoke up again, and proposed his intended next steps,
if the Houses of Potter and Malfoy could cooperate.</p>
<p>Then came more argument between Lucius and Draco, during which
Harry again stayed silent.</p>
<p>Finally Lucius Malfoy's eyes turned to gaze at Harry. "And you
believe," Lucius Malfoy said, "that you can persuade Longbottom and
Bones to go along with this notion, even if Dumbledore opposes
it."</p>
<p>Harry nodded. "They'll be suspicious of your involvement, of
course. But I'll tell them that it was my plan to start with, and
that should help."</p>
<p>"I suppose," Lucius Malfoy said after a pause, "that I could
have a contract drawn up, absolving you of <em>almost</em> all the
remaining debt, if by some chance I do go along with this mad idea.
It shall need more guarantees, of course -"</p>
<p>Harry promptly reached into his robes and drew out a parchment,
unfolding it and spreading it across the golden table. "I've taken
the liberty myself, actually," Harry said. He'd spent some careful
hours in the Hogwarts library with the law books available.
Thankfully, so far as Harry could tell, the laws of magical Britain
were charmingly simple by Muggle standards. Writing that the
original blood debt and payment was cancelled, the Potters' wealth
and all other vault items would be returned, and the remaining debt
annulled, all with no fault to the Malfoys, was only a few more
lines than it took to say out loud. "I had to promise my keepers
not to sign anything you gave me. So I made sure to compose this
myself, and sign it before I left."</p>
<p>Draco emitted a choked laugh.</p>
<p>Lucius read through the contract, smiling humorlessly. "How
charmingly straightforward."</p>
<p>"I also promised not to touch a quill while I was in Gringotts,"
Harry said. He reached into his robes again and drew out a Muggle
pen, along with a sheet of normal paper. "Will this wording be all
right?" Harry rapidly scribbled down a legal-sounding statement to
the effect that House Potter didn't hold House Malfoy responsible
in any way for Hermione Granger's murder and didn't believe they
had anything to do with it, then held up the paper in the air for
Lord Malfoy's inspection.</p>
<p>Lord Malfoy looked at the paper, rolled his eyes slightly, and
said, "Good enough, I suppose. Though to have the proper meaning,
you should use the legal term <em>indemnify</em> rather than
<em>exonerate</em> -"</p>
<p>"Nice try, but no. I know exactly what that word means, Lord
Malfoy." Harry took his parchment and began copying down his
original wording more carefully.</p>
<p>When Harry was done, Lord Malfoy reached across the golden table
and took the pen, looking at it thoughtfully. "One of your Muggle
artefacts, I suppose? What does this do, son?"</p>
<p>"It writes without needing an inkwell," Draco answered.</p>
<p>"I can see that. I suppose some might find it an amusing
trinket." Lucius smoothed the parchment contract over the table,
then set his hand by the line for signatures, tapping the pen
thoughtfully on the starting spot.</p>
<p>Harry wrenched his eyes away, up to Lucius Malfoy's face,
forcing himself to breathe regularly, not quite able to stop his
muscles from tensing.</p>
<p>"Our good friend, Severus Snape," said Lucius Malfoy, still
tapping the pen on the line awaiting his signature. "The Defense
Professor, calling himself Quirrell. Now I ask again, who is your
third suspect, Harry Potter?"</p>
<p>"I would strongly advise that you sign first, Lord Malfoy, if
you're going to do so anyway. You will benefit from this
information more if you do not think I am trying to persuade you of
something."</p>
<p>Another humorless smile. "I shall take my chances. Speak, if you
wish this to continue."</p>
<p>Harry hesitated, then said evenly, "My third suspect is Albus
Dumbledore."</p>
<p>The tapping pen stilled on the parchment. "A strange
allegation," Lucius drawled. "Dumbledore lost much face when a
Hogwarts student died within his tenure. Do you suppose that I will
believe anything of him, only because he is my enemy?"</p>
<p>"He is one suspect among several, Lord Malfoy, and not
necessarily the most plausible. But the reason I was able to kill a
full-grown mountain troll was that I had a weapon which Dumbledore
gave to me, at the start of the school year. It's not strong
evidence, but it's suspicious. And if you're thinking that
murdering one of his students is not Dumbledore's style, well, the
same thought had occurred to me."</p>
<p>"It's <em>not</em> his style?" Draco Malfoy said.</p>
<p>Lucius Malfoy shook his head in a measured, careful movement.
"Not quite, my son. Dumbledore is particular in his evils." Lord
Malfoy leaned back into his chair, and then sat quite still. "Tell
me of this weapon."</p>
<p>"I am not yet certain I should go into details about that in
your presence, Lord Malfoy." Harry took a breath. "Let <em>me</em>
be clear on this. I am not trying to sell you on the idea that
Dumbledore is behind this, just raising the possibility -"</p>
<p>Then Draco Malfoy spoke. "The device Dumbledore gave you - was
it something to kill trolls? I mean, <em>just</em> trolls? Can you
tell us that?"</p>
<p>Lucius turned his head to look at his son with some
surprise.</p>
<p>"No..." Harry said slowly. "It wasn't specifically a sword of
anti-troll slaying, or anything like that."</p>
<p>Draco's eyes were intent. "Would the device have worked against
an assassin?"</p>
<p><em>Not if they had shields raised.</em> "No."</p>
<p>"A fight in school?"</p>
<p><em>An expanding rock in the throat is inherently lethal.</em>
"No. I don't think it was meant for use against humans."</p>
<p>Draco nodded. "So just magical creatures. Would it have been a
good weapon against an angry Hippogriff, or something like
that?"</p>
<p>"Does the Stunning Hex work on Hippogriffs?" Harry said
slowly.</p>
<p>"I don't know," said Draco.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Lucius Malfoy.</p>
<p><em>Compared to trying to target a Wingardium Leviosa and Finite
Incantatem -</em> "Then a Stunning Hex would be a better way of
dealing with a Hippogriff." Put that way, it did seem increasingly
like a Transfigured rock was an optimal weapon <em>only</em>
against a flesh-and-blood magical creature with spell-resistant
skin. "But... I mean, it might not have <em>been</em> intended as a
weapon at all, I used it in a strange way, it could have just been
a crazy whim -"</p>
<p>"No," Lucius Malfoy said lowly. "<em>Not</em> a whim. Not
coincidence. Not Dumbledore."</p>
<p>"Then it's him," Draco said. Slowly Draco's eyes narrowed, and
he gave a vicious nod. "It's been him <em>since the beginning.</em>
The court Legilimens <em>said</em> that someone had used
Legilimency on Granger. Dumbledore <em>admitted</em> that it was
him. And I bet the wards <em>did</em> go off when Granger cursed me
and Dumbledore just <em>ignored</em> them."</p>
<p>"But -" Harry said. He looked at Lucius, wondering if it was
really to his advantage to question this idea. "What would be his
<em>motive?</em> Are we going to say he's evil and leave it at
that?"</p>
<p>Draco Malfoy jumped out of his chair and began pacing around the
room, black robes swishing behind the young boy, the goblin guards
staring at him in some surprise through their enchanted goggles.
"To figure out a strange plot, look at what happens, then ask who
benefits. Except that Dumbledore didn't plan on you trying to save
Granger at her trial, he tried to stop you from doing that. What
would've happened if Granger <em>had</em> gone to Azkaban? House
Malfoy and House Potter would've hated each other forever. Of all
the suspects, the only one who wants <em>that</em> is Dumbledore.
So it fits. It <em>all</em> fits. The one who really committed the
murder is - Albus Dumbledore!"</p>
<p>"Um," Harry said. "But why give <em>me</em> an anti-troll
weapon? I said it was suspicious, I didn't say that it made any
sense."</p>
<p>Draco nodded thoughtfully. "Maybe Dumbledore thought you'd stop
the troll before it got Granger and then he could blame Father for
sending it. A lot of people would be very angry if they thought
Father had even <em>tried</em> to do something like that, in
Hogwarts. Like Father said, Dumbledore must've lost face when
people found out that a student had actually died in Hogwarts,
being safe is what Hogwarts is famous for. So that part probably
wasn't supposed to happen."</p>
<p>Harry's mind involuntarily flashed back to the horror in
Dumbledore's eyes when he'd seen Hermione Granger's body.</p>
<p><em>Would I have gotten there in time, if the Weasley twins
hadn't had their magic map stolen? Could that have been the plan?
And then, though Dumbledore didn't know it, somebody stole their
map, and I was too late... but no, that doesn't make much sense, I
found out too late, how could Dumbledore have guessed that I'd use
a broomstick... well, he did know I had one...</em></p>
<p>There was no way a plan like that could work.</p>
<p>And it hadn't.</p>
<p>But someone going a little bit senile might <em>expect</em> it
to work, and a phoenix might not know the difference.</p>
<p>"Or," Draco Malfoy continued, still pacing energetically, "maybe
Dumbledore had an enchanted troll around, and he expected you to
defeat it some other time, for some other plot, and then he used
the troll on Granger instead. I can't imagine Dumbledore had this
<em>all</em> planned since the first week of lessons -"</p>
<p>"I can imagine," Lucius Malfoy said in low tones. "I have seen
such, from Dumbledore."</p>
<p>Draco nodded decisively. "Then I was never <em>supposed</em> to
die in the first plot. Dumbledore knew Professor Quirrell was
checking on me, or Dumbledore planned to have someone else find me
in time - I couldn't have testified against Granger if I was dead,
and he'd have lost face if I'd died. But my leaving Hogwarts and
not being around to lead Slytherin would be just right for him. And
then the next time Harry was supposed to stop the troll before it
got Granger and everyone was supposed to blame you, Father, only
that time it didn't go the way Dumbledore planned."</p>
<p>Lucius Malfoy lifted his grey eyes, from where he'd been gazing
with open surprise at his son. "If this is true - but I wonder if
Harry Potter is only playing at being reluctant to believe it."</p>
<p>"Maybe," Draco said. "But I'm pretty sure he isn't."</p>
<p>"Then, if it is true..." Lucius Malfoy's voice trailed off. A
slow fury was lighting in his eyes.</p>
<p>"What <em>would</em> we do, exactly?" Harry said.</p>
<p>"That, too, is clear to me," Draco said. He whirled on them and
raised a finger high in the air. "We shall find the proof to
convict Dumbledore of this crime, and bring him to justice!"</p>
<p>Harry Potter and Lucius Malfoy looked at each other.</p>
<p>Neither of them quite knew what to say.</p>
<p>"My son," Lucius Malfoy said after a time, "truly, you have done
very well this day."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Father!"</p>
<p>"However, this is not a play, we are not Aurors, and we do not
put our trust in trials."</p>
<p>Some of the light went out of Draco's eyes. "Oh."</p>
<p>"I, ah, do have a sentimental fondness for trials," Harry
interjected. <em>I cannot believe I am having this
conversation.</em> He needed to go home and take a sheet of paper
and a pencil and try to figure out whether Draco's reasoning
<em>actually</em> made sense. "And evidence."</p>
<p>Lucius Malfoy turned his gaze to Harry Potter then, and his eyes
simmered in pure grey fury.</p>
<p>"If you have deceived me," Lucius Malfoy said in tones of low
anger, "if all this is a lie, then I will not forgive. But if this
is not deception... Bring me the proof to convict Dumbledore of
this murder before the Wizengamot, or evidence enough to have him
cast down, and there is nothing that House Malfoy will not do for
you, Harry Potter. Nothing."</p>
<p>Harry took a deep breath. He needed to sort all this out and
figure out the actual probabilities, but he didn't have
<em>time</em>. "If it <em>is</em> Dumbledore, then removing him
from the gameboard leaves a huge hole in Britain's power
structure."</p>
<p>"So it does," Lucius Malfoy said with a grim smile. "Did you
have ambitions of filling it yourself, Harry Potter?"</p>
<p>"Some of your opposition might not like that. They could
fight."</p>
<p>"They will lose," Lucius Malfoy said, now with a face hard like
iron.</p>
<p>"So this is what I'd want House Malfoy to do for me, Lord
Malfoy, if Dumbledore gets removed because of me. When the
opposition is most frightened - that's when they'll be offered a
last-minute arrangement to avoid a civil war. Some of your allies
might not prefer it, but there'll be a lot of neutrals who'll be
glad to see stability. The bargain will be that instead of you
taking over right away, Draco Malfoy will take power when he comes
of age."</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " Draco said.</p>
<p>"Draco has testified under Veritaserum that he tried to help
Hermione Granger. I bet there'd be a lot of people in the
opposition who'd take a chance on him rather than fight. I'm not
sure how exactly you'd enforce it - Unbreakable Vows or Gringotts
contracts or what - but there'll be some sort of enforceable
compact about power going to Draco after he graduates Hogwarts.
I'll throw any support the Boy-Who-Lived has behind that bargain.
Try to persuade Longbottom and Bones and so on. Our first plan
paves the way for that later, if you're careful to act honorable
when you deal with Longbottom and Bones this time around."</p>
<p>"Father, I <em>swear</em> I didn't -"</p>
<p>Lucius's face twisted into a grim smile. "I know you didn't,
son. Well." The white-haired man stared across the mighty golden
table at Harry Potter. "Those terms are acceptable to me. But fail
in any part of our agreement, whether our first bargain, or the
second, and there shall be consequences for you, Harry Potter.
Clever words will not halt that."</p>
<p>And Lucius Malfoy signed the parchment.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Mad-Eye Moody had been staring at the bronze door of the
Gringotts meeting room for what seemed like hours, insofar as a man
could stare at any one thing when his gaze always saw in all
directions.</p>
<p>The trouble with trying to be suspicious of a man like Lucius
Malfoy, Moody thought, was that you could spend an entire day
thinking of everything he might be up to, and still not have
finished.</p>
<p>The door cracked open and Harry Potter trudged out, small beads
of sweat still on his forehead.</p>
<p>"Did you sign anything?" Mad-Eye demanded upon the instant.</p>
<p>Harry Potter looked at him silently, then reached into his robes
and drew out a folded parchment. "The goblins are already executing
this," said Harry Potter. "They made three copies before I
left."</p>
<p>"MERLIN DAMN IT SON -" Moody paused as his Eye caught sight of
the second half of the document as Harry Potter slowly, as though
reluctantly, began to unfold the top upward. A glance sufficed to
take in the paragraphs drawn in careful handwriting, Lucius
Malfoy's elegant signature below Harry Potter's. And then Moody
exploded, even as the top half of the document also began to enter
his Sight. "You <em>exonerate House Malfoy</em> of <em>any
involvement in Hermione Granger's death?</em> Do you have any idea
what you've done, you little fool? Why in Merlin's name would you
do something like WHAT -"</p>

<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 98: Roles, Final<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p><em>Sunday, April 19th, 6:34pm.</em></p>
<p>Daphne Greengrass walked quietly toward the Greengrass room
below the Slytherin dungeons, the privilege of an Ancient House; on
her way to drop off her trunk from the Hogwarts Express, before she
joined the other students for dinner. The whole private area had
been hers alone ever since Malfoy had gone. Her hand, held behind
her, made repeated come-along gestures at her huge emerald-studded
trunk, which seemed hesitant to follow. Maybe the enchantments on
the sturdy old family device needed to be reapplied; or maybe her
trunk was reluctant to follow her into Hogwarts, which was no
longer safe.</p>
<p>There'd been a long talk between Mother and Father, after they'd
been told about Hermione; with Daphne hiding around a doorway to
listen, choking back her tears and trying not to make sounds.</p>
<p>Mother had said that the sad fact was that if only one student
died every year, well, that still made Hogwarts safer than
Beauxbatons, let alone Durmstrang. There were more ways for a young
witch to die than being murdered. Beauxbatons's Transfiguration
Master just wasn't on the same level as McGonagall, Mother had
said.</p>
<p>Father had soberly remarked how important it was for the
Greengrass heir to stay at Hogwarts where all the other Noble
families sent their children to school (it was the reason for the
old tradition of the Noble families synchronizing the birth of
their heirs, to put them in the same year of Hogwarts, if they
could). And Father had said that being heiress to a Most Ancient
House meant you couldn't always stay away from trouble.</p>
<p>She could have done without hearing that last part.</p>
<p>Daphne gulped hard, as she turned the doorknob, and opened the
door.</p>
<p>"Miss Greengrass -" whispered a shadowy, silvery-robed
figure.</p>
<p>Daphne screamed and slammed the door and drew her wand and
turned to run.</p>
<p>"Wait!" cried the voice, now higher and louder.</p>
<p>Daphne paused. That couldn't <em>possibly</em> be who it had
sounded like.</p>
<p>Slowly, Daphne turned, and opened the door again.</p>
<p><em>"You!"</em> Daphne said in astonishment, as she saw the face
beneath the hood. "I thought you were -"</p>
<p>"I come back to you now," the silvery-robed figure said in a
strong voice, "at the turn of the -"</p>
<p>"<em>What are you doing in my bedroom?</em> " shrieked
Daphne.</p>
<p>"I heard you can cast the mist form of the Patronus Charm. Can I
see?"</p>
<p>Daphne stared, and then her blood began to burn. "Why?" she
said, keeping her wand level. "So you can <em>kill</em> everyone in
Slytherin who casts un-Slytherin spells? We all <em>know</em> who
it was had Hermione killed!"</p>
<p>The figure's voice rose. "I testified under Veritaserum that I
tried to help Miss Granger! I really was trying to help her, when I
grabbed her hand on the roof, when I helped her off the floor
-"</p>
<p>Daphne kept her wand level. "Like your father couldn't tamper
with the Aurors' record, if he wanted to! I wasn't born yesterday,
Mister <em>Malfoy!</em> "</p>
<p>Slowly, as if not to cause alarm, the silver-robed figure drew a
wand from his robes. Daphne's hand tightened on her own wand, but
then she recognized the position of the fingers on the wand, the
stance the figure was assuming, and she drew a shocked breath -</p>
<p><em>"Expecto Patronum!</em> "</p>
<p>Silver light leapt from the end of the other's wand - and
condensed, forming a shining serpent that seemed to coil in the air
as though nesting there.</p>
<p>She just gaped.</p>
<p>"I <em>did</em> try to help Hermione Granger," Draco Malfoy said
with a level voice. "Because I know the sickness at the heart of
Slytherin's House, the reason why so many of us can't cast the
Patronus Charm any more, is hate. Hate of Muggleborns, or just
anyone really. People think that's all Slytherin is about now, not
cunning or ambition or honorable nobility. And I even know, because
it's obvious if you just look, that Hermione Granger wasn't weak at
magic."</p>
<p>Daphne's mind had gone completely blank. Her eyes darted around
nervously, just to check that there wasn't blood coming from under
the doors, like the last time Something had Broken.</p>
<p>"And I've also figured out," Draco Malfoy said quietly, as the
silver snake went on shining with unmistakeable light and warmth,
"that Hermione Granger never really tried to kill me. Maybe she was
False-Memory-Charmed, maybe she was Legilimized, but now that she's
been murdered, it's obvious that Miss Granger was the target in the
first place, when somebody tried to set her up for murdering me
-"</p>
<p>"D-do-do you know what you're <em>saying?</em> " Daphne's voice
broke. If Lucius Malfoy heard his heir saying that - he'd
<em>skin</em> Draco and turn him into <em>trousers!</em></p>
<p>Draco Malfoy smiled, metallic robes gleaming in the light of his
full corporeal Patronus; it was a smile both arrogant and
dangerous, like being turned into a pair of leather pants was
beneath his concerns. "Yes," said Draco, "but it doesn't matter
now. House Malfoy is returning House Potter's money and cancelling
the debt."</p>
<p>Daphne walked over to her bed and then fell on it, hoping she
could wake up from the dream once she was in bed.</p>
<p>"I'd like you to join a conspiracy," said the figure in the
shining robes. "Everyone in Slytherin who can cast the Patronus
Charm, and everyone who can learn. That's how we'll know to trust
each other, when the Silvery Slytherins meet." With a dramatic
gesture, Draco Malfoy cast back his hood. "But it won't work
without <em>you,</em> Daphne Greengrass. You and your family. Your
mother will negotiate it with Father, but I'd like the Greengrasses
to hear the proposal from you, first." Draco Malfoy's voice lowered
grimly. "There is much we must speak of, before we eat dinner."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry Potter had, apparently, taken to being invisible; they'd
glimpsed his hand only briefly, when he was handing them the list,
written on strange not-parchment. Harry had explained that, all
things considered, he didn't really think it was smart for him to
be <em>findable</em> except on special occasions, so he was just
going to deal with people as a disembodied floating voice from now
on, or as a brilliant silver light that hid behind corners where
nobody could see it, and which could always find his friends no
matter where they tried to hide. It was, in all honesty, one of the
creepiest things which Fred and George had ever heard, over a
lifetime which had included filling the shoes of every student in
second-year Slytherin with Transfigured live millipedes. Fred and
George didn't think this could possibly be good for anyone's
sanity, but they didn't know what to say. It couldn't be denied,
they'd seen with their own four eyes, that Hogwarts...</p>
<p>...wasn't safe...</p>
<p>"I don't know who you went to for the False Memory Charm on Rita
Skeeter," said the sourceless voice of Harry Potter. "Whoever it
is... probably <em>won't</em> be able to fill this order directly,
but they may know someone who can get things from the Muggle world.
And - I know it may cost extra, but as few people as possible
should know that Harry Potter is related to this." Another flash of
a small boy's hand, and a bag hit the ground with the clinking
noise. "Some of these items are expensive even in the Muggle world,
and your contact may have to go outside Britain; but one hundred
Galleons will be enough to pay for it all, I hope. I'd tell you
where the Galleons came from, but I don't want to spoil tomorrow's
surprise."</p>
<p>"What <em>is</em> this stuff?" said Fred or George, as they
looked over the list. "Our father is a Muggle expert -"</p>
<p>"- and we don't recognize <em>half</em> this stuff -"</p>
<p>"- why, we don't recognize any of it -"</p>
<p>"- just what are you planning to <em>do?</em> "</p>
<p>"Things have become serious," Harry's voice said softly. "I
don't know what I'll have to do. I may need the power of the
Muggles, not just the wizards, before this is done - and I might
need it right away, with no time to prepare. I'm not
<em>planning</em> to use any of this. I just want it around in case
of... contingencies." Harry's voice paused. "Obviously I owe you
more than I can ever repay and you won't <em>let</em> me give you
<em>any</em> of what you deserve, I don't even know how to say
thank you properly, and all I can do is hope that someday when you
grow up you'll be more sensible about this whole thing and would
you <em>please</em> take a ten percent commission -"</p>
<p>"Shut up, you," said George or Fred.</p>
<p>"For God's sake, you went after a troll for me and Fred had his
ribs broken!"</p>
<p>They both just shook their heads. Harry had stayed behind when
they'd told him to run, and stepped forward to distract the troll
from eating George. Harry was the kind of person, they knew, who'd
think that something like that didn't cancel out what he owed the
Weasley twins, that his own deed wasn't properly commensurate. But
what the Weasleys knew, and Harry wouldn't understand until he was
older, was that it meant that nothing was owed, or ever could be
owed between them. It was a strange kind of selfishness, they
thought, that Harry could understand kindness within himself -
never dreaming of asking of money from anyone he'd helped more than
they'd helped him, or calling that a debt - while being apparently
unable to conceive that others might want to act the same way
toward <em>him</em>.</p>
<p>"Remind me to buy you a copy of the Muggle novel <em>Atlas
Shrugged,</em>" the sourceless voice said. "I'm starting to
understand what sort of person can benefit from reading it."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Monday, April 20th, 7:00pm.</em></p>
<p>It happened without any intervention or sign from the Head
Table, as the students had finished their subdued dinner; it
happened with no permission or forgiveness asked from the
Professors or the Headmaster.</p>
<p>Shortly after the dessert dishes had appeared, a student stood
up from the Slytherin Table and calmly made his way, not to the
front of the Head Table, but toward the opposite side of the Four
Tables of Hogwarts. A few whispers broke out at the sight of the
white-blonde short-cropped hair, as Draco Malfoy stood there,
silently regarding all of Hogwarts. Draco Malfoy had said almost
nothing since his surprise return. The Slytherin had condescended
neither to confirm nor deny that he had returned because, with
Hermione Granger dead at his family's hand, he no longer had
anything to fear.</p>
<p>Then Draco Malfoy took up a spoon in one hand, and a glass of
water in the other, and began tapping, producing a clear ringing
sound.</p>
<p><em>Ting.</em></p>
<p><em>Ting.</em></p>
<p><em>Ting.</em></p>
<p>It produced more excited babble at first. At the Head Table, the
various Professors looked in puzzlement toward the Headmaster in
his great chair, but the Headmaster gave no sign, and so the
faculty did nothing.</p>
<p>Draco Malfoy continued tapping the spoon upon his glass, until
the room fell silent, waiting.</p>
<p>Then another student arose from the Ravenclaw table, and made
his way to where Draco Malfoy was standing, turning to face
Hogwarts at his side. Breaths were drawn in surprise; those two
should have been the bitterest of enemies -</p>
<p>"I, and my Father, the Lord of the Noble and Most Ancient House
of Malfoy," Draco Malfoy said in a clear voice, "have come to
realize that there are ill forces at work in Hogwarts. That these
ill forces, did wish Hermione Granger harm. That Hermione Granger
was perhaps compelled, against her will, to raise her hand against
our House; or perhaps she and I were both Memory-Charmed. We now
say that whoever dared use the heir of Malfoy so, is the enemy of
House Malfoy, upon whom we shall have our vengeance. And that honor
be served, we have returned all moneys taken from House Potter, and
canceled all debt."</p>
<p>Then Harry Potter spoke. "House Potter acknowledges that it was
an honest mistake, and holds House Malfoy no ill will. We believe
and publicly say that House Malfoy was not at fault in Hermione
Granger's death. Whoever harmed Hermione Granger is the enemy of
House Potter, upon whom we shall have our vengeance. Both of
us."</p>
<p>Then Harry Potter began to walk back to the Ravenclaw table, and
the babble of sheer, utter, reality-crashing bewilderment began to
explode -</p>
<p>Draco Malfoy resumed tapping his spoon against his waterglass,
creating a clear ringing chime.</p>
<p><em>Ting.</em></p>
<p><em>Ting.</em></p>
<p><em>Ting.</em></p>
<p>And other students arose, from other tables, making their way to
where Draco Malfoy stood, arranging themselves at his side, or
behind him, or before him.</p>
<p>There was a dread silence in the Great Hall, a sense of the
world shifting, of realigning Powers, almost tangible in the
air.</p>
<p>"My father, Owen Greengrass, with the consent and full backing
of my mother, the Lady of the Noble and Most Ancient House of
Greengrass," Daphne Greengrass spoke.</p>
<p>"And my forefather, Charles, of the House of Nott," said the
former Lieutenant Nott, once Theodore of Chaos, now standing behind
Draco Malfoy.</p>
<p>"And my grand-aunt, Amelia, of the House of Bones, also Director
of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement," said Susan Bones,
who stood anext Daphne Greengrass, beside whom she had fought.</p>
<p>"And my grandmother, Augusta, of the Noble and Most Ancient
House of Longbottom," said Neville Longbottom, who had returned for
this one night.</p>
<p>"And my father, Lucius, the Lord Malfoy, of the Noble and Most
Ancient House of Malfoy!"</p>
<p>"Together with Alanna Howe constituting a majority of the
Hogwarts Board of Governors!" Daphne Greengrass said clearly.
"Have, to ensure the safety of all students, including their own
children, passed the following Educational Decrees upon the
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>"First!" Daphne said. Daphne was trying to keep her trembling
under control, as she faced the Four Houses at the forefront of the
five. There was only so far her parents' lessons in speech-making
could take her. Daphne's eyes darted down quickly to her hand, upon
which, written with a quill in faint red ink, cues to her lines had
been written. "Students are not to go anywhere alone, not even to
the toilets! You will travel in groups of at least three, and every
group must have a sixth-year or seventh-year student!"</p>
<p>"Second!" Susan Bones said from behind her, voice almost firm.
"To further ensure the students' safety, nine Aurors have been
dispatched to Hogwarts to form an Auxiliary Protective Force!"
Susan took a small, round glass object from within her robes, one
of the communicators that the DMLE used, which they'd all been
given. Susan raised it to her mouth and said, her voice now higher,
"Auror Brodski, this is Susan Bones. <em>Enter!</em> "</p>
<p>The doors to the Hall slammed open, and in marched nine Aurors
in the reinforced leather gear they used when on duty. At once they
spread out, two Aurors taking up station by each of the four
tables, and the last took up watch at the Head Table. There were
more gasps.</p>
<p>"Third!" said Draco Malfoy, his voice commanding. Malfoy had
apparently memorized his own lines, since there was nothing written
on his hand that Daphne could see. "In the face of a common enemy
who does not balk at killing students from any House, the four
Houses of Hogwarts must come together and act as one! To emphasize
this, the House Points system is temporarily suspended!
<em>All</em> Professors will encourage solidarity between Houses,
by decree of the Hogwarts Board of Governors!"</p>
<p>"Fourth!" recited Neville Longbottom. "All students not already
in the Defense Professor's after-school classes, will receive
special training in self-defense by Auror instructors!"</p>
<p>"Fifth!" Theodore Nott yelled in a menacing tone. "All fighting
in the corridors or anywhere outside of Defense lessons will be
dealt with severely! Fight together or don't fight at all!"</p>
<p>"Sixth!" said Daphne Greengrass, and took a deep breath. When
she'd found out what was planned, she'd made her own little extra
request to Mother through the Floo. Even with Lucius Malfoy going
along with Amelia Bones - a thought her mind was still having
trouble grasping - the Greengrass swing vote had still been vital,
since Jugson and his own faction had refused to back Malfoy. Not to
mention that Bones didn't trust Malfoy, and Malfoy didn't trust
Bones. So Mother had demanded, and the Greengrasses had received -
"Since Memory Charms have been used on students without setting off
wards, it is possible that someone on the Hogwarts faculty may be
implicated. Therefore! The Auxiliary Protective force reports
directly to my father, Lord Greengrass!" And this part was only
symbolic, she knew, there'd be no reason anyone wouldn't just
contact the Aurors directly; but it might turn into more, someday,
which was why she'd asked Mother to demand it - "And if anyone
wants to report something to the Auxiliary Protectors, they can
talk to the Aurors, or go through <em>me</em> -" Daphne's arm swept
behind her to indicate the gathered students. "The duly appointed
President of the Auxiliary Protective Special Committee!"</p>
<p>And Daphne paused dramatically. They'd all rehearsed this
part.</p>
<p>"We don't know who the enemy is," said Neville, whose voice did
not squeak.</p>
<p>"We don't know what the enemy wants," said Theodore, still
looking menacing.</p>
<p>"But we know who the enemy is attacking," said Susan, as fierce
as when she'd taken on three seventh-year students.</p>
<p>"The enemy is attacking Hogwarts students," said Draco Malfoy,
clear and commanding, like all this was his natural element.</p>
<p>"And Hogwarts," spoke Daphne of Greengrass, feeling her blood
burn like it never had before in her life, "is going to <em>fight
back."</em></p>

<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>The fourth meeting:<br>
(4:38pm, April 17th, 1992)</em></p>
<p>The man wearing the worn, warm coat, with three faint scars
etched forever into his cheek, observed Harry Potter as closely as
he could while the boy looked around politely at the rows of
cottages. For someone whose best friend had died yesterday, Harry
Potter seemed strangely composed, though not in any way reminiscent
of unfeelingness, or normality. <em>I don't wish to talk about
that,</em> the boy had said, <em>with you or anyone.</em> Saying
'wish' and not 'want', as though to emphasize that he was able to
use grownup words and make grownup decisions. There had been only
one thing Remus Lupin had thought of that might help, after he'd
received the owls from Professor McGonagall and that strange man
Quirinus Quirrell.</p>
<p>"There's a lot of empty houses," the boy said, glancing around
again.</p>
<p>Godric's Hollow had changed, in the decade since Remus Lupin had
been a frequent visitor. Many of the old, peaked cottages looked
deserted, with green leafy vines growing across their windows and
their doors. Britain had contracted noticeably, in the aftermath of
the Wizarding War, having lost not only the dead but the fled.
Godric's Hollow had been hard-hit. And afterward still more
families had moved elsewhere, to Hogsmeade or magical London, the
deserted houses too uncomfortable a reminder.</p>
<p>Others had remained. Godric's Hollow was older than Hogwarts,
older than Godric Gryffindor whose name it had taken, and there
were families which would reside here until the end of the world
and its magic.</p>
<p>The Potters had been one such family, and would be again, if the
last Potter so chose.</p>
<p>Remus Lupin tried to explain all that, simplifying it as best he
could for the young boy. The Ravenclaw nodded thoughtfully and said
nothing, as though he had understood it all without need of
questions. Perhaps that was so; the child of James Potter and Lily
Evans, the Head Boy and Head Girl of Hogwarts, would hardly be
stupid. The child had certainly seemed highly intelligent, for the
little time that they had spoken in January, though at that time
Remus had done most of the talking.</p>
<p>(There was also that business with the Wizengamot which Remus
had heard rumors about, but Remus didn't believe a single word of
that, any more than he'd believed it about James betrothing his son
to Molly's youngest.)</p>
<p>"There's the monument," Remus said, pointing ahead of them.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry walked beside Mr. Lupin toward the black marble obelisk,
thinking silently. It seemed to Harry that this adventure was
essentially misguided; he had no use for grief counseling, that was
not Harry's chosen path. So far as Harry was concerned, the five
stages of grief were Rage, Remorse, Resolve, Research, and
Resurrection. (Not that the usual 'five stages of grief' had any
experimental evidence whatsoever that Harry had ever heard about.)
But Mr. Lupin had seemed too sincere to refuse; and visiting James
and Lily's home was something Harry felt he ought not to turn down.
So Harry walked, feeling oddly detached; walking silently through a
play whose script he was not interested in reading.</p>
<p>Harry had been told that he wasn't to wear the Cloak of
Invisibility for this journey, so that Mr. Lupin could keep track
of him.</p>
<p>Harry was morally certain that Dumbledore, or both Dumbledore
and Mad-Eye Moody, were following them invisibly to see if anyone
tried for the bait. There was no way Harry would have been let out
of Hogwarts with only Remus Lupin for a guard. Harry didn't expect
anything to happen, though. He'd seen nothing to contradict the
hypothesis that all the danger centered on Hogwarts and only
Hogwarts.</p>
<p>As the two of them walked closer toward the center of town, the
marble obelisk transformed into -</p>
<p>Harry drew in a breath. He'd been expecting a heroic pose of
James Potter with wand leveled against Lord Voldemort, and Lily
Potter with arms outstretched in front of the crib.</p>
<p>Instead there was a man with untidy hair and glasses, and a
woman with her hair let down and a baby in her arms, and that was
all.</p>
<p>"It looks very... normal," Harry said, feeling an odd catch in
his throat.</p>
<p>"Madam Longbottom and Professor Dumbledore put their foot down
hard," said Mr. Lupin, who was looking more at Harry than at the
monument. "They said that the Potters should be remembered as they
had lived, not as they had died."</p>
<p>Harry looked at the statue, thinking. Very strange, to see
himself as a baby of stone, with no scar upon his forehead. It was
a glimpse at an alternate universe, one where Harry James Potter
(no Evans-Verres to his name) became an intelligent but ordinary
wizarding scholar, maybe Sorted into Gryffindor like his parents. A
Harry Potter who grew up a proper young wizard, knowing little of
science for all that his mother was Muggleborn. Ultimately
changing... not much. James and Lily wouldn't have raised their son
with what Professor Quirrell would have called <em>ambition</em>
and what Professor Verres-Evans would have called <em>the common
endeavor.</em> His birth parents would have loved him very much,
and that would not have been much help to anyone in the world
except Harry. If someone had undone their death -</p>
<p>"You were their friend," Harry said, turning to look at Lupin.
"For a long time, since you were children."</p>
<p>Mr. Lupin nodded silently.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's voice resounded in Harry's approximate
memory: <em>The most likely difference is not that you care more.
Rather it is that, being a more logical creature than they, only
you are aware that the role of Friend ought to require this of
you...</em></p>
<p>"When Lily and James died," Harry said, "did you think at all of
whether there might be some magical way to get them back? Like
Orpheus and Eurydice? Or the, what was it, Elrin brothers?"</p>
<p>"There is no magic which can undo death," Mr. Lupin said
quietly. "There are some mysteries which wizardry cannot
touch."</p>
<p>"Did you do a mental check of what you thought you knew, how you
thought you knew it, and how high the probability was of that
conclusion?"</p>
<p>"What?" said Mr. Lupin. "Could you repeat that, Harry?"</p>
<p>"I'm saying, did you think about it anyway?"</p>
<p>Mr. Lupin shook his head.</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"Because it was already done, and over," Remus Lupin said
gently. "Because wherever James and Lily are now, they would wish
me to act for the sake of the living, not the dead."</p>
<p>Harry nodded silently. He'd been pretty sure of the answer to
that question before he'd asked. He'd already read that script. But
he'd asked anyway, just in case Mr. Lupin had spent a week
obsessing about it, because Harry could have been wrong.</p>
<p>The soft voice of the Defense Professor seemed to speak in
Harry's mind. <em>Surely, if Lupin truly cared, he would not need
special instruction for something as simple as thinking for five
minutes before giving up...</em></p>
<p><em>Yes, he would,</em> Harry answered the mental voice.
<em>Human beings wouldn't suddenly obtain a skill like that just
because they cared. I learned about it because I'd read library
books, produced by a huge scientific edifice -</em></p>
<p>And that other part of Harry said, in that soft voice, <em>But
there is also another hypothesis, Mr. Potter, and it fits the data
in a much less complicated way.</em></p>
<p><em>No it doesn't! How would people even know what to pretend,
if nobody had ever cared?</em></p>
<p><em>They don't know. That is what you observe.</em></p>
<p>The two of them walked onward toward a certain house, past a
long row of occupied wizard cottages and other cottages overgrown
with vines.</p>
<p>Coming finally to the house with half its top blown off, and
green leaves growing over into the inside; behind a shoulder-high
wild-growing hedge lining the sidewalk, and a narrow metal gate
(Mr. Hagrid had probably stepped right over it, being unable to fit
through). The gap in the roof was like a giant mouth had taken a
circular bite from the house, leaving spines of wood, what had
maybe been support beams, sticking out. To the right side a single
chimney still stood upright, uneaten by the giant bite, but leaning
dangerously without its former support. Windows were shattered.
Where there should have been a front door were only splinters of
wood.</p>
<p>To this place Lord Voldemort had come, <em>silently, making less
noise than the dead leaves slithering along the
pavement...</em></p>
<p>Remus Lupin put a hand upon Harry's shoulder. "Touch the gate,"
Mr. Lupin urged.</p>
<p>Harry reached out a hand and did so.</p>
<p>Like a fast-growing flower a sign burst from the tangled weeds
in the ground behind the gate, a wooden sign with golden letters,
and it said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">On this spot, on the night of 31
October 1981,<br>
Lily and James Potter lost their lives.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">They were survived by their son,
Harry Potter,<br>
the only wizard ever to withstand the Killing Curse,<br>
the Boy-Who-Lived, who broke You-Know-Who's power.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">This house has been left in its
ruined state,<br>
as a monument to the Potters,<br>
as a reminder of their sacrifice.</p>
<p>In a blank space below the golden letters were written other
messages, dozens of them, magical ink that rose to the surface and
gleamed brightly enough to be read before fading and giving way to
other messages.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">So my Gideon is avenged.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Thank you, Harry Potter. Fare well
wherever you are.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">We will always be in the Potters'
debt.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Oh James, oh Lily, I am sorry.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I hope you're alive, Harry
Potter.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">There is always a price.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I wish our last words had been
kinder, James. I'm sorry.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">There is always a dawn after the
night.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Rest well, Lily.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Bless you, Boy-Who-Lived. You were
our miracle.</p>
<p>"I guess -" Harry said. "I guess that's what people do - instead
of trying to make it better -" Harry stopped. The thought seemed
unworthy of this place. He looked up, and saw Remus Lupin gazing at
him with a look so gentle that Harry wrenched his eyes away to the
blasted and broken roof.</p>
<p><em>You were our miracle.</em> Harry had always heard the word
'miracle' in the context of how, in the natural universe, there was
no such thing. And yet looking at the ruined house, he suddenly
knew exactly what the word meant, the note of grace all
unexplained, the blessing inexplicable. The Dark Lord had almost
won, and then in one night all the darkness and terror had ended,
salvation without justification, a sudden dawn from out of the
darkness and even now nobody knew <em>why</em> -</p>
<p>If Lily Potter had lived beyond her confrontation with Lord
Voldemort, she would have felt that way when she saw her baby
alive, afterward.</p>
<p>"Let's go," whispered the baby boy, ten years later.</p>
<p>They went.</p>
<p>The graveyard's entrance was guarded by a lockless gate of the
sort that kept out animals, with a place to stand while you moved
the door from one side of the standing-place to the other. Remus
took out his wand (Harry was already holding his) and there was a
brief blur as they stepped through.</p>
<p>Some of the stones rising up from the ground looked as old as
the wall in Oxford that his father had said was around a thousand
years old.</p>
<p><em>Hallie Fleming,</em> said the first stone that Harry saw, in
a carving almost invisibly faded with the erosion of time.
<em>Vienna Wood,</em> said another.</p>
<p>It had been a long time since Harry had visited a graveyard. His
mind had still been childlike the last time he'd come to one, long
before he'd seen within Death's shadow. Coming here now was...
strange, and sad, and puzzling, and <em>this has been happening for
so long, why haven't wizards tried to stop it, why aren't they
putting all their strength into that like Muggles do with medical
research, only more so, wizards have more reason to
hope...</em></p>
<p>"The Dumbledores lived in Godric's Hollow too?" Harry said, as
they walked past a pair of relatively new stones saying <em>Kendra
Dumbledore</em> and <em>Ariana Dumbledore.</em></p>
<p>"For a long, long time," Mr. Lupin said.</p>
<p>They walked further into the graveyard, far toward the end, past
many deaths that had been mourned.</p>
<p>Then Mr. Lupin pointed at a linked double headstone, of marble
still white and unaged.</p>
<p>"Are there going to be messages there?" Harry said. He didn't
want to deal any more with the way that other people dealt with
death.</p>
<p>Mr. Lupin shook his head.</p>
<p>They walked toward the linked white stones.</p>
<p>And stood before -</p>
<p>"What is this?" Harry whispered. "Who... <em>who wrote
this?</em> "</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">JAMES POTTER<br>
BORN 27 MARCH 1960<br>
DIED 31 OCTOBER 1981</p>
<p>"Wrote what?" said Mr. Lupin, puzzled.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">LILY POTTER<br>
BORN 30 JANUARY 1960<br>
DIED 31 OCTOBER 1981</p>
<p>"<em>This!</em> " Harry cried. "The <em>inscription!</em> "
There were tears welling up in Harry's eyes, at the brightness out
of place and unexplained, the touch of grace where no grace should
have been, the mysterious blessing, tears welling up at</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">THE LAST ENEMY THAT SHALL BE
DESTROYED IS DEATH</p>
<p>"That?" Mr. Lupin said. "That's the... motto, I suppose you
could call it, of the Potters. Though I don't think it was ever
something as formal as that. Just a saying handed down from long,
long ago..."</p>
<p>"This - that -" Harry scrambled down to kneel beside the grave,
touched the inscription with a trembling hand. "<em>How?</em>
Things like that can't just be, be <em>genetic</em> -"</p>
<p>Then Harry saw what tears had blurred, the faint carving of a
line, within a circle, within a triangle.</p>
<p>The symbol of the Deathly Hallows.</p>
<p>And Harry understood.</p>
<p>"They tried," Harry whispered.</p>
<p><em>The three Peverell brothers.</em></p>
<p><em>Had they lost someone precious to them, was that where it
had begun?</em></p>
<p>"With all their lives, they tried, and they made progress -"</p>
<p><em>The Cloak of Invisibility, that could defeat the Dementors'
sight.</em></p>
<p>"- but their research wasn't finished -"</p>
<p><em>Hiding from Death's shadow is not defeating Death itself.
The Resurrection Stone couldn't really bring anyone back. The Elder
Wand couldn't protect you from old age.</em></p>
<p>"- so they passed on the mission to their children, and their
children's children."</p>
<p><em>Generation after generation.</em></p>
<p><em>Until it came to me.</em></p>
<p>Could Time echo like that, rhyming, between this far into the
future, and that far in the past? It <em>couldn't</em> be
coincidence, could it? Not this message, not in this place.</p>
<p><em>My family.</em></p>
<p><em>You really were, my mother and my father.</em></p>
<p>"It doesn't mean resurrecting the dead, Harry," Mr. Lupin said.
"It means accepting death, and so being beyond death, mastering
it."</p>
<p>"Did James tell you that?" Harry said, his voice strange.</p>
<p>"No," said Mr. Lupin, "but -"</p>
<p>"Good."</p>
<p>Harry rose up slowly from where he had been kneeling, feeling as
though he were pushing up a sun upon his shoulders, raising the
dawn above the horizon.<em><br></em></p>
<p><em>Of</em> course <em>other wizards have tried. I am not
unique. I was never alone. These feelings in my heart, they're not
so special, not in the wizard world or the Muggle one.</em></p>
<p>"Harry, your wand!" There was a sudden excitement in Mr. Lupin's
voice, and when Harry raised his wand to look at it closely, he saw
that it was gleaming ever so faintly with a silver light, welling
out of the wood.</p>
<p>"Cast the Patronus Charm!" urged Mr. Lupin. "Try casting it
again, Harry!"</p>
<p><em>Oh, right. So far as Mr. Lupin knows, I can't -</em></p>
<p>Harry smiled, and even laughed a little. "I'd better not," Harry
said. "If I tried to cast the spell in this state of mind, it'd
probably kill me."</p>
<p><em>"What?</em> " said Mr. Lupin. "The Patronus Charm doesn't do
that!"</p>
<p>Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres raised his left hand, still
laughing, and wiped away some more tears.</p>
<p>"You know, Mr. Lupin," Harry said, "it really takes a
<em>baroque</em> interpretation to think that somebody would be
walking around, pondering how death is just something we all have
to accept, and communicate their state of mind by saying, 'The last
enemy that shall be destroyed is death.' Maybe someone else thought
it sounded poetic and picked up the phrase and tried to interpret
it differently, but whoever said it first didn't like death much."
Sometimes it puzzled Harry how most people didn't seem to even
<em>notice</em> when they were twisting something around to the
180-degree opposite of its first obvious reading. It couldn't be a
raw brainpower thing, people could see the obvious reading of most
other English sentences. "Also 'shall be destroyed' refers to a
change of future state, so it can't be about the way things are
now."</p>
<p>Remus Lupin was staring at him with wide eyes. "You certainly
are James and Lily's child," the man said, sounding rather
shocked.</p>
<p>"Yes, I am," Harry said. But that wasn't enough, he had to do
something more, so Harry raised his wand in the air and said, his
voice as steady as he could make it, "I am Harry James
Potter-Evans-Verres, the son of Lily and James, of the house of
Potter, and I accept my family's quest. Death is my enemy, and I
will defeat it."</p>
<p><em>Thrayen beyn Peverlas soona ahnd thrih heera toal thissoom
Dath bey yewoonen.</em></p>
<p>"What?" Harry said aloud. The words had popped up into his
stream of consciousness as though from his own thoughts,
unexplained.</p>
<p>"What was that?" said Remus Lupin at the same time.</p>
<p>Harry turned, scanning the graveyard, but he didn't see
anything. Beside him, Mr. Lupin was doing the same.</p>
<p>Neither of them noticed the tall stone worn as though from a
thousand years of age, upon it a line within a circle within a
triangle glowing ever so faintly silver, like the light which had
shone from Harry's wand, invisible at that distance beneath the
still-bright Sun.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Some time later:</em></p>
<p>"Thank you again, Mr. Lupin," Harry said, the tall, faintly
scarred man was about to depart once more. "Though I really wish
you hadn't -"</p>
<p>"Professor Dumbledore said that I was to portkey us back to
Hogwarts if anything unusual happened, whether or not it seemed
like an attack," Mr. Lupin said firmly. "Which is eminently
sensible."</p>
<p>Harry nodded. And then, having carefully saved this question for
last, "Do you have any idea of what the words meant?"</p>
<p>"If I did, I wouldn't tell you," Mr. Lupin said, looking rather
severe. "Certainly not without Professor Dumbledore's permission. I
can understand your eagerness, but you should not go trying to
uncover any ancestral secrets of the Potters until you are an
adult. That means after you've passed your NEWTs, Harry, or at
least your OWLs. And I still think you've picked up entirely the
wrong idea of what your family motto is meant to say!"</p>
<p>Harry nodded, sighing internally, and bid Mr. Lupin
farewell.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry went back through Hogwarts, to the Ravenclaw Tower,
feeling strange, and strengthened. He would not have expected any
of that, but it had been all to the good.</p>
<p>He was passing through the Ravenclaw common room, on the way to
his dorm.</p>
<p>That was when the shining creature came to him, gleaming soft
white beneath the candlefires of the Ravenclaw common room, as it
slithered out from nowhere, the silver snake.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Þregen béon Pefearles suna and
þrie hira tól þissum Déað béo gewunen.</em></p>

Godric's Hollow.</p>

<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 101: Precautionary Measures, Pt
2<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>Harry stood, panting, in the midst of a brief wasted circle amid
the forest, more destruction than a first-year should have been
able to reach, by himself. The Severing Charm wouldn't bring down a
tree, so he'd started partially Transfiguring cross-sections
through the wood. It hadn't let out what was inside him, bringing
down a small circle of trees hadn't made him feel any better, all
the emotions were still there but while he was destroying trees he
at least wasn't thinking about how the feelings couldn't be let
out.</p>
<p>After Harry had run out of available magic he'd started tearing
off branches with his bare hands and snapping them. His hands were
bleeding, though nothing that Madam Pomfrey couldn't fix in the
morning. Only Dark magic left permanent scars on wizards.</p>
<p>There came a sound of something moving in the woods, like the
hoofbeats of a horse, and Harry whirled, his wand rising once more;
some part of his magic had returned while he was working with his
hands. It occurred to him for the first time that he was out in the
Forbidden Forest alone, and making noise.</p>
<p>What emerged into the moonlight was not the unicorn Harry had
expected, but a creature with a lower body like that of a horse,
gleaming white-brown beneath the moonlight, and the bare upper
chest of a male human with long white hair. The moonlight caught
the centaur's face, and Harry saw that the eyes were almost as blue
as Dumbledore's, halfway to sapphire.</p>
<p>In one hand the centaur held a long wooden spear, with an
overlarge metal blade whose edge did not gleam beneath the
moonlight; a gleaming edge, Harry had once read, was the sign of a
dull blade.</p>
<p>"So," the centaur said. His voice was low, powerful and male.
"Here you are, surrounded by destruction. I can smell the unicorn's
blood in the air, the blood of something innocent, slain to save
oneself."</p>
<p>A jolt of sudden fear brought Harry into the now, and he said
quickly, "It's not what it looks like."</p>
<p>"I know. The stars themselves proclaim your innocence,
ironically enough." The centaur took a step toward Harry within the
small clearing, still holding his spear upright. "A strange word,
<em>innocence.</em> It means lack of knowledge, like the innocence
of a child, and also means lack of guilt. Only those entirely
ignorant can lack all responsibility for the consequences of their
actions. He knows not what he does, and therefore can be without
harmful intent; so says that word." The deep voice did not echo in
the woods.</p>
<p>Harry's eyes flickered to the spear-tip, and he realized that he
should have grabbed his Time-Turner the moment he saw the centaur.
Now, if Harry tried to reach beneath his robes, the spear could
strike him before then, if the centaur was fast enough. "I read
once," Harry said, his voice a bit unsteady as he tried to match
deep-sounding words to deep-sounding words, "that it's wrong to
think of little children as innocent, because not knowing isn't the
same as not choosing. That children do little harms to each other
with schoolyard fights, because they don't have the power to do
great harm. And some adults do great harm. But the adults who
don't, aren't they more innocent than children, not less?"</p>
<p>"The wisdom of wizards," the centaur said.</p>
<p>"Muggle wisdom, actually."</p>
<p>"Of the magicless I know little. Mars has been dim of late, but
it grows brighter." The centaur took another step forwards,
bringing him almost within striking distance of Harry.</p>
<p>Harry didn't dare look up to the sky. "That means Mars is coming
closer to the Earth, as both planets go around the Sun. Mars is
reflecting the same amount of sunlight as always, it's just getting
nearer to us. What do you mean, the stars proclaim my
innocence?"</p>
<p>"The night sky speaks to centaurs. It is how we know what we
know. Or do they not even tell wizards that much, these days?" A
look of contempt crossed the centaur's face.</p>
<p>"I... tried to look up centaurs, when I was checking out
Divination. Most of the authors just ridiculed centaur Divination
without explaining why, wizards don't understand argumentative
norms, to them ridiculing an idea or a person feels like casting
that idea down just as much as bringing evidence against it... I
thought the part about centaurs using astrology was just more
ridicule..."</p>
<p>"Why?" the centaur intoned. His head cocked curiously.</p>
<p>"Because the course of the planets is predictable for thousands
of years in advance. If I talked to the right Muggles, I could show
you a diagram of exactly what the planets will look like from this
spot ten years later. Would you be able to make predictions from
that?"</p>
<p>The centaur shook his head. "From a diagram? No. The light of
the planets, the comets, the subtle shifts in the stars themselves,
those I would not see."</p>
<p>"Cometary orbits are also set thousands of years in advance so
they shouldn't correlate much to current events. And the light of
the stars takes years to travel from the stars to Earth, and the
stars don't move much at all, not visibly. So the obvious
hypothesis is that centaurs have a native magical talent for
Divination which you just, well, <em>project</em> onto the night
sky."</p>
<p>"Perhaps," the centaur said thoughtfully. His head lowered. "The
others would strike you for saying such a thing, but I have ever
sought to know what I do not know. Why the night sky can foretell
the future - that I surely do not know. It is hard enough to grasp
the skill itself. All I can say, son of Lily, is that even if what
you are saying is true, it does not seem useful."</p>
<p>Harry allowed himself to relax a little; being addressed as 'son
of Lily' implied that the centaur thought of him as more than a
random intruder in the forest. Besides, attacking a Hogwarts
student would probably bring some kind of huge reprisal upon the
non-wizard centaur tribe in the forests, and the centaur probably
knew that... "What Muggles have learned is that there is a power in
the truth, in all the pieces of the truth which interact with each
other, which you can only find by discovering as many truths as
possible. To do that you can't defend false beliefs in any way, not
even by saying the false belief is useful. It might not seem to
matter whether your predictions are really based on the stars or if
it's an innate talent being projected. But if you wanted to really
understand Divination, or for that matter the stars, the real truth
about centaur predictions would be a fact that matters to other
truths."</p>
<p>Slowly the centaur nodded. "So the wandless have become wiser
than the wizards. What a joke! Tell me, son of Lily, do the Muggles
in their wisdom say that soon the skies will be empty?"</p>
<p>"Empty?" Harry said. "Er... no?"</p>
<p>"The other centaurs in this forest have stayed from your
presence, for we are sworn not to set ourselves against the
heavens' course. Because, in becoming entangled in your fate, we
might become less innocent in what is to come. I alone have dared
approach you."</p>
<p>"I... don't understand."</p>
<p>"No. You are innocent, as the stars say. And to slay something
innocent to save oneself, that is a terrible deed. One would live
only a cursed life, a half-life, from that day. For any centaur
would surely be cast out, if he slew a foal."</p>
<p>The spear made a lightning motion, too fast for Harry's eyes to
follow, and smashed his wand out of his hand.</p>
<p>Another powerful blow smashed into Harry's solar plexus, and he
went gasping and retching to the forest floor.</p>
<p>Harry's hand reached up toward his robes, for his Time-Turner,
and the spear-butt knocked his hand away, almost hard enough to
break fingers, he reached with his other hand and that was knocked
away too -</p>
<p>"I am sorry, Harry Potter," the centaur said, and then looked up
with widened eyes. The spear spun about and came up, intercepting a
red spellbolt. Then the centaur dropped the spear and leaped away
desperately, a green flash of light went past him and another green
flash of light followed in its wake, then a third green flash hit
the centaur straight-on.</p>
<p>The centaur fell and did not move again.</p>
<p>It took a long time for Harry to catch his breath, to stagger to
his feet, to pick up his wand, to croak, "What?"</p>
<p>By that time the sense of doom, of power almost tangible in the
air, had approached once more.</p>
<p>"P-Professor Quirrell? What are you doing here?"</p>
<p>"Well," the man in the black cloak said thoughtfully,
"<em>you</em> needed to fly into a rage and have a loud tantrum in
the Forbidden Forest in the middle of the night, and <em>I</em>
needed to go just outside your ability to detect me and keep watch.
One does not leave a student alone in the Forbidden Forest. That
should be obvious in retrospect."</p>
<p>Harry stared at the fallen centaur.</p>
<p>The horse-form wasn't breathing.</p>
<p>"You - you <em>killed</em> him, that was Avada Kedavra -"</p>
<p>"I do not always understand how other people imagine morality to
work, Mr. Potter. But even I know that on conventional morality, it
is acceptable to kill nonhuman creatures which are about to slay a
wizard child. Perhaps you do not care about the nonhuman part, but
he was about to <em>kill</em> you. He was hardly innocent -"</p>
<p>The Defense Professor stopped, looking at Harry, who had raised
one trembling hand to his mouth.</p>
<p>"Well," the Defense Professor said then, "I have made my point,
and you may think on it. Centaur spears can block many spells, but
no one tries to block if they see that the spell is a certain shade
of green. For this purpose it is useful to know some green stunning
hexes. Really, Mr. Potter, you should understand by now how I
operate."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor came nearer the centaur's body, and Harry
took an involuntary step back, then another, at the terrible rising
sense of <em>STOP, DON'T -</em></p>
<p>The Defense Professor kneeled and pressed his wand to the
centaur's head.</p>
<p>The wand stayed there for a time.</p>
<p>And the centaur rose, eyes blank, breathing once more.</p>
<p>"Remember nothing of this time," the Defense Professor
commanded. "Wander away and forget everything about this
night."</p>
<p>The centaur walked away, the four horse-legs moving in strange
synchrony.</p>
<p>"Happy now?" the Defense Professor said, sounding rather
sardonic about it.</p>
<p>Harry's brain still felt broken. "He was trying to <em>kill</em>
me."</p>
<p>"Oh, for Merlin's sake - yes, he was trying to kill you. Get
used to it. Only boring people never have that experience."</p>
<p>Harry's voice emerged, hoarse. "Why - why did he want to -"</p>
<p>"Any number of reasons. I would be lying if I said I'd never
considered killing you myself."</p>
<p>Harry stared at where the centaur had wandered into the
trees.</p>
<p>His brain still felt half-broken, like an engine misfiring, but
Harry did not see how this could possibly be a good sign.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The news of Draco Malfoy nearly being eaten by a horror had been
sufficient to summon back Dumbledore from wherever he'd gone, to
wake Lord Malfoy and the Lady Greengrass's handsome husband, to
bring forth Amelia Bones. The supposed presence of the horror had
provoked skepticism even from Dumbledore, and the possibility of
False Memory Charms had been raised. Harry had said (after some
internal debate about the consequences of people believing a demon
was on the loose) that he didn't actually remember making the same
effort he'd put forth to frighten the Dementor, the dark thing had
just left; which was what you would expect someone to create as a
False Memory, if they hadn't actually known how Harry had done it.
The names of Bellatrix Black, Severus Snape, and Quirinus Quirrell
had been mentioned in connection with wizards strong enough to
subdue everyone present and cast False Memory Charms, and Harry had
known that Lucius was thinking of Dumbledore. There had been Aurors
testifying, and discussions going in circles, and glares of
accusation, and cutting remarks at 2AM in the morning. There had
been motions, and votes, and consequences.</p>
<p>"Do you believe," Headmaster Dumbledore said quietly to Harry,
when all of it was done, and the two of them alone, "that the
Hogwarts you have wrought is an improvement?"</p>
<p>Harry sat with his elbows on his knees, his face resting on his
palms, in the conference room from which all the others had now
departed. Professor McGonagall, who did not use a Time-Turner as
routinely as the two of them, had departed swiftly for her bed.</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry answered after too long a hesitation. "From my
perspective, Headmaster, things in Hogwarts are finally, finally
normal. This is how things should be, when four children get sent
into the Forbidden Forest at night. There should be a huge fuss,
constables showing up, and the responsible party getting
sacked."</p>
<p>"You believe it is good," Dumbledore said quietly, "that the man
who you call responsible was, as you put it, sacked."</p>
<p>"Yes, in fact, I do."</p>
<p>"Argus Filch has served this institution for decades."</p>
<p>"And when given Veritaserum," Harry said tiredly, "Argus Filch
revealed that he had sent an eleven-year-old boy into the Forbidden
Forest, hoping something awful would happen to him, because he
thought the boy's father had been responsible for the death of his
cat. The three other students in Draco's company don't seem to have
fazed him. I would have argued for jail time, but your concept of
jail in this country is Azkaban. I'll also note that Filch was
remarkably unpleasant to the children in Hogwarts and I expect the
school's hedonic index to be improved by his departure, not that it
matters to you, I suppose."</p>
<p>The Headmaster's eyes were impenetrable behind the half-moon
glasses. "Argus Filch is a Squib. His work at Hogwarts is all he
has. Had, rather."</p>
<p>"The purpose of a school is not to provide work for its
employees. I know you probably spent more time around Filch than
around any individual student, but that shouldn't make Filch's
inner experiences loom larger in your thoughts. Students have inner
lives too."</p>
<p>"You don't care at all, do you Harry?" Dumbledore's voice was
quiet. "About those you hurt."</p>
<p>"I care about the innocent," Harry said. "Like Mr. Hagrid, who
you'll note I argued should not be considered malicious, just
oblivious. I was fine with Mr. Hagrid working here so long as he
didn't take anyone into the Forbidden Forest again."</p>
<p>"I had thought that with Rubeus vindicated, he might teach Care
of Magical Creatures after Silvanus departs the position. But much
of that teaching is done in the Forbidden Forest. So that too shall
not be, in the wake of your passage."</p>
<p>Harry said slowly, "But - you told us that Mr. Hagrid has a
blind spot when it comes to magical creatures threatening wizards.
That Mr. Hagrid had a cognitive deficit and couldn't really imagine
Draco and Tracey getting hurt, which was why Mr. Hagrid didn't see
anything wrong with leaving them alone in the Forbidden Forest at
night. Was that not true?"</p>
<p>"It is true."</p>
<p>"Then wouldn't Mr. Hagrid be the worst possible teacher for
Magical Creatures?"</p>
<p>The old wizard gazed down at Harry through the half-moon
glasses. His voice was thick when he spoke. "Mr. Malfoy himself saw
nothing awry. It was not so implausible a trick which Argus played,
Harry Potter. And Rubeus might have grown into his position. It
would have been - all Rubeus wished, his one greatest desire -"</p>
<p>"Your mistake," Harry said, looking down at his knees, feeling
at least ten percent as exhausted as he'd ever been, "is a
cognitive bias we would call, in the trade, scope insensitivity.
Failure to multiply. You're thinking about how happy Mr. Hagrid
would be when he heard the news. Consider the next ten years and a
thousand students taking Magical Creatures and ten percent of them
being scalded by Ashwinders. No one student would be hurt as much
as Mr. Hagrid would be happy, but there'd be a hundred students
being hurt and only one happy teacher."</p>
<p>"Perhaps," the old wizard said. "And your own error, Harry, is
that you do not feel the pain of those you hurt, once you have done
your multiplication."</p>
<p>"Maybe." Harry went on staring at his knees. "Or maybe it's
worse than that. Headmaster, what does it mean if a centaur doesn't
like me?" <em>What does it mean when a member of a race of magical
creatures known for Divination gives you a lecture on people who
are ignorant of consequences, apologizes, and then tries to stab
you with a spear?</em></p>
<p>"A centaur?" the Headmaster said. "When did you - ah, the
Time-Turner. You are the reason why I could not travel back to
before the event, on pain of paradox."</p>
<p>"Am I? I guess I am." Harry shook his head distantly.
"Sorry."</p>
<p>"With very few exceptions," Dumbledore said, "centaurs do not
like wizards, at all."</p>
<p>"This was a bit more specific than that."</p>
<p>"What did the centaur say to you?"</p>
<p>Harry didn't reply.</p>
<p>"Ah." The Headmaster hesitated. "Centaurs have been wrong many
times, and if there is anyone in the world who could confuse the
stars themselves, it is you."</p>
<p>Harry looked up, and saw the blue eyes once more gentle behind
the half-circle glasses.</p>
<p>"Do not fret too much about it," said Albus Dumbledore.</p>

<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 102: Caring<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p><em>June 3rd, 1992.</em></p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was very sick.</p>
<p>He'd seemed better for a while, after drinking his unicorn's
blood in May, but the air of intense power which had surrounded him
afterward hadn't lasted even a day. By the Ides of May, Professor
Quirrell's hands had been trembling again, though subtly. The
Defense Professor's medical regimen had been interrupted too early,
it seemed.</p>
<p>Six days ago Professor Quirrell had collapsed at dinnertime.</p>
<p>Madam Pomfrey had tried to forbid Professor Quirrell from
teaching classes, and Professor Quirrell had shouted at her in
front of everyone. The Defense Professor had shouted that he was
dying regardless, and would use his remaining time as he chose.</p>
<p>So Madam Pomfrey, blinking hard, had forbidden the Defense
Professor from doing anything <em>except</em> teaching his classes.
She'd asked for a volunteer to help her take Professor Quirrell to
a room in the Hogwarts infirmary. More than a hundred students had
risen to their feet, only half wearing green.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor no longer sat at the Head Table during
mealtimes. He didn't cast spells during lessons. The oldest
students who had the most Quirrell points helped him to teach, the
seventh-years who had already sat their Defense N.E.W.T.s in May.
They took turns floating him from his room in the infirmary to his
classes, and brought him food at mealtimes. Professor Quirrell
proctored his Battle Magic classes from a chair, sitting.</p>
<p>Watching Hermione die had hurt more than this, but that had
ended much more quickly.</p>
<p><em>This is the true Enemy.</em></p>
<p>Harry had already thought that, after Hermione had died. Being
forced to watch Professor Quirrell die, day by day, week by week,
had not done much to change his mind.</p>
<p><em>This is the true Enemy I have to face,</em> Harry thought in
Wednesday's Defense class, watching Professor Quirrell leaning far
to one side of his chair before that day's seventh-year assistant
caught him. <em>Everything else is just shadows and
distraction.</em></p>
<p>Harry had been turning over Trelawney's prophecy in his mind,
wondering if maybe the true Dark Lord had nothing to do with Lord
Voldemort at all. <em>Born to those who have thrice defied him</em>
seemed to strongly invoke the Peverell brothers and the three
Deathly Hallows - though Harry didn't exactly see how Death could
have marked him as an equal, which seemed to imply some sort of
deliberate action on Death's part.</p>
<p><em>This alone is the true Enemy,</em> Harry thought. <em>After
this will come Professor McGonagall, Mum and Dad, even Neville in
his time, unless the wound in the world can be healed before
then.</em></p>
<p>There was nothing Harry could do. Madam Pomfrey was already
doing for Professor Quirrell what magic could do, and magic seemed
strictly superior to Muggle techniques when it came to healing.</p>
<p>There was nothing Harry could do.</p>
<p>Nothing he could do.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>Nothing at all.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry raised his hand, and knocked upon the door, in case the
person there could no longer detect him.</p>
<p>"What is it?" came a strained voice from the infirmary room.</p>
<p>"It's me."</p>
<p>There was a long pause. "Come in," said that voice.</p>
<p>Harry slipped inside and closed the door behind him, and cast
the Quieting Charm. He stood as far away from Professor Quirrell as
he could, just in case his own magic was making the Professor feel
uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Though the sense of doom was fading, fading with each passing
day.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was lying back in his infirmary bed, only his
head propped up by a pillow. A coverlet of cottony material, red
with black stitching, covered him to his chest. A book hovered
before his eyes, outlined in a pale glow which also surrounded a
black cube lying by the bed. Not the Defense Professor's own magic,
then, but a device of some kind.</p>
<p>The book was <em>Thinking Physics</em> by Epstein, the same book
Harry had lent to Draco a few months back. Harry had stopped
fretting about its possible misuse several weeks earlier.</p>
<p>"This -" Professor Quirrell said, and coughed, it didn't sound
quite right. "This is a fascinating book... if I'd ever
realized..." A laugh, mixed with another cough. "Why did I assume
the Muggle arts... must not be mine? That they would be... of no
use to me? Why did I never bother trying... to test it
experimentally... as you would say? In case... my assumption... was
wrong? It seems sheerly foolish of me... in retrospect..."</p>
<p>Harry was having more trouble speaking than Professor Quirrell
was. Wordlessly, Harry reached into his pocket, and laid a kerchief
on the floor; which he unfolded to reveal a small white pebble,
smooth and round.</p>
<p>"What's that?" said the Defense Professor.</p>
<p>"It's a, it's a, Transfigured, unicorn."</p>
<p>Harry had checked the books, had learned that since he was too
young to have sexual thoughts he would be able to approach a
unicorn without fear. The same books had said nothing about
unicorns being smart. Harry had already noticed that every
intelligent magical species was at least partially humanoid, from
merfolk to centaurs to giants, from elves to goblins to veela. All
had essentially humanlike emotions, many were known to interbreed
with humans. Harry had already reasoned out that magic didn't
create new intelligence but just changed the shape of genetically
human beings. Unicorns were equinoid, were not even partially
humanoid, didn't talk, used no tools, they were almost certainly
just magical horses. If it was right to eat a cow to feed yourself
for a day, then it <em>had</em> to be right to drink a unicorn's
blood in order to stave off death for weeks. You couldn't have it
both ways.</p>
<p>So Harry had gone into the Forbidden Forest wearing his Cloak.
He had searched the Grove of Unicorns until he saw her, a proud
creature with a pure white coat and violet hair, with three blue
blotches on her flank. Harry had gone over, and the sapphire eyes
had stared at him inquisitively. Harry had tapped out the sequence
1-2-3 on the ground several times with his shoes. The unicorn had
shown no sign of responding in kind. Harry had reached over, taken
her hoof in his hand, and tapped the same sequence with the
unicorn's hoof. The unicorn had only looked at him curiously.</p>
<p>And something about feeding the unicorn the
sleeping-potion-laced sugar cubes had still felt like murder.</p>
<p><em>That magic gives their existence a weight of meaning which
no mere animal could possess... to slay something innocent to save
oneself, that is a very grave sin.</em> Those two phrases, from
Professor McGonagall, from the centaur, had both run through
Harry's mind, over and over as the white unicorn had yawned, laid
down on the ground, and closed its eyes for what would be the last
time. The Transfiguration had lasted an hour, and Harry's eyes had
watered repeatedly as he worked. The unicorn's death might not have
come then, but it would come soon enough, and it was foreign to
Harry's nature to try to refuse responsibility of any kind. Harry
would just have to hope that, if you didn't kill the unicorn to
save yourself, if you did it to help a friend, it would be
acceptable in the end.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's eyebrows had climbed toward his hairline.
His voice was less soft, had something of his normal sharpness, as
he said, "I forbid you from doing that again."</p>
<p>"I wondered if you'd say that," Harry said. He swallowed again.
"But this unicorn is already, already doomed, so you might as well
take it, Professor..."</p>
<p>"Why have you done this?"</p>
<p>If the Defense Professor really didn't understand that, he was
slower on the uptake than anyone Harry had ever met. "I kept
thinking there was nothing I could do," Harry said. "I got tired of
thinking it."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell closed his eyes. His head leaned back into
the pillow. "You were lucky," the Defense Professor said in a soft
voice, "that a unicorn in Transfigured form... did not set off the
Hogwarts wards, as a strange creature... I shall have to... take
this outside the grounds, to make use of it... but that can be
managed. I shall tell them that I wish to look upon the lake... I
will ask you to sustain the Transfiguration before you go, and it
should last long enough, after that... and with my last strength,
dispel whatever death-alarms were placed to watch over the herd...
which, the unicorn being not yet dead, but only Transfigured, will
not yet have triggered... you were very lucky, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>Harry nodded. He started to speak, then stopped again. Words
seemed to stick in his throat once more.</p>
<p><em>You already calculated the expected utilities, if it works,
if it goes wrong. You assigned probabilities, you multiplied, and
then you threw out the answer and went with your new gut feeling,
which was the same. So say it.</em></p>
<p>"Do you know," Harry said unsteadily, "of any way at all, by
which your life might be saved?"</p>
<p>The Defense Professor's eyes opened. "Why... do you ask me that,
boy?"</p>
<p>"There's... a spell I heard of, a ritual -"</p>
<p>"Be silent," said the Defense Professor.</p>
<p>An instant later a snake lay in the bed.</p>
<p>Even the snake's eyes were dull.</p>
<p>It did not rise.</p>
<p>"<em>Sspeak on,"</em> hissed that snake, its flickering tongue
its only motion.</p>
<p>"There is... <em>there iss a ritual, I heard of from the
sschoolmasster, by which he thinkss the Dark Lord might have lived
on. It iss called -"</em> and Harry stopped, as he realized that he
did know how to say the word in Parseltongue. "<em>Horcrux. It
requiress a death, I have heard. But if you are dying in any casse,
you might try to adapt the ritual, even at great rissk for the new
sspell, sso that it can be done with a different ssacrifice. It
would change the whole world, if you ssucceed - though I don't know
anything about the sspell - the sschoolmasster thought it tore off
a piece of ssoul, though I don't ssee how that could be true
-"</em></p>
<p>The snake was hissing laughter, strange sharp laughter, almost
hysterical. "<em>You tell me of that sspell? Me? You musst learn
more caution in the future, boy. But it matterss not. I learned of
the horcrux sspell ssince long ago. It iss meaninglesss."</em></p>
<p>"Meaningless?" Harry said aloud in surprise.</p>
<p>"<em>Would be pointlesss sspell from beginning, if ssoulss
exissted.</em> <em>Tear piece of ssoul? That iss lie. Missdirection
to hide true ssecret. Only one who doess not believe in common
liess will reasson further, ssee beneath obsscuration, realisse how
to casst sspell. Required murder iss not ssacrificial ritual at
all. Ssudden death ssometimes makess ghosst, if magic burssts and
imprintss on nearby thing. Horcrux sspell channelss death-bursst
through casster, createss your own ghosst insstead of victim'ss,
imprintss ghosst in sspecial device. Ssecond victim pickss up
horcrux device, device imprintss your memoriess into them. But only
memoriess from time horcrux device wass made. You ssee
flaw?"</em></p>
<p>The burning sensation was back in Harry's throat. "<em>No
continuity of -</em>" there wasn't a snake word for consciousness
"- <em>sself, you would go on thinking after making the horcrux,
then sself with new memoriess diess and iss not resstored
-"</em></p>
<p><em>"Yess, you do ssee. Alsso Merlin'ss Interdict preventss
powerful sspells from passing through ssuch a device, ssince it iss
not truly alive. Dark Wizardss who think to return thuss are
weaker, eassily disspatched. None have perssissted long by ssuch
meanss. Perssonalitiess change, mix with victim'ss. Death iss not
truly gainssaid. Real sself is losst, as you ssay. Not to my
pressent tasste. Admit I conssidered it, long ago."</em></p>
<p>A man was lying in the infirmary bed once more. The Defense
Professor breathed, then made a wretched coughing sound.</p>
<p>"Can you give me a full recipe for the spell?" Harry said, after
a moment's deliberation. "There might be some way to improve on the
flaws, with enough research. Some way to do it ethically and have
it work." Like doing the transfer into a clone body with a blank
brain, instead of an innocent victim, which might also improve the
fidelity of the personality transfer... though that still left the
other problems.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell made a short sound, under his breath, that
might have been laughter. "You know, boy," Professor Quirrell
whispered, "I had thought... to teach you everything... the seeds
of all the secrets I knew... from one living mind to another... so
that later, when you found the right books, you would be able to
understand... I would have passed on my knowledge to you, my
heir... we would have begun as soon as you asked me... but you
never asked."</p>
<p>Even the grief surrounding by Harry like thick water gave way to
that, to the sheer magnitude of the missed opportunity. "I was
supposed to - ? I didn't know I was supposed to - !"</p>
<p>Another coughing chuckle. "Ah yes... the unknowing Muggleborn...
in heritage if not in blood... that is you. But I thought... better
of it... that you should not walk my path... it was not a good
path, in the end."</p>
<p>"It's not too late, Professor!" Harry said. A part of Harry
yelled that he was being selfish, and then another part shouted
that down; there would be other people to help.</p>
<p>"Yes, it is too late... and you shall not... persuade me
otherwise... I have... thought better of it... as I said... I am
too full... of secrets better left unknown... <em>look at
me.</em>"</p>
<p>Harry looked, almost despite himself.</p>
<p>He saw a still-unwrinkled face, looking old and pained, beneath
a head rapidly losing its hair, even the sides looking wispy now;
Harry saw a face he'd always thought was sharp, now revealed as
<em>thin,</em> muscle and fat fading away from the face, as from
the arms beneath it, like the skeletal form of Bellatrix Black he'd
seen in Azkaban -</p>
<p>Harry's head wrenched aside, unthinkingly.</p>
<p>"You see," whispered the Professor. "I dislike to sound
cliched... Mr. Potter... but the truth is... the Arts called
Dark... really are not good for a person... in the end."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell breathed in, breathed out. There was quiet
for a time in the infirmary, the two of them watched only by the
elaborately ornamented stone of the walls.</p>
<p>"Is there anything left... unsaid between us?" said Professor
Quirrell. "I am not dying today... mind you... not right now... but
I do not know how long... I shall be able to converse."</p>
<p>"There's," Harry said, swallowed again. "There's a lot of
things, way too many things, but... it might be the wrong thing to
ask, but I don't want - this one question unanswered - snake?"</p>
<p>A snake lay on the bed.</p>
<p>"<em>I learned how the Killing Cursse workss. Requiress true
hate to casst, not much hate, but musst want target dead, they
ssay. In prisson with life-eaterss, you casst Killing Cursse at
guard - ssaid you did not want him dead - wass that lie? Here, now,
at thiss disstance - you may sspeak truth - even if you fear it
reflectss poorly on you - it sshould not matter now, teacher. I
wissh to know. Musst know. Will not abandon you, either
way."</em></p>
<p>A man lay on the bed.</p>
<p>"Listen carefully," Professor Quirrell whispered. "I will tell
you a conundrum... a riddle of a dangerous spell... when you know
the answer to that puzzle... you will also know... the answer to
your question... are you listening?"</p>
<p>Harry nodded.</p>
<p>"There is a limitation... to the Killing Curse. To cast it
once... in a fight... you must hate enough... to want the other
dead. To cast Avada... Kedavra twice... you must hate enough... to
kill twice... to cut their throat with your own hands... to watch
them die... then do it again. Very few... can hate enough... to
kill someone... five times... they would... get bored." The Defense
Professor breathed several times, before continuing. "But if you
look at history... you will find some Dark Wizards... who could
cast the Killing Curse... over and over. A nineteenth-century
witch... who called herself Dark Evangel... the Aurors called her
A. K. McDowell. She could cast the Killing Curse... a dozen
times... in one fight. Ask yourself... as I asked myself... what is
the secret... that she knew? What is deadlier than hate... and
flows without limit?"</p>
<p><em>A second level to the Avada Kedavra spell, just like with
the Patronus Charm...</em></p>
<p>"I don't really care," Harry answered.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor chuckled wetly. "Good. You are...
learning. So you see..." A pause of transformation. "<em>I did not
wissh guard dead, after all. Casst Killing Cursse, but not with
hate.</em>" And then a man.</p>
<p>Harry swallowed hard. It was both better, and worse, than what
Harry had suspected; and characteristic enough of Professor
Quirrell. A cracked soul, for certain; but Professor Quirrell had
never claimed to be whole.</p>
<p>"Any else... to say?" said the man in the bed.</p>
<p>"Are you absolutely sure," Harry said, "that there is nothing
you've ever heard of that might save you, Professor? In all your
lore? Finding and uniting all three Deathly Hallows, an ancient
artifact that Merlin sealed behind a riddle nobody's ever figured
out? You've seen some of what I can do. That I'm good at solving
riddles. You know I can figure things out, sometimes, that other
wizards can't. I -" Harry's voice broke. "I have a strong
preference for your life, over your death, Professor Quirrell."</p>
<p>There was a long pause.</p>
<p>"One thing," whispered Professor Quirrell. "One thing... that
might do it... or it might not... but to obtain it... is beyond
your power, or mine..."</p>
<p><em>Oh, it was just the setup for a subquest,</em> said Harry's
Inner Critic.</p>
<p>All the other parts screamed for that part to shut up. Life
didn't work like that. Ancient artifacts could be found, but not in
a month, not when you couldn't leave Hogwarts and were still in
your first year.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell took in a deep breath. Exhaled. "I'm sorry...
that came out... too dramatic. Do not... get your hopes up... Mr.
Potter. You asked... for anything... no matter how unlikely. There
is... a certain object... called..."</p>
<p>A snake lay on the bed.</p>
<p><em>"The Philossopher'ss Sstone,</em>" hissed the snake.</p>
<p>If there'd been a mass-manufacturable means of safe immortality
this entire time and nobody had bothered, Harry was going to snap
and kill everyone.</p>
<p><em>"I read of it in a book,"</em> Harry hissed. <em>"Concluded
it wass obviouss myth. No reason why ssame device would provide
immortality and endlesss gold. Not unlesss ssomeone wass jusst
inventing happy sstoriess. Not to mention, every ssane persson
sshould have been ressearching wayss to make more Sstoness, or
kidnapping maker to produce. Thought of you sspecifically,
teacher."</em></p>
<p>A hissing of cold laughter. <em>"Reassoning iss wisse, but not
wisse enough. Like with horcrux sspell, abssurdity hidess true
ssecret. True Sstone iss not what that legend ssayss. True power
iss not what sstoriess claim. Sstone's ssuppossed maker wass not
one who made it. One who holdss it now, wass not born to name now
ussed. Yet Sstone iss powerful healing device in truth. Have you
heard it sspoken of?"</em></p>
<p><em>"Jusst in the book.</em>"</p>
<p><em>"One who holdss Sstone iss repossitory of much lore. Taught
sschoolmasster many ssecretss. Sschoolmasster hass ssaid nothing of
Sstone'ss holder, nothing of Sstone? No hintss?"</em></p>
<p><em>"Not that I can eassily recall,</em>" Harry replied
honestly.</p>
<p><em>"Ah,"</em> hissed the snake. <em>"Ah, well."</em></p>
<p><em>"Could assk sschoolmasster -"</em></p>
<p><em>"No! Do not assk him, boy. He would not take quesstion
well."</em></p>
<p><em>"But if the Sstone only healss -"</em></p>
<p><em>"Sschoolmasster doess not believe that, would not believe
that. Too many have ssought Sstone, or ssought holder's lore. Do
not assk. Musst not assk. Do not try to obtain Sstone yoursself. I
forbid."</em></p>
<p>A man lay on the bed once more. "I am at... my limit..." said
Professor Quirrell. "I must regain... my strength... before I go...
to the forest... with your gift. Leave now... but sustain the
Transfiguration... before you go."</p>
<p>Harry reached out, touched the white pebble lying within the
kerchief, renewing the Transfiguration on it. "It should last for
one hour and fifty-three minutes after this," Harry said.</p>
<p>"Your studies... do well."</p>
<p>It was far longer than Harry's Transfigurations had lasted at
the start of the school year. Second-year spells came to him easily
now, without strain; which wasn't surprising, since he would be
twelve in less than two months. Harry could even have cast a Memory
Charm, if it had been good for someone to forget every memory
involving their left arm. He was climbing the power ladder, slowly,
from very far down.</p>
<p>The thought came with a potential for sadness, a thought of one
door opening as another closed; which Harry also rejected.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The door to the infirmary closed behind Harry, as the
Boy-Who-Lived walked swiftly and with purpose, shrugging on his
Invisibility Cloak as he moved. Soon, presumably, Professor
Quirrell would call for assistance; and an older student trio would
guide the Defense Professor into some quiet place, maybe the
forest, with an excuse of viewing the lake or some such. Someplace
the Defense Professor could eat a unicorn undetected, after Harry's
Transfiguration wore off.</p>
<p>And then Professor Quirrell would be healthier, for a time. His
power would return to him as strong as he'd ever been, for a much
shorter time.</p>
<p>It wouldn't last.</p>
<p>Harry's fists clenched as he strode, the tension radiating up
his arm muscles. If the Defense Professor's treatment regimen
hadn't been interrupted, by Harry and the Aurors that <em>he</em>
had brought to Hogwarts...</p>
<p>It was stupid to blame himself, Harry knew it was stupid and
somehow his brain was doing it anyway. Like his brain was
searching, carefully finding and selecting some way for this to be
his fault, no matter how far it had to stretch.</p>
<p>As if having things be his fault were the only way that his
brain knew how to grieve.</p>
<p>A trio of seventh-year Slytherins passed Harry's invisible form
in the hallway, heading for the healer's offices where the
Professor waited, looking deeply serious and concerned. Was that
how other people grieved?</p>
<p>Or did they, on some level, not really <em>care,</em> as
Professor Quirrell thought?</p>
<p><em>There is a second level to the Killing Curse.</em></p>
<p>Harry's brain had solved the riddle instantly, in the moment of
first hearing it; as though the knowledge had always been inside
him, waiting to make itself known.</p>
<p>Harry had read once, somewhere, that the opposite of happiness
wasn't sadness, but boredom; and the author had gone on to say that
to find happiness in life you asked yourself not what would make
you happy, but what would excite you. And by the same reasoning,
hatred wasn't the true opposite of love. Even hatred was a kind of
respect that you could give to someone's existence. If you cared
about someone enough to prefer their dying to their living, it
meant you were thinking about them.</p>
<p>It had come up much earlier, before the Trial, in conversation
with Hermione; when she'd said something about magical Britain
being Prejudiced, with considerable and recent justification. And
Harry had thought - but not said - that at least she'd been let
into Hogwarts to be spat upon.</p>
<p>Not like certain people living in certain countries, who were,
it was <em>said</em>, as human as anyone else; who were
<em>said</em> to be sapient beings, worth more than any mere
unicorn. But who nonetheless wouldn't be allowed to live in Muggle
Britain. On that score, at least, no Muggle had the right to look a
wizard in the eye. Magical Britain might discriminate against
Muggleborns, but at least it allowed them inside so they could be
spat upon in person.</p>
<p><em>What is deadlier than hate, and flows without
limit?</em></p>
<p>"Indifference," Harry whispered aloud, the secret of a spell he
would never be able to cast; and kept striding toward the library
to read anything he could find, anything at all, about the
Philosopher's Stone.</p>
</div>
<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 103: Tests<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p><em>June 4th, 1992.</em></p>
<p>Daphne Greengrass was in the Slytherin common room, writing a
letter to her Lady Mother (who was surprisingly intransigent about
power-sharing, despite not even <em>being</em> in Hogwarts to
exercise control) when she saw Draco Malfoy stagger in through the
portrait door carrying what must have been a dozen books, Vincent
and Gregory behind him each carrying a dozen more. The Auror who'd
accompanied Malfoy stuck his head in briefly, then withdrew to
who-knew-where.</p>
<p>Draco looked around, then seemed to be struck by a bright idea
as he staggered toward her, Vincent and Gregory following
after.</p>
<p>"Can you help me read these?" said Draco, sounding slightly out
of breath as he approached.</p>
<p>"What." Lessons were over<em>,</em> only the exams were left
now, and since when did <em>Malfoys</em> ask <em>Greengrasses</em>
for help with their homework?</p>
<p>"These," Draco Malfoy said importantly, "are all the library
books Miss Granger borrowed between April 1st and April 16th. I
thought I'd go through them in case there are any Clues there, only
then I thought, maybe <em>you</em> should help because you knew
Miss Granger better."</p>
<p>Daphne stared at the books. "The General read all that in
<em>two weeks?</em> " A twinge of pain went through her heart, but
she suppressed it.</p>
<p>"Well, I don't know if Miss Granger finished them all," Draco
said. He held up a cautioning finger. "In fact, we don't know if
she read any of them, or if she really borrowed them, I mean, all
we've <em>observed</em> is that the library ledger says she checked
them out -"</p>
<p>Daphne suppressed a groan. Malfoy had been talking like this for
weeks. There were some people who clearly were not meant to be
involved with mysterious murders because it did <em>strange things
to their minds</em>. "Mr. Malfoy, I couldn't read all these if I
spent my whole summer doing nothing else."</p>
<p>"Then just skim through them, please?" Draco said. "Especially
if there's, you know, mysterious words scribbled in her
handwriting, or a bookmark left inside, or -"</p>
<p>"I've seen those plays too, Mr. Malfoy." Daphne rolled her eyes.
"Don't we have <em>Aurors</em> now for -"</p>
<p>"<em>We're doomed!</em> " shrieked Millicent Bulstrode, as she
burst up from the lower chambers into the Slytherin common
room.</p>
<p>People paused to look at her.</p>
<p>"<em>It's Professor Quirrell!</em> "</p>
<p>A sudden air of attentiveness, as of long-standing disputes
about to be settled. "Well, finally," someone said, as Millicent
tried to catch her breath. "He's only got, what, ten days left to
go bad?"</p>
<p>"Eleven days," said the seventh-year who was running the betting
pool.</p>
<p>"<em>He's gotten a little better suddenly and he's going to
summon the first-years for our Defense final! By surprise! In fifty
minutes!</em> "</p>
<p>"A Defense final?" Pansy said blankly. "But Professor Quirrell
doesn't give exams."</p>
<p>"The <em>Ministry</em> Defense final!" shrieked Millicent.</p>
<p>"But Professor Quirrell doesn't teach anything from the Ministry
curriculum," objected Pansy.</p>
<p>Daphne was already fleeing to her room, racing for the
first-year Defense textbook that she hadn't touched since September
and screaming curses inside her mind.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>One desk back of her, someone was crying, their soft sobs
providing a background chant of despair for the classroom. Daphne
looked back, expecting to see a Hufflepuff and hoping it wasn't
Hannah, and was surprised at first (though not on further
reflection) to see it was a Ravenclaw.</p>
<p>Before them were set the exam parchments, turned over, waiting
for the bell.</p>
<p>Fifty minutes hadn't been nearly enough preparation time, but it
was something, and Daphne was now feeling ashamed that she hadn't
thought to send messengers to warn the Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Gryffindor Houses. They'd started giving House Points again just
three days ago, at the beginning of June, but the Auxiliary
Protective Special Committee still ought to promote House
unity.</p>
<p>Another Ravenclaw, sitting four desks to her left, also started
to cry. That was Katherine Tung of Dragon Army, if she recalled
correctly, whom she'd once seen take on three Sunshine Soldiers
simultaneously without a flinch.</p>
<p>Daphne had calmed down after the first couple of minutes of
frantic reading. It was just a test, not a <em>murder</em> or
anything; and if almost all the first-year students turned in
mostly blank parchments then it stood to reason that nobody would
be shamed. But Daphne could understand, if not exactly sympathize,
that Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs might not see it that way.</p>
<p>"He's evil," another Ravenclaw witch said in a shaking voice.
"One hundred percent pure Dark Wizard to the bone. The Dark Lord
Grindelwald wouldn't do this, not to children, he's worse than
You-Know-Who."</p>
<p>Daphne looked reflexively at where Professor Quirrell was
sitting, slumped to one side but his eyes alert; and she thought
she saw the Defense Professor smile for one tiny instant. No, that
had to be her imagination, there was no way the Defense Professor
could have heard that.</p>
<p>The bell rang.</p>
<p>Daphne flipped the parchment over.</p>
<p>The top was stamped with the seals for the Ministry, the
Hogwarts Board of Governors, and the Department of Magical
Education, and runes to detect cheating. Below that was a line for
her to write her name, and a list of exam rules with a picture of
Lindsay Gagnon, the Director of the Department of Magical
Education, shaking an admonishing finger at everyone.</p>
<p>Halfway down the page was the first exam question.</p>
<p>It was, <em>Why is it important for children to stay away from
strange creatures?</em></p>
<p>There was a stunned pause.</p>
<p>One student began laughing, she thought it was from the
Gryffindor section of the class. Professor Quirrell made no motion
to censor it, and the laughter spread.</p>
<p>Nobody spoke aloud, but the students looked around at each
other, exchanging glances as the laughter died down, and then as if
by some unspoken agreement they all looked at Professor Quirrell,
who was smiling down at them benevolently.</p>
<p>Daphne bent over her exam, wearing a defiant evil smile that
would have done proud to either Godric Gryffindor or Grindelwald;
and she wrote down, <em>Because my Stunning Hex, my Most Ancient
Blade, and my Patronus Charm won't work against
everything.</em></p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry Potter turned over the last page of his Defense exam.</p>
<p>Even Harry had needed to quash a small bit of nervousness, some
tiny remnant of his childhood, upon reading the first real question
('How can you make a Shrieking Eel be silent?'). Professor
Quirrell's lessons had spent roughly zero time on the surprising
yet useless trivia that some idiot had imagined a 'Defense class'
should look like. In principle, Harry could have used his
Time-Turner to read through the first-year Defense book after being
notified of the surprise exam; but that might have unfairly skewed
the grading curve for others. After staring at the question for a
couple of seconds, Harry had written down 'Quieting Charm', and
included the casting directions in case the Ministry grader didn't
believe that Harry knew it.</p>
<p>Once Harry had decided to just answer all the questions
<em>correctly,</em> the exam had gone by very quickly. The most
realistic answer to more than half the questions was 'Stunning
Hex', and many of the other questions had optimal solutions along
the lines of 'Turn around and walk in the opposite direction' or
'Throw away the cheese and buy a new pair of shoes.'</p>
<p>The last question on the test was "What would you do if you
suspected there might be a Bogeysnake underneath your bed?" The
Ministry-approved answer, Harry could in fact recall from his
read-through of the textbook at the start of the year, was <em>Tell
your parents.</em> The problem with this had occurred to Harry
right away, which was why Harry had remembered it.</p>
<p>After some pondering, Harry wrote down:</p>
<p><em>Dear Ministry grader: I'm afraid the real answer to that is
a secret, but rest assured that a Bogeysnake would present no more
trouble to me than a mountain troll, a Dementor, or You-Know-Who.
Please inform your superiors that I find your standard answer
prejudicial to Muggleborns, and that I expect this failing will be
corrected at once without any need for my direct
intervention.</em></p>
<p><em>Sincerely, the Boy-Who-Lived.</em></p>
<p>Harry signed the last parchment with a broad flourish, turned it
over into his stack, put down his quill, and sat up.</p>
<p>Looking around, Harry saw that Professor Quirrell seemed to be
looking in his rough direction, though the Defense Professor's head
had nodded to one side. The other students were still writing. Some
of them were silently crying, but they were still writing.
<em>Continuing to fight</em> was also a lesson Professor Quirrell
had taught.</p>
<p>Interminably later, the official exam time was up. A
seventh-year student went from desk to desk, collecting the exams
in Professor Quirrell's place.</p>
<p>The last exam parchment was collected, and Professor Quirrell
sat up straight.</p>
<p>"My young students," he said softly. The seventh-year student
had her wand trained on the Defense Professor's mouth, so that they
all heard his voice seeming to come from right beside them. "I
know... that probably seemed very fearsome to some of you... it is
a different kind of fear from facing the enemy's wand... you must
conquer it separately. So I... shall tell you this now. It is the
custom of Hogwarts... that grades are given in the second week of
June. But for my case... they can make an exception, I think." The
Defense Professor smiled his familiar dry smile, tinged now as
though by a suppressed grimace. "I know you are worried... that you
were not prepared for this exam... that my lessons have not covered
this material... and I quite forgot to mention... that it was
approaching... though you should have known... it would come in
time. But I have just now magically checked... the answers you have
given on that... terribly, terribly important final exam... though
of course only the Ministry grade is official... and assigned your
full-year grades taking the results into account... and magically
written your full grades down on these parchments," Professor
Quirrell tapped a stack of parchments on the side of his desk,
"which will now be handed out... an incredible spell... is it
not?"</p>
<p>A few students on the Ravenclaw side were looking indignant, but
for the most part the students just looked relieved, and some
Slytherins were chuckling. Harry would have laughed too, if not for
the pain of watching Professor Quirrell gasp out the words.</p>
<p>The seventh-year student standing beside Professor Quirrell
pointed her wand and spoke an incantation in magical pseudo-Latin.
The parchments rose up and started to drift through the air,
separating in mid-flow to drift toward each student.</p>
<p>Harry waited until his parchment had arrived on his desk, and
then unfolded it.</p>
<p>The parchment said EE+, which stood for Exceeds Expectations. It
was the second-highest grade letter, the highest being
Outstanding.</p>
<p>In another world, a distant vanished world, a little boy named
Harry would have shouted with indignation about receiving only the
second-highest grade. This Harry sat quietly and thought. Professor
Quirrell was making some point, and it wasn't as though the exact
grade letter mattered in any other way. Was Professor Quirrell
saying that Harry had done relatively well, but not lived up to his
full potential? Or was the grade meant to be read literally, that
Harry had in fact exceeded the Defense Professor's
expectations?</p>
<p>"All of you... pass," Professor Quirrell said, as the students
all looked at their final grades, as sighs of relief rose from
desks and Lavender Brown raised her parchment in a clenched fist
held high with triumph. "Every student in first-year Battle Magic
has passed... except for one."</p>
<p>A number of students looked up in sudden terror.</p>
<p>Harry sat there silently. He had seen the point immediately, and
even if it was a wrong point, he knew Professor Quirrell would
never, ever be talked out of making it.</p>
<p>"All of you in this room... have received grades of at least
Acceptable. Neville Longbottom... who took this test in the
Longbottom home... received a grade of Outstanding. But the other
student who is not here... has had a Dreadful grade entered on her
record... for failing the only important test... that was given her
this year. I would have marked her even lower... but that would
have been in poor taste."</p>
<p>The room was very quiet, though a number of students were
staring angrily at the Professor.</p>
<p>"You may think that a grade of Dreadful... is not fair. That
Miss Granger was faced with a test... for which her lessons... had
not prepared her. That she was not told... that the exam was coming
on that day."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor drew in a shaking breath.</p>
<p>"Such is realism," said Professor Quirrell. "The only important
test... may come at any time... be better prepared for it... than
she was. As for the rest of you... those who have received Exceeds
Expectations or above... have received my letters of
recommendation... to certain organizations beyond Britain's
shores... where your training might be completed. They will contact
you... when you are old enough... if you still appear worthy... and
if you have not failed an important test. And remember... from this
day... you must train yourselves... you cannot rely... on future
Defense professors. Your first year of Battle Magic is over... you
are dismissed."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell sat back with his eyes closed, seeming to
ignore the excited babble that broke out around him.</p>
<p>In time most of the students had departed, and one remained,
staying a prescribed distance from the Defense Professor.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor opened his eyes.</p>
<p>Harry raised the parchment with its <em>EE+,</em> still
silent.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor smiled, and it went all the way to those
tired eyes.</p>
<p>"It is the same grade... that I received in my own first
year."</p>
<p>"Th, th, th," Harry couldn't make the words <em>thank you</em>
come out, they were stuck in his suddenly closed throat, the
Defense Professor tilting his head and giving him an inquiring
stare, so Harry just bowed jerkily and then left the room.</p>

1<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p><em>May 13th, 1992.</em></p>
<p>Argus Filch's face appeared twisted in the light of the oil lamp
he held, shadows dancing over his face. Behind them the doors of
Hogwarts quickly receded, and the dark grounds moved closer. The
track they now walked was muddy and indistinct.</p>
<p>The trees, branches formerly bare with winter, were not yet
fully clad with spring; their branches stretched up toward the sky
like lean fingers, skeletons visible amid the thin foliage. The
moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it often threw them
into darkness, lit only by the dim flames of Filch's lamp.</p>
<p>Draco kept a firm grip on his wand.</p>
<p>"Where are you taking us?" said Tracey Davis. She'd been caught
along with Draco by Filch, on their way to an attempted meeting of
the Silvery Slytherins after curfew hours, and likewise given a
detention.</p>
<p>"You just follow me," said Argus Filch.</p>
<p>Draco was feeling rather annoyed with the whole affair. The
Silvery Slytherins ought to be recognized school business. There
was no reason why a secret conspiracy shouldn't have permission to
meet after curfew, if it was for the greater good of Hogwarts. If
this happened one more time he'd talk to Daphne Greengrass and
Daphne would talk to her father and then Filch would learn the
wisdom of looking the other way where Malfoys were concerned.</p>
<p>The lights of the Hogwarts castle had diminished in the distance
when Filch spoke again. "I bet you'll think twice about breaking a
school rule again, won't you, eh?" Filch turned his head, away from
the lamp, so that he could leer at the four students following him.
"Oh yes... hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask
me... It's just a pity they let the old punishments die out... hang
you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days, I've got the
chains still in my office, keep 'em well oiled in case they're ever
needed..."</p>
<p>"Hey!" Tracey said, a touch of indignation entering her voice.
"I'm too young to hear about that - that sort of - you know!
Especially if the chains are well-oiled!"</p>
<p>Draco wasn't paying attention. Filch simply wasn't in Amycus
Carrow's league.</p>
<p>Behind them, one of the two older Slytherins following them
snickered, though she didn't say anything. Beside her was the
other, a tall boy with an Slavic cast to his face, and who still
spoke with an accent. They'd been caught for some unrelated
offense, having to do with the type of thing Tracey went on about,
and looked to be in their third or fourth year. "Pfeh," said the
taller boy. "In Durmstrang they hang you upside-down by your toes.
By one toe, if you are insolent. Hogwarts was soft even in the old
days."</p>
<p>Argus Filch was silent for around half a minute, as though
trying to think of a proper rejoinder, and then gave a chuckle.
"We'll see what you say about that... when you learn what you'll be
doing tonight! Ha!"</p>
<p>"I <em>said,</em> I'm too young for that sort of thing!" said
Tracey Davis. "It has to wait until I'm older!"</p>
<p>Ahead of them was a cottage with lighted windows, though the
proportions seemed wrong.</p>
<p>Filch whistled, a high sharp sound, and a dog began barking.</p>
<p>From the cottage stepped forth a figure, making the trees seem
too short around it. The figure was followed by a dog that seemed
like a puppy by comparison, until you looked at it apart from the
taller silhouette and realized the dog was huge, more like a
wolf.</p>
<p>Draco's eyes narrowed, before he caught himself. As a Silvery
Slytherin he wasn't supposed to be Prejudiced against any sentient
being, especially not where other people might see him.</p>
<p>"What's this?" said the figure, in the loud gruff voice of the
half-giant. His umbrella lit up with a white glow, brighter than
Filch's dim lamp. In his other hand he held a crossbow; a quiver of
short bolts was strapped to his upper arm.</p>
<p>"Students serving detention," Filch said, loudly. "They're to
help you search the Forest for… whatever's been eating 'em."</p>
<p>"The <em>Forest?</em> " gasped Tracey. "We can't go in there at
night!"</p>
<p>"That's right," said Filch, turning from Hagrid to glare at
them. "It's into the Forest you're going, and I'm much mistaken if
you'll all come out in one piece."</p>
<p>"But -" said Tracey. "There's werewolves, I've heard,
<em>and</em> vampires, and everyone knows what happens when there's
a girl and a werewolf and a vampire all at the same time!"</p>
<p>The huge half-giant was frowning. "Argus, I 'ad in mind you an'
maybe a few seventh-years. 'Ere's not much point in bringing along
help if I'm to watch over 'em the whole time."</p>
<p>Argus's face lit with cruel satisfaction. "That's their lookout,
isn't it? Should've thought of them werewolves before they got in
trouble, shouldn't they? Send them out alone. I shouldn't be too
friendly to them, Hagrid. They're here to be punished, after
all."</p>
<p>The half-giant gave a massive sigh (it sounded like a normal man
having all the air driven out of his lungs by a Bludgeoning Hex).
"Yeh've done yer bit. I'll take over from here."</p>
<p>"I'll be back at dawn," said Filch, "for what's left of them,"
he added nastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle,
his lamp bobbing away in the darkness.</p>
<p>"Right then," said Hagrid, "now, listen carefully, 'cause it's
dangerous what we're gonna do tonight an' I don' want no one takin'
risks. Follow me over here a moment."</p>
<p>He led them to the very edge of the Forest. Holding his lamp up
high he pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared
into the thick black trees. A light breeze blew over Draco's head
as he looked into the Forest.</p>
<p>"There's summat in there that's bin eatin' unicorns," the huge
man said.</p>
<p>Draco nodded; he distantly remembered hearing something along
those lines a couple of weeks ago, toward the end of April.</p>
<p>"Did you call us to track down a trail of silvery blood to a
wounded unicorn?" Tracey said excitedly.</p>
<p>"No," said Draco, though he managed to stop the reflexive sneer.
"Filch gave us the detention note at lunch today, at noon. Mr.
Hagrid wouldn't wait that long to find a wounded unicorn, and if we
were looking for something like that, we'd look in the day when
it's bright. So," Draco held up a finger, like he'd seen Inspector
León do in plays, "I infer that we're looking for something that
only comes out at night."</p>
<p>"Aye," said the half-giant, sounding thoughtful. "Yer not what I
expected, Draco Malfoy. Not what I expected at all. An' you'd be
Tracey Davis, then. I've heard of yeh. One of poor Miss Granger's
lot." Rubeus Hagrid looked over at the two older Slytherins,
peering at them in the light of his glowing umbrella. "An' who'd
yeh be, again? Don't remember seeing much of yeh, boy."</p>
<p>"Cornelia Walt," said the witch, "and this is Yuri Yuliy,"
indicating the Slavic-looking boy who'd spoken of Durmstrang. "His
family is visiting from the Ukrainian lands, so he's in Hogwarts
just for the year." The older boy nodded, a faintly contemptuous
cast on his face.</p>
<p>"This is Fang," Hagrid said, indicating the dog.</p>
<p>The five of them set off into the woods.</p>
<p>"What could be killing unicorns?" Draco said after they'd walked
for a few minutes. Draco knew a bit about Dark creatures, but he
couldn't remember anything that was said to prey on unicorns. "What
sort of creature does that, does anyone know?"</p>
<p>"Werewolves!" said Tracey.</p>
<p>"Miss Davis?" Draco said, and when she looked at him, he
silently pointed a finger up at the moon. It was waxing gibbous,
but not yet full.</p>
<p>"Oh, right," said Tracey.</p>
<p>"No weres in the Forest," said Hagrid. "They're plain wizards
most o' the time, 'member. Couldn't be wolves either, they're not
near fast enough ter catch a unicorn. Powerful magical creatures,
unicorns are, I never knew one ter be hurt before."</p>
<p>Draco listened to this, thinking about the puzzle almost despite
himself. "Then what <em>is</em> fast enough to catch a
unicorn?"</p>
<p>"Wouldn't 'ave been a matter of speed," Hagrid said, giving
Draco an indecipherable glance. "Ere's no end ter the ways that
creatures hunt. Poison, darkness, traps. Imps as can't be seen or
heard or remembered, even while they're eatin' yer face. Always
summat new an' wonderful to learn."</p>
<p>A cloud passed over the moon, casting the forest into shadow lit
only by the glow of Hagrid's umbrella.</p>
<p>"Meself," Hagrid continued, "I think we might 'ave a Parisian
hydra on our 'ands. They're no threat to a wizard, yeh've just got
to keep holdin' 'em off long enough, and there's no way yeh can
lose. I mean literally no way yeh can lose so long's yeh keep
fightin'. Trouble is, against a Parisian hydra, most creatures give
up long before. Takes a while to cut down all the heads, yeh
see."</p>
<p>"Bah," said the foreign boy. "In Durmstrang we learn to fight
Buchholz hydra. Unimaginably more tedious to fight! I mean
literally, cannot imagine. First-years not believe us when we tell
them winning is possible! Instructor must give second order,
iterate until they comprehend."</p>
<p>They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the
Forest, until the path became almost impossible to follow because
the trees were so thick.</p>
<p>Then Draco saw it, thick splashes on the roots of trees,
gleaming a brighter color beneath the moonlight. "Is that -"</p>
<p>"Unicorn's blood," Hagrid said. The huge man's voice was
sad.</p>
<p>In a clearing ahead, visible through the tangled branches of a
great oak, they saw the fallen creature, splayed beautiful and sad
upon the ground, the dirt around her shining moon-silver with
pooled blood. The unicorn was not white, but pale blue, or
appearing so beneath the moon and night sky. Her slender legs stuck
out at odd angles, obviously broken, and her mane spread across the
dark leaves, green-black but with a sheen like pearls. On her flank
was a small white shape like a starburst, a center surrounded by
eight straight rays. Half her side had been ripped away, the edges
ragged like the marks of teeth, bones and inner organs exposed.</p>
<p>A strange choking sensation rose in Draco's throat.</p>
<p>"That's 'er," Hagrid said, his sad whisper as loud as a normal
man's voice. "Just where I found 'er this mornin', dead as a dead
doorknob. She is - was - the first unicorn I e'er met in these
woods. I called 'er Alicorn, not that it matters ter 'er any more,
I s'pose."</p>
<p>"You named a unicorn Alicorn," said the older girl. Her voice
was a bit dry.</p>
<p>"But she doesn't have wings," Tracey said.</p>
<p>"An alicorn's a unicorn's horn," Hagrid said, now louder. "Don't
know where yeh all started thinking it meant a unicorn with wings,
'ere's no such thing I ever heard. It's just like naming a dog
Fang," indicating the huge wolf-like dog that barely came to his
knees. "What'd you have called 'er? Hannah, or some such? I gave
'er a name as would've meant summat ter <em>'er.</em> Common
courtesy, I call it."</p>
<p>Nobody said anything to this, and after a further moment, the
huge man gave a sharp nod. "We'll start our search from 'ere, the
last place it struck. We're gonna split inter two parties an'
follow the trail in diff'rent directions. Yeh two, Walt and Yuliy -
yeh'll go that way, and take Fang. There's nothin' that lives in
the Forest that'll hurt yeh if yer with Fang. Send up green sparks
if yeh find summat interestin', an' send up red sparks if anyone
gets in trouble. Davis, Malfoy, with me."</p>
<p>The Forest was black and silent. Rubeus Hagrid had dimmed the
light of his umbrella after they'd set out, so that Draco and
Tracey had to steer themselves by the light of the moon, not
without occasional trips and falls. They walked past a mossy
tree-stump, the sound of running water speaking of a stream
somewhere close by. Now and then a ray of moonlight through the
branches above lit a spot of silver blue blood on the fallen
leaves; they were following the trail of blood, toward where the
creature must have first struck the unicorn.</p>
<p>"There's rumors about yeh," Hagrid said in a low voice after
they'd walked for a while.</p>
<p>"Well, they're all true," Tracey said. <em>"All</em> of
them."</p>
<p>"Not yeh," Hagrid said. "Did yeh really testify under
Veritaserum that yeh tried to help Miss Granger, three times it
was?"</p>
<p>Draco weighed his words for a while, and finally said, "Yes." It
wouldn't have done to appear too eager to claim credit.</p>
<p>The huge man shook his head, his great feet still stomping
silently through the woods. "I'm surprised, teh be honest. And yeh
too, Davis, tryin' to put the halls in order. Are yeh sure the
Sorting Hat put yeh in the right place? There's not a single witch
or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin, so it's always been
said."</p>
<p>"That's not true," Tracey said. "What about Xiaonan Tong the
Black Raven, Spencer of the Hill, and Mister Kayvon?"</p>
<p>"Who?" said Hagrid.</p>
<p>"Just some of the best Dark Wizards from the last two
centuries," Tracey said. "They're probably <em>the</em> best from
Hogwarts who weren't from Slytherin." Her voice fell, lost its
enthusiasm. "Miss Granger always told me I should read up on
anything I -"</p>
<p><em>"Anyway,"</em> Draco said quickly, "that's not really
relevant, Mr. Hagrid. Even if -" Draco worked it around in his
head, trying to translate the difference between <em>probability of
Slytherin given Dark</em> and <em>probability of Dark given
Slytherin</em> into nonscientific language. "Even if most Dark
Wizards are from Slytherin, very few Slytherins are Dark Wizards.
There aren't all that many Dark Wizards, so not all Slytherins can
be one." Or as Father had said, while any Malfoy should certainly
know much of the secret lore, the more... <em>costly</em> rituals
were better left to useful fools like Amycus Carrow.</p>
<p>"So yeh're saying," Hagrid said, "that most Dark Wizards are
Slytherins... but..."</p>
<p>"But most Slytherins are not Dark Wizards," Draco said. He had a
weary feeling they'd be at this a while, but like fighting a hydra,
the important thing was to not give up.</p>
<p>"I never thought of it that way," the huge man said, sounding
awestruck. "But, well, if yeh're not all a house of snakes, then
why - <em>get behind that tree!</em> "</p>
<p>Hagrid seized Draco and Tracey and hoisted them off the path
behind a towering oak. He pulled out a bolt and fitted it into his
crossbow, raising it, ready to fire. The three of them listened.
Something was slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a
cloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was squinting up the dark
path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded away.</p>
<p>"I knew it," Hagrid murmured. "There's summat in here that
shouldn' be."</p>
<p>They went after where the rustling sound had come from, with
Hagrid in the lead and Tracey and Draco both gripping their wands
at the ready, but they found nothing, despite searching in a
widening circle with their ears straining for the faintest
sound.</p>
<p>They walked on through the dense, dark trees. Draco kept looking
over his shoulder, a feeling nagging at him that they were being
watched. They had just passed a bend in the path when Tracey yelled
and pointed.</p>
<p>In the distance, a shower of red sparks lit the air.</p>
<p>"You two wait here!" Hagrid shouted. "Stay where yeh are, I'll
come back for yeh!"</p>
<p>Before Draco could say a word, Hagrid spun and crashed away
through the undergrowth.</p>
<p>Draco and Tracey stood looking at each other, until they heard
nothing but the rustling of leaves around them. Tracey looked
scared, but trying to hide it. Draco was feeling more annoyed than
anything else. Apparently Rubeus Hagrid, when he had formed his
plans for tonight, had not spent even five seconds visualizing the
consequences if something actually went wrong.</p>
<p>"Now what?" said Tracey, her voice a little high.</p>
<p>"We wait for Mr. Hagrid to come back."</p>
<p>The minutes dragged by. Draco's ears seemed sharper than usual,
picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig. Tracey kept
looking up at the moon, as though to reassure herself that it
wasn't full yet.</p>
<p>"I'm -" Tracey whispered. "I'm getting a little nervous, Mr.
Malfoy."</p>
<p>Draco thought about it a bit. To be honest, there <em>was</em>
something... well, it wasn't that he was a coward, or even that he
was scared. But there had been a murder at Hogwarts and if he'd
been watching himself in a play, having just been abandoned in the
Forbidden Forest by a half-giant, he would currently feel like
yelling at the boy on stage that he should...</p>
<p>Draco reached into his robes, and took out a mirror. Tapping the
surface showed a man in red robes, who frowned almost
immediately.</p>
<p>"Auror Captain Eneasz Brodski," the man said clearly, causing
Tracey to start with the loudness in the quiet forest. "What is it,
Draco Malfoy?"</p>
<p>"Put me on ten-minute check-in," Draco said. He'd decided not to
complain directly about his detention. He did <em>not</em> want to
look like a spoiled brat. "If I don't respond, come get me. I'm in
the Forbidden Forest."</p>
<p>Inside the mirror, the Auror's brows rose. "What are you doing
in the Forbidden Forest, Mr. Malfoy?"</p>
<p>"Looking for the unicorn-eater with Mr. Hagrid," Draco said, and
tapped the mirror off, putting it back in his robes before the
Auror could ask anything about detentions or say anything about
serving it out without complaining.</p>
<p>Tracey's head turned toward him, though it was a little too dim
to read her expression. "Um, thanks," she whispered.</p>
<p>The few leaves which had emerged on their branches rustled as
another, colder breeze blew through the forest.</p>
<p>Tracey's voice was a little louder when she spoke again. "You
didn't have to -" she said, now sounding a little shy.</p>
<p>"Don't mention it, Miss Davis."</p>
<p>The dark silhouette of Tracey put her hand to her cheek, as
though to conceal a blush that wasn't visible anyway. "I mean, not
for <em>me</em> -"</p>
<p>"No, really," Draco said. "Don't mention it. At all." He would
have threatened to take out the mirror and order Captain Brodski
not to rescue <em>her,</em> but he was afraid she would consider
that flirting.</p>
<p>Tracey's silhouetted head turned from him, looked away. Finally
she said, in a smaller voice, "It's too soon, isn't it -"</p>
<p>A high scream echoed through the woods, a not-quite-human sound,
the scream of something like a horse; and Tracey shrieked and
ran.</p>
<p><em>"No, you numbskull!</em> " yelled Draco, plunging after her.
The sound had been so eerie that Draco wasn't certain where it came
from - but he thought that Tracey Davis might, in fact, be running
straight toward the source of that eerie scream.</p>
<p>Brambles whipped at Draco's eyes, he had to keep one hand in
front of his face to shield them, trying not to lose track of
Tracey because it seemed obvious that, if this was a play, and they
got separated, <em>one</em> of them was going to die. Draco thought
of the mirror secured within his robes but he somehow knew that if
he tried to take it out one-handed while running, the mirror would
inevitably fall and be lost -</p>
<p>Ahead of them, Tracey had stopped, and Draco felt relieved for
an instant, before he saw.</p>
<p>Another unicorn lay on the ground, surrounded by a slowly
widening pool of silver blood, the edge of the blood creeping
across the ground like spilled mercury. Her coat was purple, like
the color of the night sky, her horn exactly the same twilight
color as her skin, her visible flank marked by a pink star-blotch
surrounded by white patches. The sight tore at Draco's heart, even
more than the other unicorn because this one's eyes were staring
glassily right at him, and because there was a -</p>
<p>- blurring, twisting form -</p>
<p>- feeding on an open wound on the unicorn's side, like it was
drinking from it -</p>
<p>- Draco couldn't understand, somehow couldn't recognize what he
was seeing -</p>
<p>- <em>it was looking at them.</em></p>
<p>The blurring, seething, unrecognizable darkness seemed to turn
to regard them. A hiss came from it, like the hiss of the deadliest
snake which ever had existed, something more dangerous by far than
any Blue Krait.</p>
<p>Then it bent back over the wound in the unicorn, and continued
to drink.</p>
<p>The mirror was in Draco's hand, and it remained lifeless as his
finger mechanically tapped at the surface, over and over.</p>
<p>Tracey was holding her wand now, saying things like "Prismatis"
and "Stupefy" but nothing was happening.</p>
<p>Then the seething outline rose up, like a man rising to his feet
only not so; and it seemed to scuttle forward, moving with a
strange half-jump across the dying unicorn's legs, approaching the
two of them.</p>
<p>Tracey tugged at his sleeve and then turned to run, run from
something that could hunt down unicorns. Before she could take
three steps there came another terrible hiss, burning his ears, and
Tracey fell to the ground and did not move.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the back of his mind, Draco knew that he was about
to die. Even if the Auror checked his mirror this very instant,
there was no way anyone could get here fast enough. There was no
<em>time.</em></p>
<p>Running hadn't worked.</p>
<p>Magic hadn't worked.</p>
<p>The seething outline came closer, while Draco tried, in his last
moments, to solve the riddle.</p>
<p>Then a blazing silver ball of light plunged out of the night sky
and hung there, illuminating the forest as bright as daylight, and
the seething outline leapt backwards, as though in horror of the
light.</p>
<p>Four broomsticks plunged out of the sky, three Aurors with
bright multicolored shields and Harry Potter holding his wand
aloft, seated behind Professor McGonagall within a larger
shield.</p>
<p>"Get out of here!" roared Professor McGonagall -</p>
<p><em>- an instant before the seething thing gave forth another
terrible hiss, and all the shielding spells winked out. The three
Aurors and Professor McGonagall fell off their broomsticks and
dropped heavily to the forest floor, lying motionless.</em></p>
<p><em>Draco couldn't breathe, the most intense fear he'd ever felt
in his life gripping all through his chest, sending tendrils around
his heart.</em></p>
<p><em>Harry Potter, who had remained untouched, silently guided
his broomstick toward the ground -</em></p>
<p><em>- and then leapt off to stand between Draco and the seething
outline, interposing himself like a living shield.</em></p>
<p><em>"Run!" said Harry Potter, turning his head half-back to look
at Draco. The silver moonlight gleamed on his face. "Run, Draco!
I'll hold it off!"</em></p>
<p><em>"You can't fight that thing alone!" Draco cried aloud. A
nausea was in his stomach, a churning sensation that, looking back
in memory, seemed both like and unlike a sense of guilt, as though
it had the sensations but not quite all of the emotion.</em></p>
<p><em>"I must," Harry Potter said grimly. "Go!"</em></p>
<p><em>"Harry, I - I'm sorry, for everything - I" Though later,
looking back, Draco couldn't quite remember what he'd meant to
apologize for, maybe it'd been that he was planning to overthow
Harry's conspiracy, all that time ago.</em></p>
<p><em>The seething figure, now seeming blacker and more terrible,
rose up into the air, hovering off the ground.</em></p>
<p><em>"GO!" shouted Harry.</em></p>
<p><em>Draco turned and fled headlong into the woods,with the
branches whipping at his face. Behind him, Draco heard another
terrible hiss, and Harry's voice rising, crying something that
Draco couldn't make out from the distance; Draco turned his head
for only an instant to look back, and in that moment ran into
something, hitting his head HARD, and blacked out.</em></p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry held a tight grip on his wand, a Prismatic Sphere glowing
around him. He stared levelly at the seething, blurring form in
front of him, and said, "What on Earth are you doing?"</p>
<p>The seething blurs resolved, reformed, relaxed back into a
hooded form. Whatever concealment had been at work - a device
rather than a Charm, Harry guessed, since the magic had been able
to affect him - had prevented his mind from recognizing the shape
or even that the shape was human. But it hadn't prevented Harry
from recognizing the sharp sense of doom.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell stood straight with silver blood all down the
front of his enshrouding black cloak, and gave a sigh, looking at
the fallen forms of three Aurors, Tracey Davis, Draco Malfoy, and
Professor McGonagall. "I had honestly thought," Professor Quirrell
murmured, "that I jammed that mirror without alarm. What were two
first-year Slytherins doing alone in the Forbidden Forest? Mr.
Malfoy has more sense than this... What a fiasco."</p>
<p>Harry didn't answer. The sense of doom was as strong as Harry
could ever remember feeling it, a feeling of power in the air so
great that it was almost tangible. Some part of him was still
viscerally shocked at how fast the shields surrounding the Aurors
had been torn apart. He almost hadn't been able to <em>see</em> the
successive lashes of color which had torn away the shields like
tissue paper. It made the duel Professor Quirrell had fought
against the Auror in Azkaban look like a mockery, a child's game -
though Professor Quirrell had claimed, then, that if he'd fought
for real the Auror would have been dead in seconds; and Harry knew
now that this was also true.</p>
<p>Just how high did the power ladder go?</p>
<p>"I take it," Harry said, managing to keep his voice steady,
"that your eating unicorns has something to do with why you'll get
fired from the Defense Professor position. I don't suppose you'd
care to explain in considerable detail?"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell looked at him. The almost tangible sense of
power in the air seemed to diminish, drawing back into the Defense
Professor. "I shall indeed explain myself," the Defense Professor
said. "I need to cast a few Memory Charms first, and then we may go
off and discuss it, for it would not be wise for me to stay. You
will return to this time later, as I know."</p>
<p>Harry willed himself to be able to see through the Cloak he had
mastered; and knew that another Harry stood beside him, hidden by
his own Deathly Hallow. Harry then told his Cloak to hide himself
from himself once more, and it did; being able to perceive your
future self meant having to match the memory later.</p>
<p>Harry's own voice said, then, sounding strange in
present-Harry's ears, "He has a surprisingly good explanation."</p>
<p>Present-Harry remembered the words as best he could. Nothing
more was said between them.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell walked to Draco's form, and chanted the spell
of the False Memory Charm. The Defense Professor stood there for
perhaps a minute, seemingly lost to the world.</p>
<p>Harry had been studying Obliviations, these last couple of weeks
- though he couldn't have helped cast the spells, unless he was
willing to exhaust himself almost completely, and for some reason
they wanted an Auror to lose every single life memory involving the
color blue. But Harry had some idea, now, of the concentration
which the far more difficult False Memory Charm entailed. You had
to try to live the other person's entire life inside your own head,
at least if you wanted to create the False Memories with less than
a sixteen-to-one slowdown as you separately crafted sixteen major
tracks of memory. It might have been quiet, there might have been
no outward sign; but Harry knew something of the difficulties now,
and he knew to be impressed.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell finished, and moved on to Tracey Davis, then
the three Aurors, and finally Professor McGonagall. Harry waited,
but future-Harry made no protest. It was possible that even
Professor McGonagall, if she'd been awake, wouldn't have protested.
It was not yet the Ides of May, and apparently there would be a
surprisingly good explanation.</p>
<p>With a gesture, Draco's stunned body was lifted, and sent a
short distance into the woods, before being carefully deposited on
the ground. Then a final gesture from Professor Quirrell ripped a
huge chunk out of the unicorn's side, leaving behind ragged edges;
the raw meat hovered in the air, then wavered in Vanishment and was
gone.</p>
<p>"Done," Professor Quirrell said. "I must depart this place now,
Mr. Potter. Come with me, and remain here."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell strode away, and Harry followed and remained
behind.</p>
<p>They walked through the woods in silence for a time, before
Harry heard faint voices in the distance. The next set of Aurors,
presumably, after the first set had fallen out of contact. What his
future self was saying, Harry didn't know.</p>
<p>"They won't detect us, nor hear our speech," said Professor
Quirrell. The sense of power and doom around the Defense Professor
was still strong. The man seated himself on a tree stump, one where
the light of the almost-full moon fell full on him. "I should first
say that when you speak to the Aurors, in the future, you should
tell them that you frightened away the seething dark, the same as
you did that Dementor. It is what Mr. Malfoy will remember seeing."
Professor Quirrell gave a small sigh. "It may cause some alarm, if
they conclude that some horror kin to Dementors, and strong enough
to break the Aurors' shields, is loose in the Forbidden Forest. But
I could not think of what else to do. If the forest is
better-guarded after this - but with any luck I have already
consumed what I need. Would you mind telling me how you arrived so
quickly? How did you know Mr. Malfoy was in trouble?"</p>
<p>After Captain Brodski had learned that Draco Malfoy was in the
Forbidden Forest, seemingly in the company of Rubeus Hagrid,
Brodski had begun inquiring to find out who had authorized this,
and had still been unable to find out when Draco Malfoy had missed
check-in. Despite Harry's protests, the Auror Captain, who was
authorized to know about Time-Turners, had refused to allow
deployment to before the time of the missed check-in; there were
standard procedures involving Time. But Brodski had given Harry
written orders allowing him to go back and deploy an Auror trio to
arrive one second after the missed check-in time. There had been a
Patronus Charm to locate Draco, which Harry had successfully willed
to take the form of a ball of pure silver light, and the flight of
Aurors had arrived on time to the second.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid I couldn't say," Harry replied evenly. Professor
Quirrell was still a major suspect, and it was good for him not to
know the details. "Now why are you eating unicorns?"</p>
<p>"Ah," Professor Quirrell said. "As to that…" The man hesitated.
"I was drinking the blood of unicorns, not eating them. The missing
flesh, the ragged marks upon the body - those were to obscure the
case, to make it seem like some other predator. The use of
unicorn's blood is too well-known."</p>
<p>"I don't know it," Harry said.</p>
<p>"I know you do not," the Defense Professor said sharply. "Or you
would not be pestering me about it. The power of unicorn's blood is
to preserve your life for a time, even if you are on the very verge
of death."</p>
<p>There was a stretch of time when Harry's brain claimed to be
refusing to process the words, which was of course a lie, because
you couldn't know the meaning you weren't allowed to process,
without having already processed it.</p>
<p>A strange sense of blankness overtook Harry, an absence of
reaction, maybe this was what other people felt like when someone
went off-script, and they couldn't say or think of anything to
do.</p>
<p>Of course Professor Quirrell was dying, not just occasionally
ill.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell had known he was dying. He'd volunteered to
take the Defense Professor position at Hogwarts, after all.</p>
<p>Of course he'd been getting worse the whole school year. Of
course illnesses which kept getting worse had a predictable
destination at their end.</p>
<p>Harry's brain had surely known already, somewhere in the safe
back of his mind where he could refuse to process things he'd
already processed.</p>
<p>Of course that was why Professor Quirrell wouldn't be able to
teach Battle Magic next year. Professor McGonagall wouldn't even
have to fire him. He would just be -</p>
<p>- dead.</p>
<p>"No," Harry said, his voice a little shaky. "There has to be a
way -"</p>
<p>"I am not stupid nor particularly eager to die. I have already
looked. I had to go this far simply to last out my lesson plans,
having less time than I had thought, and -" The head of the dark
moonlit figure turned away. "I think I do not want to hear about
it, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>Harry's breath hitched. Too many emotions were bubbling up in
him at once. After denial came anger, according to a ritual someone
had just made up. And yet it seemed surprisingly appropriate.</p>
<p>"And why -" Harry's breath hitched again. "Why isn't unicorn's
blood standard in healer's kits, then? To keep someone alive, even
if they're on the very verge of dying from their legs being
eaten?"</p>
<p>"Because there are permanent side effects," Professor Quirrell
said quietly.</p>
<p>"Side effects? <em>Side effects?</em> What kind of side effect
is medically worse than <em>DEATH?</em> " Harry's voice rose on the
last word until he was shouting.</p>
<p>"Not everyone thinks the same way we do, Mr. Potter. Though, to
be fair, the blood must come from a live unicorn and the unicorn
must die in the drinking. Would I be here otherwise?"</p>
<p>Harry turned, stared at the surrounding trees. "Have a herd of
unicorns at St. Mungos. Floo the patients there, or use
portkeys."</p>
<p>"Yes, that would work."</p>
<p>Harry's face tightened, the only outward sign behind his
trembling hands of everything that was welling up inside him. He
needed to scream, needed some outlet, needed <em>something</em> he
couldn't name and finally Harry leveled his wand at a tree and
shouted <em>"Diffindo!</em> "</p>
<p>There was a sharp tearing sound, and a cut appeared across the
wood.</p>
<p><em>"Diffindo!"</em></p>
<p>Another cut. Harry had learned the Charm only ten days
previously, after he'd started getting serious about self-defense.
It was theoretically a second-year Charm, but the anger pouring
through him seemed to know no bounds, he knew enough now not to
exhaust himself and he still had power yet.</p>
<p><em>"Diffindo!</em> " Harry had aimed at a branch this time, and
it plummeted to the ground with a sound of twigs and leaves.</p>
<p>There didn't seem to be any tears inside him, only pressure with
no outlet.</p>
<p>"I shall leave you to it," Professor Quirrell said quietly. The
Defense Professor rose from his tree stump, the unicorn's blood
still moonlit on the black cloak he wore, and drew his hood back
over his head.</p>
</div>
<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 105: The Truth, Pt 2<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p><em>Tom Riddle.</em></p>
<p>The words seemed to echo inside Harry's head, sparking
resonances that as quickly died away, broken patterns trying to
complete themselves and failing.</p>
<p><em>Tom Riddle is a</em></p>
<p><em>Tom Riddle was the</em></p>
<p><em>Riddle</em></p>
<p>There were other priorities occupying Harry's attention.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was pointing a gun at him.</p>
<p>And for some reason Lord Voldemort hadn't fired it yet.</p>
<p>Harry's voice came out in more of a croak. "What is it that you
want from me?"</p>
<p>"Your death," said Professor Quirrell, "is clearly not what I am
about to say, since I have had plenty of time to kill you if I
wished. The fateful battle between Lord Voldemort and the
Boy-Who-Lived is a figment of Dumbledore's imagination. I know
where to find your family's house in Oxford, and I am familiar with
the concept of sniper rifles. You would have died before you ever
touched a wand. I hope this is clear to you, Tom?"</p>
<p>"Crystal," Harry whispered. His body was still shaking, running
programs more suited to fleeing a tiger than casting delicate
spells or <em>thinking.</em> But Harry could think of one thing the
person pointing a gun at him obviously wanted him to do, a question
that person was waiting for him to ask, and Harry did so. "Why are
you calling me Tom?"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell regarded him steadily. "Why <em>am</em> I
calling you Tom? Answer. Your intellect is not everything I hoped
for, but it should suffice for this."</p>
<p>Harry's mouth seemed to know the answer before his brain could
manage to focus on the question. "Tom Riddle is your name. Our
name. That's who Lord Voldemort is, or was, or - something."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell nodded. "Better. You have already vanquished
the Dark Lord, the one and only time that you will ever do so. I
have already destroyed all but a remnant of Harry Potter,
eliminating the difference between our spirits and enabling us to
reside in the same world. Now that it is clear to you that the
battle between us is a lie, you might act sensibly to advance your
own interests. Or you might not." The gun jabbed slightly forward,
causing prickles of sweat to appear on Harry's forehead. "Drop your
wand. <em>Now</em>."</p>
<p>Harry dropped it.</p>
<p>"Step away from the wand," said Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>Harry obeyed.</p>
<p>"Reach toward your neck," said Professor Quirrell, "and remove
your Time-Turner, touching it by the chain only. Place the
Time-Turner on the ground, then step away from it as well."</p>
<p>This also Harry did. Even in his state of shock, his mind still
looked for a way to spin the Time-Turner in the process, a sudden
move that would win; but Harry knew that Professor Quirrell would
already be imagining himself in Harry's position, looking for the
same possible opportunities.</p>
<p>"Remove your pouch and place it also on the ground, then step
away."</p>
<p>Harry did this.</p>
<p>"Very good," said the Defense Professor. "Now. It is time for me
to obtain the Philosopher's Stone. I mean to bring along these four
first-years here, suitably Obliviated of their most recent memories
so that they still recall their original purpose. Snape I shall
control and set to guard this door. After this day's work is done,
I intend to kill Snape for the betrayals he has offered my other
identity. The three heir-children I shall take with me afterwards,
to shape their future loyalties. And know this, I have taken
hostages. I have already set in motion a spell that will kill
hundreds of Hogwarts students, including many you called friends. I
can stop that spell using the Stone, if I obtain it successfully.
If I am interrupted before then, or if I choose not to stop the
spell, hundreds of students will die." Professor Quirrell's voice
was still mild. "Do you yet perceive any interests you have at
stake, boy? I would smile to hear you say 'no', but that is too
much to hope."</p>
<p>"I'd like," Harry managed to say, through the horror, and the
heartbreak, and the knives slicing away at an emotional connection
that hurt like living flesh as it was cut, "for you not to do those
things, Professor." <em>Why, Professor Quirrell, why, why did it
have to turn out like this, I don't, I don't, I don't want this to
be happening...</em></p>
<p>"Very well," Professor Quirrell said. "I grant you permission to
offer me something I want." The gun gestured invitingly. "That is a
rare privilege, child. Lord Voldemort does not usually negotiate
for what he wants."</p>
<p>Some part of Harry's mind scrabbled frantically, looking for
something, anything that might be of more value to Lord Voldemort
or Professor Quirrell than child hostages or Severus's death.</p>
<p>Another part of him, the part that had never stopped thinking,
already knew his answer.</p>
<p>"You already have an idea for what you want from me," Harry
said, through the sickness and the bleeding wounds in his soul.
"What is it?"</p>
<p>"Your help in obtaining the Philosopher's Stone."</p>
<p>Harry swallowed. He couldn't stop his eyes from going to the
gun, then back up at Professor Quirrell's face.</p>
<p>He was aware that the hero in a storybook was supposed to say
'No', but now that he was actually in a situation like this, saying
'No' didn't seem to make sense.</p>
<p>"I am disappointed that you need to think about this," said
Professor Quirrell. "It is straightforward that you should obey me
for now, since I hold every advantage over you. I have taught you
better than this; in this situation you should certainly pretend to
lose. You can expect to gain nothing by resisting, except pain. You
should have calculated that it was better to answer sooner, and not
earn my distrust." Professor Quirrell's eyes studied him curiously.
"Perhaps Dumbledore has filled your ears with nonsense about noble
defiance? I find such morals amusing, since they are so easy to
manipulate. I assure you that I can make defiance seem morally
worse, and you would be well advised to submit before I demonstrate
how." The gun stayed pointed at Harry; but with a wave of Professor
Quirrell's other hand, Tracey Davis rose up into the air, spun
lazily, her limbs stretched out spreadeagle -</p>
<p>- then, even as new adrenaline hammered at Harry's heart, Tracey
floated back down again.</p>
<p>"Choose," said Professor Quirrell. "This begins to try my
patience."</p>
<p><em>I should have spoken just then, before he might've ripped
off Tracey's legs, no, I shouldn't have, the Headmaster said I
mustn't show Lord Voldemort that I'll do things if he threatens my
friends because that will just make him threaten more of them -
only what he said before isn't a</em> threat <em>it's just the sort
of thing Lord Voldemort</em> does -</p>
<p>Harry took a deep breath, several of them. Whatever part of him
kept on running on full automatic was screaming at the remainder of
his mind that it <em>could not afford to stay in shock.</em> Shocks
were of finite duration, neurons kept firing regardless, the only
reason Harry's mind would shut down while his brain kept running
was if Harry's self-model <em>believed</em> his mind would shut
down -</p>
<p>"I don't mean to try your patience," Harry said. His voice was
cracking. That was good. Sounding like he was still in shock meant
that Lord Voldemort might give him more time. "But if Lord
Voldemort had a reputation for keeping his bargains, I don't know
about it."</p>
<p>"An obvious concern," Professor Quirrell said. "There is a
simple answer, and I would have enforced it upon you in any case.
<em>Ssnakes can't lie</em>. And since I have a tremendous distaste
for stupidity, I suggest you do not say anything like 'What do you
mean?' You are smarter than that, and I do not have time for such
conversations as ordinary people inflict on one another."</p>
<p>Harry swallowed. Snakes can't lie. "<em>Two pluss two equalss
four.</em>" Harry had tried to say that two plus two equalled
three, and the word <em>four</em> had slipped out instead.</p>
<p>"Good. When Salazar Slytherin invoked the Parselmouth curse upon
himself and all his children, his true plan was to ensure his
descendants could trust one another's words, whatever plots they
wove against outsiders." Professor Quirrell had adopted his
lecturing pose from Battle Magic, like someone putting on a
well-worn mask, but the gun remained pointed in his hand.
"Occlumency cannot fool the Parselmouth curse as it can fool
Veritaserum, and you may put that to the trial also. Now listen
well. <em>Come with me, promisse your besst aid in getting Sstone,
and I sshall leave thesse children behind unharmed. Hosstagess are
real, hundredss of sstudentss die tonight unlesss I sstop eventss
already sset in motion. Will sspare hosstagess if I obtain Sstone
ssuccessfully.</em> And mark also this, mark it well: <em>I cannot
be truly sslain by any means known to me, and lossing Sstone will
not sstop me from returning, nor sspare you or yourss my
wrath.</em> Any impetuous act you are contemplating cannot win the
game for you, boy. I do credit your ability to annoy me, and
suggest you avoid doing so."</p>
<p>"You said," Harry's voice was strange in his own ears, "that the
Philosopher's Stone had different powers from what legend said. You
said that to me in Parseltongue. Tell me what the Stone really
does, before I agree to help you get it." If it was something along
the lines of gaining total power over the universe, then
<em>nothing</em> was worth an incrementally greater chance of Lord
Voldemort getting the Stone.</p>
<p>"Ah," said Professor Quirrell, and smiled. "You are thinking.
That is better, and as a reward I shall offer you a further
incentive for cooperation. Eternal life and youth, the creation of
gold and silver. Suppose these are true benefits of holding the
Stone. Tell me, boy. What is the Stone's power?"</p>
<p>It might have been the adrenaline still in him, being actually
useful for his brain for once. It might have been the power of
being told that an answer existed, and that the evidence wasn't a
lie. "It can make Transfigurations permanent."</p>
<p>Then Harry stopped, as he heard what his own mouth had just
said.</p>
<p>"Correct," said Professor Quirrell. "Thus, whoever holds the
Philosopher's Stone is able to perform human Transfiguration."</p>
<p>Harry's torn mind was knocked about yet again, as he realized
what further incentive would be offered him.</p>
<p>"You stole Miss Granger's remains and Transfigured them into
some innocuous-appearing target," said Professor Quirrell. "A
Transfigured target that you must keep somewhere about your own
person, in order to sustain the Transfiguration. Ah, I see your
eyes going to that ring upon your hand, but of course Miss Granger
would not be the little jewel set into the ring, would it? That
would be too obvious. No, I expect you Transfigured Granger's
remains into the ring itself, letting the aura of the Transfigured
jewel mask the magic in the Transfigured ring."</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said, forcing out the word. It was a lie, for once,
and Harry's glance had been deliberate. Harry had expected someone
to challenge him on the steel ring, he'd tried to provoke that
challenge so he could prove to be innocent yet again, though nobody
had taken him up on it - maybe Dumbledore had just sensed that the
steel by itself wasn't magical.</p>
<p>"Fine and good," said Professor Quirrell. "Now come with me,
help me to obtain the Stone, and I will resurrect Hermione Granger
on your behalf. Her death has had unfortunate effects on you, and I
would not mind undoing them. That, as I understand you, is your
greatest desire. I have done you many kindnesses, and I would not
mind doing you this one more." A blank-eyed Professor Sprout had
now risen from the ground and was pointing her own wand at Harry.
"<em>Help me obtain Sstone of Transsfiguration, and I sshall try my
hardesst to ressurrect your girl-child friend to true and lassting
life. That ssaid, boy, I am sswiftly running out of patience with
you, and you sshall not like what comess next.</em>" This last line
was hissed out in a voice that conveyed the impression of a snake
rearing its head to strike.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Even then.</p>
<p>Even then, with all the world upturned, with shock after shock,
even then Harry's brain did not stop being a brain, or completing
the patterns its circuits had been wired to complete.</p>
<p>Harry knew that this was too good an offer to make to someone at
whom you were pointing a gun.</p>
<p>Unless you <em>desperately</em> needed their help to get the
Philosopher's Stone out of the magic mirror.</p>
<p>And there wasn't any time left to plan, only the thought that,
if Professor Quirrell really was going this far to get his help -
what Harry <em>wanted</em> was to demand Professor Quirrell promise
not to kill anyone in the future in exchange for his help now, but
Harry had a strong sense that Professor Quirrell would reply 'Don't
be ridiculous' and there wasn't time for ordinary conversation
Harry had to guess the highest safe request in advance -</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's eyes narrowed, his lips parted -</p>
<p>"If I help you," Harry's mouth said, "I want your promise that
you aren't planning to turn on me when this is over. I want you to
not kill Professor Snape or anyone else in Hogwarts for at least a
week. And I want answers, the truth about everything that's been
going on this whole time, everything you know about my nature."</p>
<p>The pale blue eyes regarded him dispassionately.</p>
<p><em>I really think we could have thought of something better to
ask for than that,</em> said Harry's Slytherin side. <em>But I
suppose we were legitimately out of time, and whatever we need to
do next, answers will help.</em></p>
<p>Harry wasn't listening to that voice right now. Cold chills were
still going down his spine from hearing the words that had just
come out of his lips, addressed to the man with the gun.</p>
<p>"That is your condition for helping me to obtain the Stone?"
said Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>Harry nodded, unable to form words.</p>
<p><em>"Agreed,</em>" hissed Professor Quirrell. "<em>Help me, and
you sshall have ansswerss to your quesstions, sso long ass they are
about passt eventss, and not my planss for the future. I do not
intend to raisse my hand or magic againsst you in future, sso long
ass you do not raisse your hand or magic againsst me. Sshall kill
none within sschool groundss for a week, unlesss I musst. Now
promisse that you will not attempt to warn againsst me or esscape.
Promisse to put forth your own besst efforts toward helping me to
obtain the Sstone. And your girl-child friend sshall be revived by
me, to true life and health; nor sshall me or mine ever sseek to
harm her.</em>" A twisted smile. "<em>Promisse, boy, and the
bargain will be sstruck."</em></p>
<p>"I promise," whispered Harry.</p>
<p><em>WHAT?</em> screamed other parts of his mind.</p>
<p><em>Um, he's still pointing a gun at us,</em> pointed out
Slytherin. <em>We don't actually have a choice, we're just getting
as much mileage out of this as possible.</em></p>
<p><em>You bastard,</em> said Hufflepuff. <em>Do you think this is
what Hermione would have wanted? This is Lord Voldemort we're
talking about, do we even know how many people he's killed, and
will kill?</em></p>
<p><em>I deny that we are compromising with Lord Voldemort for
Hermione's sake,</em> said Slytherin. <em>Since there is, in fact,
a gun and we can't otherwise stop him. Also, Mum and Dad would want
us to just go along and stay safe.</em></p>
<p>Professor Quirrell regarded him steadily. "Repeat the full
promise in Parseltongue, boy."</p>
<p>"<em>I sshall help you obtain the Sstone... I cannot promisse I
will usse my besst efforts, my heart will not be in it, I fear. I
intend to try. Sshall not do anything I think will annoy you to no
good end. Sshall call no help if I expect them to be killed by you
or for hosstagess to die. I'm ssorry, teacher, but it iss besst I
can do."</em> Harry's mind was settling, composing itself, as the
decision was made. He would stay with Professor Quirrell, go with
him to get the Stone, save the student hostages, and... and... and
Harry didn't know, except that he'd go on thinking.</p>
<p>"You actually are sorry about that?" Professor Quirrell looked
amused. "I suppose it shall have to do. Then keep two other things
in mind: <em>I have plan to sstop even sschoolmasster, if he
appearss before uss.</em> And also this: I will occasionally ask
you to say in Parseltongue whether you have betrayed me. <em>The
bargain is sstruck.</em>"</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>After that, Professor Sprout picked up Harry's wand, and wrapped
it in shimmering cloth; then she placed it on the floor, and again
pointed her wand at Harry. Only then did Professor Quirrell lower
his gun, which seemed to disappear into his hand, and pick up
Harry's wrapped wand, tucking it into his robes.</p>
<p>The True Cloak of Invisibility was removed from the sleeping
form of Lesath Lestrange, and Professor Quirrell took the Cloak, as
well as Harry's pouch and Time-Turner.</p>
<p>Then Professor Quirrell cast a mass Obliviation followed by the
mass version of the False Memory Charm, the one that just had the
subject fill in the blanks using their own suggestibility, on all
the students present. Afterwards Professor Sprout floated away the
sleeping children, now wearing an expression that seemed annoyed
and preoccupied, as if they'd been in some Herbology accident.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell then turned back to where the Potions Master
lay sprawled, bent over and placed his wand on Professor Snape's
forehead. <em>"Alienis nervus mobile lignum."</em></p>
<p>The Defense Professor stepped back, and began to move his left
fingers in the air as though manipulating a puppet on strings.</p>
<p>Professor Snape pushed himself up from the ground by smooth
motions, and stood once more before the corridor door.</p>
<p>"<em>Alohomora,</em>" Professor Quirrell said, pointing his wand
at the forbidden door. The Defense Professor looked rather amused.
"Would you do the honors, boy?"</p>
<p>Harry swallowed. He was once again having second thoughts, and
third thoughts.</p>
<p>It was strange how you could do something even while knowing it
was the wrong thing, not the selfish thing but the <em>wrong thing
to do</em> on some deeper level.</p>
<p>But the man behind him was holding the gun; it had once more
appeared in his hand at Harry's hesitation.</p>
<p>Harry laid his hand on the door-knocker, and took several deep
breaths, again composing his mind as best he could. Go through with
it, don't get shot, don't let the hostages die, be there to
optimize events, be there to watch for opportunities and stay
capable of taking them. It wasn't a good choice, but all the other
ones seemed worse.</p>
<p>Harry pushed open the forbidden door, and stepped through.</p>

</div>
<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 106: The Truth, Pt 3<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>After a single step into Dumbledore's forbidden chamber, Harry
shrieked and jumped back and collided with Professor Snape, sending
the two of them down in a heap.</p>
<p>Professor Snape picked himself up and resumed standing in front
of the door. His head tracked to look at Harry. "I am guarding this
door at the Headmaster's orders," said Professor Snape in his usual
sardonic tones. "Be off with you at once, or I shall deduct House
Points."</p>
<p>This was bone-chillingly creepy, but Harry's attention was
occupied by the gigantic three-headed dog which had lunged forward,
only to be stopped meters from Harry by the chains upon its three
collars.</p>
<p>"That - that - that - " Harry said.</p>
<p>"Yes," Professor Quirrell said from a ways behind him, "that is
indeed the usual occupant of that chamber, which is off-limits to
all students, especially first-years."</p>
<p><em>"That's not safe even by wizard standards!"</em> Within the
chamber, the enormous black beast gave a multi-voiced bellow,
flecks of white saliva flying from three fanged mouths.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell sighed. "It is enchanted not to eat students,
just spit them back out through the door. Now, boy, how would you
recommend that we deal with this dangerous creature?"</p>
<p>"Uh," Harry stuttered, trying to think over the continued
roaring of the chamber's guardian. "Uh. If it's like the Cerberus
from the Muggle legend of Orpheus and Eurydice, then we have to
sing it to sleep so we can pass -"</p>
<p>"<em>Avada Kedavra.</em>"</p>
<p>The three-headed beast fell over.</p>
<p>Harry looked back at Professor Quirrell, who was giving him a
look of extreme disappointment, as if to ask whether Harry had
attended any of his classes, ever.</p>
<p>"I sort of <em>assumed</em>," Harry said, still trying to catch
his breath, "that going through this challenge in any way except
the one used by first-years, might perhaps trigger an
<em>alarm</em>."</p>
<p>"That is a lie, boy, you simply did not remember your lessons
when you faced the occasion in true life. As for alarms, I have
spent months befuddling all the wards and tripsigns upon these
chambers."</p>
<p>"Then why did you send me in first, exactly?"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell just smiled. It looked significantly more
evil than usual.</p>
<p>"Never mind," Harry said, and walked slowly into the chamber,
his limbs still shaking.</p>
<p>The chamber was all of stone, illuminated by a pale blue light
that shone from arched nooks carved into the wall; as if the light
of a grey sky were passing through windows, though there were no
windows. At the far end of the chamber was a wooden trapdoor upon
the floor, with a single ring attached. In the middle of the
chamber lay a gigantic dead dog with three lifeless heads.</p>
<p>Harry turned toward one of the arched nooks and looked inside
it. There was nothing there but the sourceless blue glow, so he
walked over and looked in the next one, also scrutinizing the wall
as he passed.</p>
<p>"What," said Professor Quirrell, "are you doing?"</p>
<p>"Searching the room," Harry said. "There could be a clue, or an
inscription, or a key we'll need later, or something -"</p>
<p>"Are you serious, or are you deliberately trying to slow us
down? Answer in Parseltongue."</p>
<p>Harry looked back. "<em>Wass sseriouss,</em>" hissed Harry.
"<em>Would have done ssame if came by mysself.</em>"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell briefly massaged his forehead. "I confess,"
he said, "that your approach would serve you well in, say,
exploring the tomb of Amon-Set, so I will not quite call you an
idiot, but still. The false puzzle, the outer form of the
challenge, is a game meant for first-years. We simply go down
through the trapdoor."</p>
<p>Beneath the trapdoor was a gigantic plant, something like an
enormous dieffenbachia with wide leaves emerging from the central
stem like a spiral staircase, but darker-colored than a normal
dieffenbachia, with tendril-like vines emerging from the central
stem and hanging down. The base spread out wide with bigger leaves
and tendrils, as though promising to cushion anyone's fall. Beneath
was another stone chamber like the first, with the same nooks like
false arched windows, emitting the same grey-blue light.</p>
<p>"The obvious thought is to fly down on the broomstick in my
pouch, or toss something heavy to see if those tendrils are traps,"
Harry said, peering down. "But I'm guessing you'll say that we just
walk down the leaves." They certainly looked like they were meant
to be a spiral staircase.</p>
<p>"After you," said Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>Harry carefully put a foot down on a leaf and found that it
indeed supported his weight. Then Harry took a last look around the
room before departing, to see if there was anything worth
noticing.</p>
<p>The enormous dead dog called enough attention to itself that it
was hard to focus on anything else.</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell," Harry said, omitting the phrase <em>your
approach to dealing with obstacles has certain drawbacks,</em>
"what if somebody looks in the door and sees that the Cerberus is
dead?"</p>
<p>"Then they have probably already noticed something wrong with
Snape," said Professor Quirrell. "But since you insist..." The
Defense Professor walked over to the three-headed corpse and placed
his wand against it. He began a Latin-sounding incantation that was
accompanied by a sense of rising apprehension, the Boy-Who-Lived
feeling the Dark Lord's power as he always had.</p>
<p>The last word spoken was <em>"Inferius"</em> and it was
accompanied by a final surge of <em>STOP, DON'T</em>.</p>
<p>And the three-headed dog rose to a stand, its six eyes dull and
blank, turning to watch the door once more.</p>
<p>Harry stared at the huge Inferius with a horrible sinking
sensation in his stomach, the third-worst feeling he'd ever felt in
his life.</p>
<p>He knew then that he'd seen and sensed this procedure before,
only without the spoken Latin.</p>
<p>The centaur who'd confronted him in the Forbidden Forest was
dead. The Defense Professor had hit it with a real Avada Kedavra,
not a fake one.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the back of his mind, Harry had thought that if he
could just get Hermione <em>back</em> then he could return to the
code of nobody dying, the ethic of Batman. Most people went through
their whole lives without anyone getting killed on whatever
adventures they had.</p>
<p>And that was not to be.</p>
<p>He hadn't even noticed, the day he lost his last chance to win.
Even if Hermione was resurrected, now, Harry wouldn't have come
through the whole mess without anyone getting killed.</p>
<p>He hadn't even learned the centaur's name.</p>
<p>Harry said nothing aloud. The Defense Professor would either
confirm the accusation in Parseltongue or lie in plain speech, and
either way the Defense Professor would have more reason to suspect
Harry's next actions. But Harry knew that - although he didn't know
<em>how</em> he would stop Professor Quirrell, although he didn't
dare any positive act of betrayal, maybe not even making the
<em>decision,</em> until it was almost time to win - there would
never be an amicable settlement between him and Lord Voldemort, for
those two different spirits could not exist in the same world.</p>
<p>And it was like that resolution, that knowledge of opposition,
invoked a strength from what Harry had thought of as his dark side.
Harry had stopped trying to call deliberately on his dark side
after the day he'd killed the troll. But his dark side had never
been something separate from him. It had been something remembered
from Tom Riddle. Harry didn't know how that had happened, but
taking the assumption and running with it, whatever echoes of
cognitive skill were in his dark side should be there for him to
use. Not as a separate mode, as Harry had conceptualized at first,
but just as neural patterns with a strong tendency to chain into
one another since they had once formed part of a connected
whole.</p>
<p>This unfortunately did not change that Professor Quirrell had
the same skills with far more life experience backing them up, and
also had the gun.</p>
<p>Harry turned, and set foot on the giant plant, and began to walk
down the spiral staircase provided by the leaves. It had taken
Harry too long this time, but he'd recovered himself to some
degree, despite the grief still weighing him down like thick water.
It wasn't a cold steel rod in his spine, but it was something
straight and solid nonetheless. He was going to play this through,
see Hermione returned to life first, and then, somehow, stop
Professor Quirrell. Or stop Professor Quirrell first and then get
the Stone himself. There had to be something, some possibility,
some opportunity that would present itself, some way to stop
Voldemort <em>and</em> return Hermione to life...</p>
<p>Harry continued his descent.</p>
<p>Behind him, the three-headed dog waited, guarding the gate.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>The next chapter (107) will post
on <strong>February 18th, 2015</strong> at <strong>*2PM* Pacific
Time.</strong></em></p>
</div>
<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 107: The Truth, Pt 4<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>The spiraling leaves of the gigantic dieffenbachia felt like
forest loam beneath Harry's shoes, not as unyielding as concrete,
but supporting his weight. Harry kept a wary eye on the tendrils,
but they remained passive.</p>
<p>When Harry reached the bottom of the leafy spiral staircase, the
tendrils suddenly whipped out and grasped Harry's arms and
legs.</p>
<p>After a brief struggle, Harry allowed himself to go limp.</p>
<p>"Interesting," said Professor Quirrell, as he floated down from
above, not touching any of the plant's leaves or tendrils. "I
notice that you seem to have no trouble losing to a plant."</p>
<p>Harry looked more closely at the Defense Professor, seeing him
now without the lens of panic. Professor Quirrell was upright and
moving, flying without apparent difficulty; the sense of doom about
him was strong. But his eyes were still sunken in the skull, his
arms thin and wasted. The sickness had <em>not</em> been bluff, and
the obvious hypothesis was that the Defense Professor had recently
eaten another unicorn to temporarily regain some strength.</p>
<p>And the Defense Professor was also speaking like the mask of
Professor Quirrell, not like Lord Voldemort, which might not be a
bad thing from Harry's perspective. Harry didn't know why - unless
it was that the Defense Professor still needed him for something -
but it certainly seemed to be in Harry's own interests to play
along.</p>
<p>"You specifically let me walk into this trap, Professor," Harry
answered, just the way he'd have spoken to Professor Quirrell.
<em>Roles, masks, remind him of how it was between us...</em> "On
my own, I'd have used my broomstick."</p>
<p>"Perhaps. How would an ordinary first-year solve this challenge?
If they had their wand, that is." The plant was now reaching
tendrils out toward Professor Quirrell, but Professor Quirrell was
hovering just out of their reach.</p>
<p>Harry had now remembered Professor Sprout talking about a
Devil's Snare plant, which the Herbology textbook had said liked
cool, dark places like caves - though how that could be true of a
leafy plant was anyone's guess. "At a guess, I'd say this is a
Devil's Snare plant and it might retreat from light or heat. So
maybe a first-year could use Lumos? Today I'd use
<em>Inflammare</em>, but I didn't learn that spell until May."</p>
<p>A twirl of the Defense Professor's wand, and a pattern of sprays
of liquid shot out from it, striking the plant near the bases of
its tendrils, hitting with a quiet splat and then a quiet hissing.
All the tendrils touching Harry frantically shot back and began to
beat at the growing wounds appearing on the plant's skin, as if
trying to remove the pain-stimulus; something about the plant gave
the impression that it was screaming soundlessly.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell finished drifting downward. "Now it is afraid
of light, heat, acid, and me."</p>
<p>Harry stepped off the final leaves onto the floor, after a
careful glance at his robes and then the floor to make sure that
none of the acid had splashed anywhere. Harry had begun to suspect
that Professor Quirrell was trying to make some sort of point, but
Harry did not know what that point might be. "I thought we were on
a mission, Professor. I can't stop you, but is it <em>smart</em> to
spend this much time on messing with me?"</p>
<p>"Oh, we have time," said Professor Quirrell, sounding amused.
"There would be a great uproar if we were discovered here, guarded
by an Inferius. You did not act like you had heard of such an
uproar at your Quidditch match, before you arrived in this time and
spoke to Snape as you did."</p>
<p>A slight chill came over Harry, as he comprehended this.
Anything he did to beat Professor Quirrell would have to
<em>not</em> disrupt the school, or at least the Quidditch game,
because it <em>hadn't</em> disrupted the Quidditch game. Even if
enough forces could be called in to subdue Lord Voldemort, it might
not be easy to do it without Professor McGonagall or Professor
Flitwick or anyone else at the Quidditch game noticing...</p>
<p>Fighting a smart enemy was hard.</p>
<p>And even so... even so it seemed to Harry that if he stood in
Professor Quirrell's shoes, he would not be having leisurely
conversations and playing mind games. Professor Quirrell was
gaining <em>something</em> by taking his time here. But what? Was
there some other process that had to run to completion?</p>
<p>"By the by, have you betrayed me yet?" said Professor
Quirrell.</p>
<p><em>"Have not betrayed you yet,</em>" Harry hissed.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor gestured pointedly with the gun he was now
holding in his left hand, and Harry walked ahead to the great
wooden door at the end of the room, and opened it.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The next chamber was smaller in diameter, with a higher ceiling.
The light shining out of the arched alcoves was white, instead of
blue.</p>
<p>Around them whizzed hundreds of winged keys, beating frantically
through the air. After watching for a few seconds, it became clear
that only a single key was the golden color of a Snitch - though it
was moving slower than a Snitch in a real Quidditch game.</p>
<p>On the other end of the room was a door containing a large,
prominent keyhole.</p>
<p>Against the left wall leaned a broomstick, the school's
workhorse Cleansweep Seven.</p>
<p>"Professor," Harry said, staring up at the clouds and flocks of
whizzing keys, "you said you would answer my questions. What
exactly is all this about? If you think you've secured a door so
that it won't open without a key, you keep the key in a safe place
and only give a copy to authorized entrants. You don't <em>give the
key wings</em> and then <em>leave a broomstick propped against the
wall.</em> So what the heck are we doing in here and what is going
on? It's an obvious guess that the magic mirror is the only real
factor guarding the Stone, but why the rest of this - and why
encourage first-years to come here?"</p>
<p>"I am truly not sure," said the Defense Professor. He had
entered the room and taken up station well to Harry's right,
maintaining the distance between them. "But I shall answer, as I
said I would. Dumbledore's way is to do a dozen things which seem
mad, and then only eight of them, or perhaps nine, conceal an inner
meaning. My guess is that Dumbledore intends to make it seem like I
am invited to send a student as my proxy. Precisely so that Lord
Voldemort, as Dumbledore conceives of him, is less tempted to think
himself clever by doing so. Imagine Dumbledore first considering
the issue of how to ward the Stone. Imagine Dumbledore considering
whether to set true dangers to guard the Mirror. Imagine him
imagining some young student blundering through those dangers at my
behest. I think that is what Dumbledore is trying to avoid, by
making it seem as though that strategy is invited, and so not
cunning. Unless, of course, I have misunderstood what Dumbledore
thinks Lord Voldemort will think." Professor Quirrell grinned, and
it looked just as natural, on him, as any grin he'd shown Harry
before. "Plotting does not come naturally to Dumbledore, but he
tries because he must. To that task Dumbledore brings intelligence,
dedication, the ability to learn from his mistakes, and an utter
lack of native talent. He is marvelously hard to predict for that
reason alone."</p>
<p>Harry turned away, looking at the door on the opposite side of
the room. <em>It wasn't a game to him, Professor.</em> "My guess is
that the intended solution for first-years is to ignore the
broomstick and use <em>Wingardium Leviosa</em> to grab the key,
since this isn't a Quidditch game and there are no rules forbidding
that. So what absurdly overpowered spell are you going to unleash
on this one, then?"</p>
<p>There was a brief silence but for the whizzing of keys.</p>
<p>Harry took several steps away from Professor Quirrell. "I
probably shouldn't have said that, should I."</p>
<p>"Oh, no," Professor Quirrell said. "I think that is a quite
reasonable thing to say to the most powerful Dark Wizard in the
world when he is standing not a dozen paces from you."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell put his wand back into the sleeve of his
other hand, the hand that sometimes held the gun.</p>
<p>Then the Defense Professor reached into his mouth and took out
what appeared to be a tooth. He tossed the false tooth high in the
air, and when it came down, it had transformed into a wand that
sparked a strange sense of recognition in Harry's mind, as though
some part of him recognized that wand as being... part of
him...</p>
<p><em>Thirteen and a half inches, yew, with a core of phoenix
feather.</em> Harry had memorized the information when the
wandmaker Olli-something had given it, because it had seemed like
it might be Plot-Relevant. The event, and the thinking that had
underlain it, both felt a lifetime distant.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor raised that wand, and traced in the air a
flaming rune that was all jagged edges and malevolence; Harry took
another instinctive step back. Then Professor Quirrell spoke.
"Az-reth. Az-reth. Az-reth."</p>
<p>The flaming rune began pouring out fire that was...
<em>twisted,</em> as though the jagged edges of the rune had become
the nature of the fire itself. The fire was blazing crimson, shaded
further red than blood, glowing as searingly intense as an
arc-welder. That brilliance in that shade seemed <em>wrong</em> in
its own right, like nothing shaded so far red should give off that
much light; and the searing crimson was shot through with veins of
black that seemed to suck the light from the fire. Within the
blackened fire, outlined in the interplay of crimson and darkness,
animal shapes twisted wildly from one predator to another, cobra to
hyena to scorpion.</p>
<p>"Az-reth. Az-reth. Az-reth." When Professor Quirrell had
repeated the word six times, as much black-crimson fire had poured
out as the volume of a small bush.</p>
<p>The cursed fire slowed in its changes as Professor Quirrell
locked eyes upon it, taking on a single form, the form of a
blackened blood-burning phoenix.</p>
<p>And something told Harry with a terrible certainty that if that
black burning phoenix met Fawkes, the true phoenix would die and
never be reborn.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell made a single gesture with his wand, and the
blackened fire went soaring across the room. It met the door and
its keyhole, and with a single sweep of crimson-burning wings, most
of the door and part of the archway was consumed. Then the tainted
crimson blaze swept on.</p>
<p>Harry had only a glance through the hole to see huge statues
just beginning to raise swords and clubs, when the blackened fire
came among them, and they cracked and burned.</p>
<p>When it ended, the blackened-fire phoenix swept back in through
the hole, and hovered above Professor Quirrell's left shoulder, the
sun-intense crimson claws staying an inch from his robes.</p>
<p>"Go on ahead," said Professor Quirrell. "It's safe now."</p>
<p>Harry walked forward, needing to invoke his dark side's
cognitive patterns in order to maintain calm enough to do it. Harry
stepped over the glowing edges of the remaining part of the door,
and gazed at a chessboard of ruined huge chess-pieces. The
alternating tiles of black and white marble on the floor started
five meters after the ruined doorway, and extended from wall to
wall, but stopped five meters short of the next door on the
opposite side of the room. The ceiling was significantly higher
than any of the statues should have been able to reach.</p>
<p>"I would guess," Harry said, and his dark side's cognitive
patterns kept his voice calm, "that the intended solution is to fly
over the statues using the broomstick from the previous room, since
it wasn't actually needed to get the key?"</p>
<p>From behind, Professor Quirrell laughed, and it was Lord
Voldemort's laugh. "Proceed," said a voice grown colder and higher.
"Go to the next room. I wish to see what you will make of what is
there."</p>
<p><em>Arranged by Dumbledore for first-years,</em> Harry reminded
himself, <em>it WILL be safe,</em> and he walked across the ruined
chessboard, laid his hand upon that door's handle, and pushed it
inward.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Half a second later, Harry slammed the door and leapt back.</p>
<p>It took Harry several seconds to master his breathing, and
master himself. From behind the door came continued loud bellows,
and great slams as of a rock club pounding the floor.</p>
<p>"I suppose," Harry said in a voice grown cold as well, "that
since Dumbledore would hardly put a real mountain troll in there,
the next challenge is an illusion of my worst memories. Like a
Dementor, with the memory projected into the outside world. Very
amusing, Professor."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell advanced himself toward the door, and Harry
stepped well aside. Besides the sense of doom that was now strong
about the Professor, Harry's dark side or just plain instinct was
advising him not to get anywhere near that black-crimson fire
hovering above Professor Quirrell's shoulder.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell swung open the door, and looked in. "Hm,"
Professor Quirrell said. "Just the troll, as you say. Ah, well. I
had hoped to learn something about you more interesting than that.
What lies within is a Kokorhekkus<em>,</em> also known as the
common boggart."</p>
<p>"A boggart? What does that - no, I suppose I know what it
does."</p>
<p>"A boggart," Professor Quirrell said, and now his voice was
again that of a Hogwarts Professor lecturing, "gravitates to dark
enclosures that are rarely opened, such as a neglected cupboard in
the attic. It seeks to be left alone, and it will manifest in
whatever form it thinks will scare you away."</p>
<p>"Scare me away?" Harry said. "I <em>killed</em> the troll."</p>
<p>"You leapt backward out of the room without thinking. A boggart
seeks out the instinctive flinch, not the reasoned threat. Else it
would have selected something more believable. In any case, the
standard counter-Charm for a boggart is, of course, Fiendfyre."
Professor Quirrell gestured, and the blackened fire leapt off his
shoulder and poured through the doorway.</p>
<p>From within the room there was a single squeak, and then
nothing.</p>
<p>They advanced into the boggart's former room, Professor Quirrell
going first this time. With the seeming mountain troll gone, the
room was just another huge chamber lit by sconces of cold blue
light.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's gaze seemed distant, thoughtful. He crossed
the room without waiting for Harry, and swung open the door on the
opposite wall of his own accord.</p>
<p>Harry followed after, and not closely.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>The next chamber contained a cauldron, a rack of bottled
ingredients, chopping boards, stirring sticks, and the other
apparatus of Potions. The light coming from the arched alcoves was
white instead of blue, presumably because color vision was
important to Potions-brewing. Professor Quirrell was already
standing next to the brewing apparatus, scrutinizing a long
parchment he had picked up. The door to the next chamber was
guarded by a curtain of purple fire that would have looked a lot
more threatening, if it hadn't seemed pale and weak by comparison
to the blackened flame hovering over Professor Quirrell's
shoulder<em>.</em></p>
<p>Harry's suspension of disbelief had already checked out on
vacation at this point, so he didn't say anything about how
real-world security systems had the goal of <em>distinguishing</em>
authorized from unauthorized personnel, which meant issuing
challenges that behaved <em>differently</em> around people who were
or weren't supposed to be there. For example, a <em>good</em>
security challenge would be testing whether the entrant knew a lock
combination that only authorized people had been told, and a
<em>bad</em> security challenge would be testing whether the
entrant could brew a potion according to written instructions that
had been helpfully included.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell tossed the parchment toward Harry, and it
fluttured to the ground between them. "What do you make of this?"
said Professor Quirrell, who then stepped back so that Harry could
come forward and pick up the parchment.</p>
<p>"Nope," Harry said after skimming the parchment. "Testing
whether the entrant can solve a ridiculously straightforward logic
puzzle about the order of the ingredients is still not a challenge
that behaves differently for authorized and unauthorized personnel.
It doesn't matter if you use a more interesting logic puzzle about
three idols or a line of people wearing colored hats, you're still
completely missing the point."</p>
<p>"Look at the other side," said Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>Harry turned over the two-foot parchment.</p>
<p>On the other side, written in tiny letters, was the
<em>longest</em> list of brewing instructions Harry had ever seen.
"What on Earth-"</p>
<p>"A <em>potion of effulgence,</em> to quench the purple fire,"
Professor Quirrell said. "It is made by adding the same
ingredients, over and over again, in slightly different ways.
Imagine some eager young group of first-years, passing all the
other chambers, thinking they are just about to reach the magic
mirror, and then encountering this task. This room is the handiwork
of the Potions Master indeed."</p>
<p>Harry glanced pointedly at the blackfire shape on Professor
Quirrell's shoulder. "Fire can't beat fire?"</p>
<p>"It can," said Professor Quirrell. "I am not sure it should.
Suppose this room is trapped?"</p>
<p>Harry did <em>not</em> want to be stuck brewing this potion for
laughs, or for whatever other reason Professor Quirrell was taking
them through these chambers so slowly. The potions recipe had
<em>thirty-five</em> separate occasions for adding bellflowers,
fourteen times to add 'a lock of bright hair'... "Maybe the potion
gives off a lethal gas that is fatal to adult wizards but not
children. Or any of a hundred other deadly tricks, if we're
suddenly being serious. Are we being serious?"</p>
<p>"This room is the handiwork of Severus Snape," Professor
Quirrell said, once more looking thoughtful. "Snape is not a
bystander in this game, not quite. He lacks Dumbledore's
intelligence, but possesses the killing intent that Dumbledore
never had."</p>
<p>"Well, whatever's going on here, it doesn't actually keep out
children," Harry observed. "Lots of first-years made it through.
And if you can somehow keep out everyone <em>except</em> children,
then that, from Dumbledore's perspective, forces Lord Voldemort to
possess a child to enter. I don't see the point, given their
goals."</p>
<p>"Indeed," Professor Quirrell said, rubbing the bridge of his
nose. "But see, boy, this room lacks the triggers and tripsigns
that are upon the others. There are no subtle wards to be defeated.
It is as if I am <em>invited</em> to bypass the Potion and simply
enter - but Snape knows that Lord Voldemort will perceive this. If
in fact there was a trap laid for anyone who did not brew the
potion, then it would be wiser to lay wards, and give no sign that
this room was different from the others."</p>
<p>Harry listened, frowning in concentration. "So... the only point
of leaving off the detection webs is to make you <em>not</em>
bulldoze this room."</p>
<p>"I expect Snape expects me to deduce that as well," the Defense
Professor said. "And past that point I cannot predict at what level
he thinks I will play. I am patient, and I have given myself plenty
of time for this endeavor. But Snape does not know me, he only
knows Lord Voldemort. He has sometimes seen Lord Voldemort shriek
in frustration, and act on impulses that appear counterproductive.
Consider this matter from Snape's perspective: it is the Potions
Master of Hogwarts telling Lord Voldemort to be patient and follow
instructions if he wants to enter, as though Lord Voldemort were a
mere schoolboy. I would find it easy to comply, smiling the while,
and take my vengeance later. But Snape does not know that Lord
Voldemort finds it easy to think this way." Professor Quirrell
looked at Harry. "Boy, you saw me floating in the air by the
Devil's Snare, did you not?"</p>
<p>Harry nodded. Then he noticed his confusion. "My Charms textbook
says that it's impossible for wizards to levitate themselves."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Professor Quirrell, "that is what it says in your
Charms textbook. No wizard may levitate themselves, or any object
supporting their own weight; it is like trying to lift yourself up
by your own bootstraps. Yet Lord Voldemort alone can fly - how?
Answer as quickly as you can."</p>
<p>If the question was answerable by a first-year student - "You
had someone else cast broomstick enchantments on your underwear,
then you Obliviated them."</p>
<p>"Not quite," said Professor Quirrell. "The broomstick
enchantments require a long narrow shape, which must be solid.
Cloth will not do."</p>
<p>Harry's eyebrows furrowed. "How long does the shape have to be?
Can you attach some short broomstick rods to a fabric harness, and
fly using those?"</p>
<p>"Indeed, at first I strapped enchanted rods to my arms and legs,
but that was only to teach myself a new mode of flight." Professor
Quirrell drew back the sleeve of his robes, revealing the bare arm.
"As you can see, I have nothing up my sleeve right now."</p>
<p>Harry absorbed this further constraint. "You had someone cast
broomstick enchantments on your <em>bones?</em> "</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell sighed. "And that was one of Voldemort's most
feared feats, or so I am told. After all these years, and some
amount of reluctant Legilimency, I still do not truly comprehend
what is <em>wrong</em> with ordinary people... But you are not one
of them. It is time for you to begin contributing to this
expedition. You have known Severus Snape more recently than I. Tell
me your own analysis of this room."</p>
<p>Harry hesitated, trying to look thoughtful.</p>
<p>"I will mention," said Professor Quirrell, as the
blackened-fire-phoenix on his shoulder seemed to extend its head
and glare at Harry, "that if you knowingly allow me to fail, I will
call it betrayal. I remind you that the Stone is key to Miss
Granger's resurrection, and that I hold hostage the lives of
hundreds of students."</p>
<p>"I remember," Harry said, and on the heels of this Harry's
wonderful inventive brain came up with a thought.</p>
<p>Harry wasn't sure if he should say it.</p>
<p>The silence stretched.</p>
<p>"Have you thought of anything yet?" said Professor Quirrell.
"Answer in Parseltongue."</p>
<p>No, this was <em>not</em> going to be easy, not against a smart
opponent who could force you to tell the literal truth at any time.
"Severus, at least the modern-day Severus, respects your
intelligence a great deal," Harry said instead. "I think... I think
he might <em>expect</em> Voldemort to believe that Severus wouldn't
believe that Voldemort could pass his test of patience, but Severus
<em>would</em> expect Voldemort to pass it."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell nodded. "That is a plausible theory. Do you
believe it yourself? Answer in Parseltongue."</p>
<p><em>"Yess,</em>" Harry hissed. It might not be safe to withhold
information, not even thoughts and ideas... "Therefore, the point
of this room is to delay Lord Voldemort for an hour. And if I
wanted to kill you, believing what Dumbledore believes, the obvious
thing to try would be a Dementor's Kiss. I mean, they think you're
a disembodied soul - are you, by the way?"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was still. "Dumbledore would not think of
that method," the Defense Professor said after a time. "But Severus
might." Professor Quirrell began to tap a finger against his cheek,
his gaze distant. "You have power over Dementors, boy, can you tell
me if there are any nearby?"</p>
<p>Harry closed his eyes. If there were voids in the world, he
could not feel them. "None that I can sense."</p>
<p>"Answer in Parseltongue."</p>
<p>"<em>Do not ssensse life-eaterss.</em>"</p>
<p>"But you were being honest with me when you suggested the
possibility? You intended no clever trickery?"</p>
<p>"<em>Wass honesst. Not trick.</em>"</p>
<p>"Perhaps there is some means by which Dementors might be
concealed, being told to leap out and eat a possessing soul if they
see one..." Professor Quirrell was still tapping his cheek. "It is
not impossible that I would qualify. Or it can be told to eat
anyone who passes through this room too quickly, or anyone who is
not a child. Bearing in mind that I hold Hermione and hundreds of
other students hostage over you, would you use your power over
Dementors to defend me, if a Dementor unmasked itself? Answer in
Parseltongue."</p>
<p>"<em>Don't know,</em>" Harry hissed.</p>
<p>"<em>Life-eaterss cannot desstroy me, I think,</em>" hissed
Professor Quirrell. "<em>And I will ssimply abandon thiss body if
they approach too closse. Sshall return sswiftly thiss time, and
then there will be no sstopping me. Will torture your parentss for
yearss, to punissh you for balking me. Hundredss of hosstage
sstudentss die, including thosse you call friendss. Now I assk
again. Will you usse power over life-eaterss to protect me, if
life-eaterss come?</em> "</p>
<p>"<em>Yess,</em>" Harry whispered. The sadness and horror that
Harry had pushed down flared up again, and his dark side had no
stored patterns for handling the emotions. <em>Why, Professor
Quirrell, why are you like this...</em></p>
<p>Professor Quirrell smiled. "That reminds me. Have you betrayed
me yet?"</p>
<p>"<em>Have not betrayed you yet.</em>"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell went over to the Potions equipment, and began
chopping a root one-handed, the knife moving almost invisibly fast
and with no apparent effort. The Fiendfyre phoenix drifted over to
the opposite corner of the room and waited there. "All matters
considered in their uncertainty, it seems wiser to expend the time
to pass this room as a first-year would," said the Defense
Professor. "We may as well talk while we are waiting. You had
questions, boy? I said that I would answer them, so ask."</p>

Answers<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p><em>June 13th, 1992.</em></p>
<p>It was the last week of school in Hogwarts, and Professor
Quirrell was still alive, barely. The Defense Professor himself
would be in a healer's bed, this day, as he'd been for almost the
last week.</p>
<p>Hogwarts tradition said that exams were given in the first week
of June, that exam results were released the second week, and that
in the third week, there would be the Leave-Taking Feast on Sunday
and the Hogwarts Express transporting you to London on Monday.</p>
<p>Harry had wondered, a long time ago when he'd first read about
that schedule, just what exactly the students did during the
<em>rest</em> of the second week of June, since 'waiting for exam
results' didn't sound like much; and the answer had surprised him
when he'd found out.</p>
<p>But now the second week of June was done as well, and it was
Saturday; there was nothing left of the year but the Leave-Taking
Feast on the 14th and the Hogwarts Express ride on the 15th.</p>
<p>And nothing had been answered.</p>
<p>Nothing had been resolved.</p>
<p>Hermione's killer hadn't been found.</p>
<p>Somehow Harry had been thinking that, surely, all the truth
would come out by the end of the school year; like that was the end
of a mystery novel and the mystery's answer had been promised him.
Certainly it had to be known by the time the Defense Professor...
died, it couldn't be allowed for Professor Quirrell to <em>die</em>
without knowing the answer, without everything being neatly
resolved. Not exam grades, certainly not death, it was only truth
that finished a story...</p>
<p>But unless you bought Draco Malfoy's latest theory that
Professor Sprout had been assigning and grading less homework
around the time of Hermione being framed for attempted murder,
thereby proving that Professor Sprout had been spending her time
setting it up, the truth remained unfound.</p>
<p>And instead, like the world had priorities that were more like
other people's way of thinking, the year was going to end with a
climactic Quidditch match.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>In the air above the stadium, distant figures on broomsticks
swooped and pirouetted and spun around each other. The red-purplish
truncated tetrahedron that was the Quaffle was caught, tossed,
blocked, and occasionally thrown through floating hoops,
accompanied by stadium-rocking cries of triumph or dismay. Blue and
green and yellow and red-trimmed robes shouted with the enthusiasm
that people felt so easily when no action would be required from
them personally.</p>
<p>It was the first Quidditch match Harry had attended at Hogwarts,
and he'd already decided that it would be the last.</p>
<p>"Davies has the Quaffle!" shouted the amplified voice of Lee
Jordan. "That's another ten points for Ravenclaw in seven... six...
five... holy smokes, he's done it already! Smack through the center
of the central hoop! I've never seen such a winning streak - I'm
calling it right now for Davies becoming Captain next year after
Bortan steps down -"</p>
<p>Lee's voice cut out abruptly and Professor McGonagall's own
amplified voice said, "That's the Ravenclaw team's own business,
Mr. Jordan. Confine yourself to the match, please."</p>
<p>"And the Slytherins take possession - Flint hands off the
Quaffle to the lovely -"</p>
<p>"Mr. Jordan!"</p>
<p>"To the merely acceptable Sharon Vizcaino, whose hair trails
behind her like a comet as she blazes toward the Ravenclaw defense
- now with two Bludgers in close pursuit! Pucey's on Sharon's tail
- what are you doing, Inglebee? - and she swerves in midair to
avoid - IS THAT THE SNITCH? GO, CHO CHANG, GO, HIGGS IS ALREADY -
WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING?"</p>
<p>"Calm down, Mr. Jordan!"</p>
<p>"HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO CALM DOWN? THAT WAS THE WORST MISSED PLAY
I'VE EVER SEEN! And the Snitch is gone - maybe gone for good, after
being missed that badly - Pucey's heading off towards the goal
posts, Inglebee's nowhere near him -"</p>
<p>In a distant era of history, maybe in another world entirely,
Professor Quirrell had undertaken that the House Cup would be
awarded to either Slytherin or Ravenclaw. Or possibly, somehow,
both; for he had promised that three wishes would be granted. So
far it was looking good on two out of three.</p>
<p>If you just went by the current score, Hufflepuff was leading
the race for the House Cup by something like five hundred points,
thanks to Hufflepuff's students doing their homework and
<em>staying out of trouble.</em> It appeared that Professor Snape
had been strategically taking quite a lot of points from
Hufflepuffs for, er, the last seven years or so. Slytherin House,
reigning champion for the last seven years, still had to its
advantage a certain <em>generosity</em> of its Head of House in
handing out points; and this was sufficient to put it neck-and-neck
with Ravenclaw House, home of the academic achievers. Gryffindor
was far behind in the last place, as befit the House of
nonconformists; Gryffindor had Slytherin's profile when it came to
academics and mischief, only without the advantage of Professor
Snape. Even Fred and George had barely broken even on the year.</p>
<p>Ravenclaw House and Slytherin House both needed a lot of points
from <em>somewhere</em> if either wanted to catch up with
Hufflepuff in the next two days.</p>
<p>And so far as anyone knew, Professor Quirrell hadn't done a
single thing leading to the obvious result. It was happening all by
itself, now that one lone Professor in Hogwarts had taught a class
with creative problem-solving.</p>
<p>The final Quidditch match of the year was between Ravenclaw and
Slytherin. Earlier in the year, Gryffindor's initial Quidditch lead
had vanished after their new Seeker, Emmett Shear, fell off a
possibly malfunctioning broomstick during his second game. This had
also required some hasty rescheduling of the remaining games.</p>
<p>This, the final game of the year, wouldn't end until the Snitch
was caught.</p>
<p>Quidditch scores added directly onto the House points total.</p>
<p>And what did you know, today it seemed that both the Slytherin
and Ravenclaw Seekers just could... not... catch... the...
Snitch.</p>
<p>"THE SNITCH WAS PRACTICALLY ON TOP OF YOU, YOU DIM-EYED
DIMWIT!"</p>
<p>"Language, Mr. Jordan, or I'll remove you from this game! Though
it <em>was</em> a terrible play, I admit."</p>
<p>Harry had to admit that Lee Jordan and Professor McGonagall had
a wonderful comedic routine, with Jordan as the banana-man and
Professor McGonagall as the straight-woman; Harry now felt a little
sorry to have missed it at the earlier Quidditch matches. It was a
side of Professor McGonagall he hadn't seen before.</p>
<p>A few seats down from where Harry sat in the Hufflepuff section
of the Quidditch bleachers, there lurked the hulking form of Cedric
Diggory. The Super Hufflepuff had observed the most recent
near-air-collision between Cho Chang and Terence Higgs with the
keen eye of a wizard who was a Seeker and a Quidditch Captain in
his own right.</p>
<p>"The Ravenclaw Seeker is new," Cedric said. "But Higgs is in his
seventh year. I've played against him. He's better than that."</p>
<p>"You think it's a strategy?" asked one of the Hufflepuffs
sitting next to Cedric.</p>
<p>"It would make sense if Slytherin needed some extra points to
lead for the Quidditch Cup," Cedric said. "But Slytherin already
has us beat for the title. What are they thinking? They could've
won right there!"</p>
<p>The game had started at six o' clock in the afternoon. A typical
game would have gone until seven or so, at which point it would
have been time for dinner. June in Scotland meant plenty of
daylight; sunset wasn't until ten.</p>
<p>It was at eight pm and six minutes, according to Harry's watch,
when Slytherin had just scored another 10 points bringing the score
to 170-140, when Cedric Diggory leapt out of his seat and shouted
"<em>Those bastards!"</em></p>
<p>"Yeah!" cried a young boy beside him, leaping to his own feet.
"Who do they think they are, scoring points?"</p>
<p>"Not that!" cried Cedric Diggory. "They're - they're trying to
<em>steal the Cup from us!</em> "</p>
<p>"But we're not in the running any more for -"</p>
<p><em>"Not the Quidditch Cup! The House Cup!"</em></p>
<p>The word spread, with cries of outrage.</p>
<p>That was Harry's cue.</p>
<p>Harry politely asked a Hufflepuff witch sitting next to him, and
another Hufflepuff sitting one row above him, if they could move
aside. Then Harry drew forth from his pouch a huge scroll, and
unfurled it into a 2-meter-tall banner which stuck in place in
midair. The enchantment had been done courtesy of a sixth-year
Ravenclaw who had a reputation for knowing less about Quidditch
than Harry did.</p>
<p>In huge, glowing purple letters, the sign read:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">JUST BUY A CLOCK</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">2 : 06 : 47</p>
<p>Beneath it was a Snitch, with a blinking red X over it.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Second, after second, after second, the time counter
incremented.</p>
<p>As that counter rose higher, there seemed to be an awful lot of
Hufflepuffs who'd decided that they wanted to sit next to Harry's
banner.</p>
<p>As the game dragged on past nine, there also seemed to be a lot
of Gryffindors.</p>
<p>As the sun set and Harry started using Lumos to read his books -
he'd given up on the actual game a long time ago - there were a
noticeable number of Ravenclaws who'd betrayed patriotism for
sanity.</p>
<p>And Professor Sinistra.</p>
<p>And Professor Vector.</p>
<p>And as the stars began to come out, Professor Flitwick.</p>
<p>The climactic final Quidditch game of the year... dragged
on.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>One of the things Harry hadn't planned on, when he'd decided to
do this, was that he would still be out here at - Harry glanced at
his watch - eleven-oh-four at night. Harry was now reading a
sixth-year Transfiguration textbook; or rather he'd weighted the
book open, illuminated by a Muggle glowstick, while he did one of
the exercises. Last week, when the graduating Ravenclaws were
discussing their N.E.W.T. scores, Harry had overheard that
upper-year Transfiguration practice involved several 'shaping
exercises' that relied more on control and precise thinking than
raw power; and Harry had promptly set out to learn those, whacking
himself hard on the forehead for not trying to read <em>all</em>
the later-year textbooks earlier. Professor McGonagall had approved
Harry doing a shaping exercise that involved controlling the way in
which a Transfiguring object approached its final form - for
example, Transfiguring a quill so that the shaft grew out first,
then the barbs. Harry was doing an analogous exercise with pencils,
growing out the lead first, then surrounding it with wood and
finally having the eraser form on top. As Harry had suspected,
focusing his attention and magic into a particular part of the
pencil's ongoing transformation had proven similar to the mental
discipline used in partial Transfiguration - which could indeed
have been used to fake the same effect, by partially Transfiguring
only the outer layers of the object. This way was proving
relatively easier, though.</p>
<p>Harry finished his current pencil and looked up at the Quidditch
game, which was, check, still fantastically boring. Lee Jordan was
commentating in a tone of dull disgust, "Another ten points - yay -
whoopee - and now someone takes possession of the Quaffle again -
ask if I care who."</p>
<p>Almost nobody remaining in the stands was paying attention
either, since everyone who'd remained in the stadium seemed to have
discovered a new and more interesting sport, the debate about how
to amend the House Cup rules and/or Quidditch. The argument had
become heated to the point where all of the nearby Professors were
barely keeping order at a level short of open combat. This
argument, unfortunately, had considerably more than two factions.
Some darned busybodies were proposing sensible-sounding
alternatives to eliminating the Snitch entirely, and this was
threatening to split the vote and sap the momentum for reform.</p>
<p>In retrospect, Harry thought, it would have been nice to have
Draco unfurl his own banner from the Slytherin side saying
'SNITCHES ARE AWESOME', to set the polarity of the debate. Harry
had squinted over at the Slytherin section earlier, but he hadn't
been able to spot Draco anywhere in the stands. Severus Snape, who
could also have been sympathetic enough to play the villainous
opposition, was likewise nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter?" said a voice next to him.</p>
<p>Beside Harry's seat was standing a short but older Hufflepuff
boy, someone who'd never before come to Harry's attention, holding
out a blank parchment envelope with wax dripped on the front. The
wax was also blank, without impression.</p>
<p>"What is it?" said Harry.</p>
<p>"It's <em>me,</em>" said the boy. "With the envelope you gave
me. I know you said not to talk to you, but -"</p>
<p>"Then don't talk to me," Harry said.</p>
<p>The boy tossed the envelope at Harry and walked away, looking
offended. It made Harry wince a little, but it probably hadn't been
the <em>wrong</em> decision considering the temporal issues...</p>
<p>Then Harry broke the unsigned wax seal and drew out the
envelope's contents. It was parchment instead of the Muggle paper
that Harry would have expected, but the writing on it was his own
handwriting, if done with a quill instead of a pen. The parchment
said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Beware the constellation,<br>
and help the watcher of stars.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Pass unseen by the life-eaters'
confederates,<br>
and by the wise and the well-meaning.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Six, and seven in a square,<br>
in the place that is prohibited and bloody stupid.</em></p>
<p>Harry took it in at a glance, then folded the paper again and
put it back into his cloak with another exhaled sigh. 'Beware the
constellation', really? Harry would have expected a riddle left by
himself, to himself, to have been easier to interpret... though
some parts were obvious enough. Clearly future-Harry had been
worried about this paper being intercepted, and while present-Harry
wouldn't ordinarily have thought of the local Aurors as 'the ones
in league with the Dementors of Azkaban', maybe that had been the
best way to say 'Auror' without potentially tipping off anyone else
who read the parchment and did their own best to decrypt it.
Translating the idiom back out of the Parseltongue he'd used during
the Incident with Azkaban... that worked, Harry supposed.</p>
<p>The note had said that Professor Quirrell needed help, and that
whatever was going on needed to pass unnoticed from the Aurors, and
from Dumbledore and McGonagall and Flitwick. Since Time-Turning was
involved already, the obvious solution was to leave for the loo,
travel back in time, and return to the game right after he'd
left.</p>
<p>Harry started to rise from his seat, then hesitated. His
Hufflepuff side was remarking something about leaving the Auror
escorts behind and not telling Professor McGonagall anything, and
wondering if his future self was being <em>stupid.</em></p>
<p>Harry unfolded the parchment again, and took another glance at
the contents.</p>
<p>On closer examination, the riddle-verse didn't say that Harry
couldn't bring <em>anyone</em> along. Draco Malfoy... was he
missing from the Quidditch game because future-Harry, hours in the
past, had brought Draco with him as backup? But that didn't make
sense, there wasn't much marginal improvement in safety from
bringing along another first-year...</p>
<p>...Draco Malfoy would certainly have been present, regardless of
his personal feelings about Quidditch, to watch Slytherin clinch
the House Cup. Had something happened to him?</p>
<p>Suddenly Harry didn't feel as tired anymore.</p>
<p>A trickle of adrenaline was starting to rise in Harry, but no,
this wouldn't be like the troll. The message had <em>told</em>
Harry when to arrive. Harry wouldn't be too late, not this
time.</p>
<p>Harry glanced over at where Cedric Diggory was looking back and
forth, visibly torn between a clutch of Ravenclaws arguing that the
Snitch had to be kept because it was traditional and rules were
rules, and a pack of Hufflepuffs saying that it wasn't fair for the
Seeker to be more important than the other players.</p>
<p>Cedric Diggory had been an excellent dueling tutor to Harry and
Neville, and Harry had thought they'd established a good
relationship. More importantly, a student taking literally all of
the electives would have his own Time-Turner. Maybe Harry could try
to get Cedric to go back in time with him? The Super Hufflepuff
seemed like a good spare wand to have by your side in any sort of
sticky situation...</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p><em>Later, and earlier:</em></p>
<p>Harry's watch now said 11:45, which translated into 6:45pm after
looping back five hours.</p>
<p>"It's time," Harry murmured to the empty air, and began walking
down the third-floor corridor above the grand staircase, on the
right-hand side.</p>
<p>'The place that is prohibited' would ordinarily mean the
Forbidden Forest; that was probably what someone intercepting the
message was meant to think. But the Forbidden Forest was huge, and
there was more than one distinguished location inside it. No
obvious Schelling Point at which to rendezvous, or find some event
that needed intervention.</p>
<p>But when you added the 'bloody stupid' modifier, there was only
one prohibited place in Hogwarts that fit.</p>
<p>And so Harry set forth on that outlawed path where, if rumor
spoke true, all the first-year Gryffindors had gone before. The
third-floor corridor, on the right-hand side. A mysterious door
leading to a series of rooms filled with dangerous and potentially
lethal traps that nobody could possibly get through, especially if
they were only in their first year.</p>
<p>Harry didn't know himself what sort of traps awaited. Which, on
reflection, meant that the students who'd gone through had been
surprisingly scrupulous about not ruining the puzzle for others.
Maybe there was a sign down there saying <em>Don't give it away,
just as a favor to me, sincerely Headmaster Dumbledore</em>. All
Harry knew so far was that the outer door would open to
<em>Alohomora,</em> and that the final room contained a magic
mirror that would show your reflection in some situation you found
highly appealing, which was apparently the big payoff.</p>
<p>The third-floor corridor was illuminated by dim blue light that
seemed to come from nowhere, and the arches were covered with
cobwebs, as though the corridor hadn't been used in centuries
rather than just the last year.</p>
<p>Harry's pouch was loaded with useful Muggle things, and useful
wizarding things, and everything he'd found that could possibly be
a quest item. (Harry had asked Professor McGonagall to recommend
someone who could expand the pouch's capacity, and she'd just done
it herself.) Harry had applied the Charm he'd learned for battles
that made his eyeglasses stick to his face, regardless of how his
head moved. Harry had refreshed the Transfigurations he was
maintaining, both the tiny jewel in the ring on his hand and the
other one, in case he was knocked unconscious. He wasn't literally
ready for anything, but Harry was as ready as he thought he could
be.</p>
<p>The five-sided floor tiles creaked beneath Harry's shoes and
vanished behind him like the future becoming the past. It was
almost 6:49-<em>six, and seven in a square.</em> Obvious if you
thought in Muggle math, otherwise not so much.</p>
<p>Just as Harry was about to round another corner, something
tickled at the back of his mind, and he heard a soft voice
talking.</p>
<p>"...sensible person... wait until later... after certain faculty
had departed..."</p>
<p>Harry stopped, then crept forward as lightly as he could, not
going around the corner, trying to hear Professor Quirrell's voice
better.</p>
<p>There came a louder cough, and then the soft voice spoke again
from around the corner. "But if they were also... to depart
themselves... at that time..." murmured the voice, "they might
think... this final game... makes for the best distraction... left
in this year... a predictable distraction. So I looked... to see
what people of significance... were not at the game... and I saw
the Headmaster missing... but for all my magic can tell me... he
could be in another... realm of existence... I also saw your own
absence... so I decided to go... where you were. That is what I am
doing here... now... what are <em>you</em> doing here?"</p>
<p>Harry breathed shallowly, and listened.</p>
<p>"And just how did you know where I was?" drawled the voice of
Severus Snape, so much louder that Harry nearly jumped.</p>
<p>A small, coughing laugh. "Check your wand... for Trace."</p>
<p>Severus said something in magical pseudo-Latin, and then, "You
dared tamper with my wand? You <em>dared?</em> "</p>
<p>"You are a suspect... just like myself... so your false
indignation is wasted... however finely crafted it may be... now
tell me... what are you doing?"</p>
<p>"I am watching this door," said the voice of Professor Snape.
"And I will ask you to be off from it!"</p>
<p>"On whose authority... are you ordering me... my fellow
Professor?"</p>
<p>There was a pause, then, "Why, the Headmaster's," came the
smooth voice of Severus Snape. "I was ordered by him to watch this
door during the Quidditch match, and as a Professor I must obey his
whims. I shall have words about it with the Board of Governors
later, but for now I am doing as I must. Now be off with you, as
the Headmaster desires."</p>
<p>"What? You mean I am to believe... that you abandoned your
Slytherins... during their most important... game of the year...
and leapt up like a dog... at Dumbledore's word? Well that... I
must say... is entirely plausible. Even so... I think it would be
wise... if I kept my own watch over you.. while you watch this fine
door." There was a sound of rustling cloth and a soft thud, as if
someone had sat down hard upon the ground, or maybe just
fallen.</p>
<p>"Oh, for the love of Merlin -" Severus Snape's voice now sounded
angry. "Get up, you!"</p>
<p>"Ba-blu-a-bu-bluh -" said the Defense Professor's
zombie-mode.</p>
<p>"Get up!" said Severus Snape, and there was a soft thud.</p>
<p><em>Help the watcher of stars -</em></p>
<p>Harry stepped around the corner, though it was possible that
he'd have done so even without an intertemporal message. Had
Professor Snape just <em>kicked</em> Professor Quirrell? That would
have been foolhardy if Professor Quirrell had been dead and
<em>buried.</em></p>
<p>A round-topped door of dark wood was framed within a stone arch,
set within the dusty marble bricks of Hogwarts. Where a Muggle
would have set a doorknob there was only a handle of polished
metal; there were no visible locks, or visible keyholes. Set upon
the wall to either side, a pair of torches burned, sending forth an
ominous orange glow. Before the door stood the Potions Master in
his customary stained robes. Beside the door, to the left side
beneath the orange torch, slumped the form of the Defense
Professor, back against the wall, head staring out at the
surroundings. The eyes seemed to flicker, as if halfway between
awareness, and emptiness.</p>
<p>"<em>What</em>," said the towering form of the Potions Master,
"are you doing here, <em>Potter?</em> "</p>
<p>Going by facial expressions and tone of voice, the Potions
Master was quite angry with Harry; and certainly was not Harry's
co-conspirator in councils to which the Defense Professor had never
been invited.</p>
<p>"I'm not sure," Harry said. He wasn't sure what role he should
be playing, and was, in desperation, falling back on simple
honesty. "I think perhaps I'm supposed to be keeping an eye on the
Defense Professor."</p>
<p>The Potions Master stared at him coldly. "Where's your
<em>escort,</em> Potter? Students are not to wander these halls
alone!"</p>
<p>Harry's mind was genuinely blank. The game was afoot, and nobody
had told him the rules. "I'm not sure how to answer that..."</p>
<p>The cold expression on Professor Snape's face flickered.
"Perhaps I should call the Aurors," he said.</p>
<p>"Wait!" Harry blurted.</p>
<p>The Potions Master's hand hovered about his robes. "Why?" said
the Potions Master.</p>
<p>"I... I just think you probably shouldn't call them..."</p>
<p>In a blur, the Potions Master's wand was in his hand.
"<em>Nullus confundio!"</em> A black jet darted out and hit Harry,
striking in the direction Harry had already started to evade. There
followed four other spells, containing words like
<em>Polyfluis</em> and <em>Metamorphus;</em> and for those Harry
politely stood still.</p>
<p>After all of those spells had failed to produce any effect,
Severus Snape was staring at Harry with a dark glitter that now
seemed genuine. "I suggest," the Potions Master said softly, "that
you explain yourself, Potter."</p>
<p>"I can't explain myself," Harry said. "I don't have the Time,
not yet."</p>
<p>Harry looked directly into the Potions Master's gaze as he said
the words <em>myself</em> and <em>time</em>, widening his own eyes
to try to convey the key information, and the Potions Master
hesitated.</p>
<p>Harry was frantically trying to work out who was pretending to
be what. Since Professor Quirrell wasn't in on Dumbledore's
conspiracy, Severus was pretending to be the evil Potions Master of
Hogwarts, who'd been sent here by the Headmaster... and might or
might not have actually been sent here by Dumbledore... but
Professor Quirrell either thought, or was pretending to think, that
someone needed to keep an eye on Professor Snape... and Harry
himself had been sent here by future-Harry and had no idea why...
and why were they all standing outside the Headmaster's forbidden
door in the first place?</p>
<p>And then...</p>
<p>From behind where Harry stood...</p>
<p>Came the growing sound of another set of footsteps, rapid and
manyfold.</p>
<p>Professor Snape stabbed his wand once, creating a burst of
darkness that shrouded where the Defense Professor was lying.
"<em>Muffliato,</em>" the Potions Master hissed. "Mr. Potter, if
you must be here, then hide! Put on your invisibility cloak! My
duty is to guard this door in case <em>he</em> comes here. And
there has been - a <em>disturbance</em>, meant to draw the
Headmaster, he thinks -"</p>
<p>"Who -"</p>
<p>Severus took a long stride forward and snapped his wand against
the side of Harry's head. There was a trickling sensation like an
egg had been cracked over him, the feeling of a Disillusionment
Charm; and Harry's hands faded out, followed by the rest of
him.</p>
<p>The darkness shrouding one side of the wall dissipated like slow
mist, and there was again visible the huddled form of the Defense
Professor, who said nothing.</p>
<p>Harry tiptoed away quietly as he could, then turned to
watch.</p>
<p>The approaching footsteps rounded the corner -</p>
<p>"What are you doing here?" came many simultaneous cries.</p>
<p>Trimmed in three sets of Slytherin green and one Hufflepuff
yellow stood Theodore Nott, Daphne Greengrass, Susan Bones, and
Tracey Davis.</p>
<p>"<em>Where,</em>" said Professor Snape with mounting wrath, "are
your <em>escorts,</em> children? First-years must be accompanied by
a sixth or seventh-year student at all times! Especially you!"</p>
<p>Theodore Nott raised his hand. "We're, um," said Theodore Nott.
"We're doing what the Chaos Legion calls a team-building
exercise... see, we realized just now that none of us had tried the
Headmaster's forbidden chamber yet, and there wasn't much time
left... and Harry Potter has authorized it, Professor, he said
specifically that <em>you</em> mustn't interfere."</p>
<p>Severus Snape turned to glance over at where Harry Potter had
tiptoed; a storm seemed to be gathering on his brow, and a dark
fury in his eyes.</p>
<p><em>I... maybe?</em> There was still one hour left on Harry's
Time-Turner, so it was possible.</p>
<p>"Harry Potter does not have that authority," the Potions Master
said in a deceptively mild tone. "Explain yourselves, now."</p>
<p>"Really?" said the form of Susan Bones. "Really? You're telling
Professor Snape that Harry Potter authorized the mission, that's
your idea of a bluff?" The young Hufflepuff turned to Professor
Snape and spoke, her voice strangely firm. "Professor, this is the
truth and it's urgent. Draco Malfoy is missing and we think he went
down there -"</p>
<p>"If Mr. Malfoy is missing," said Professor Snape, "<em>why have
the Aurors not been notified?</em> "</p>
<p>"Because of, because of <em>reasons!</em> " cried Daphne
Greengrass. "There's no time, you've got to let us through!"</p>
<p>Professor Snape's voice was now as sardonic as Harry had ever
heard it. "Are you four morons under the impression that you are on
some sort of adventure? Well, you are mistaken. I assure you that
Mr. Malfoy has not passed through this door."</p>
<p>"We think Mr. Malfoy has an invisibility cloak," Susan Bones
said rapidly. "Do you remember the door seeming to open for no
reason?"</p>
<p>"No," the Potions Master said. "Now be gone from here. This
place is off-limits for today."</p>
<p>"This is <em>Dumbledore's</em> forbidden corridor," Tracey said.
"The Headmaster himself said nobody was to come here. Who do you
think you are, forbidding it too?"</p>
<p>"Miss Davis," said the Potions Master, "you need to stop
associating with Gryffindors, especially those named Lavender
Brown. And if you are still here in one minute, I will file papers
requesting your transfer into that House."</p>
<p>"<em>You wouldn't dare!</em> " shrieked Tracey.</p>
<p>"Hm," Susan Bones said, her face screwed up in concentration.
"Professor Snape, do you occasionally open the door yourself, to
check on whatever's inside?"</p>
<p>Professor Snape froze in place. Then he spun and put his right
hand on the metal knocker -</p>
<p>Harry was watching the hand on the knocker, so he didn't notice
what Professor Snape was doing with his left hand until he heard
the sudden outcry.</p>
<p>"No, in fact," said Professor Snape, now holding the choking
head of Draco Malfoy by his collar, though the rest of Draco was
still underneath his invisibility cloak. "A fine try, though."</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " cried Tracey and Daphne.</p>
<p>Susan Bones hit herself in the forehead. "I can't
<em>believe</em> I fell for that."</p>
<p>"So, Mr. Malfoy," Professor Snape said. His voice had lowered.
"You sent your friends here on a ruse... just in the hopes that you
could pass through this door? Now why would you do that?"</p>
<p>"I think we should trust him -" said Theodore Nott. "Mr. Malfoy,
we've <em>got</em> to trust him, he's the one Professor who would
take our side!"</p>
<p>"No!" cried Draco's floating head, from where Professor Snape
was still grasping his collar. "You mustn't say anything!
Stop!"</p>
<p>"We've got to take the chance!" yelled Theodore. "Professor
Snape, Mr. Malfoy finally worked out what's been going on this
whole year, and why - Dumbledore is trying to get the Philosopher's
Stone away from Nicholas Flamel! Because Dumbledore doesn't think
anyone ought to have immortality! So Dumbledore tried to convince
Flamel that the Dark Lord was coming back and needed the Stone to
revive, and asked Flamel to give it to him, but Flamel wouldn't,
and instead Flamel put the Stone in the magic mirror that's down
there, and Dumbledore is finding out right now how to get it, and
then he'll come for it and we've got to get to it first! Dumbledore
really will be all-powerful if he gets the Philosopher's
Stone!"</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " said Tracey. "That's not what you said
before!"</p>
<p>"It -" Daphne said. She looked frightened, but determined. "It
doesn't matter - Professor Snape, please, you <em>have</em> to
believe me. I looked at the books Hermione checked out of the
library, and she was researching the Philosopher's Stone just
before someone killed her. Her notes said that something dangerous
might happen if the Stone stays inside the mirror too long. We have
to get it out of the castle right away."</p>
<p>Susan Bones now had both hands over her face. "I'm not with
them, I just came along to prevent anything even stupider from
happening."</p>
<p>Severus Snape was staring at Theodore Nott and the others. Then
he turned his head to look at Draco Malfoy. "Mr. Malfoy," the
Potions Master drawled. "How did you come to discover Dumbledore's
plot?"</p>
<p>"I deduced it from evidence!" said Draco Malfoy's floating
head.</p>
<p>Professor Snape's head swiveled back to Theodore Nott. "How did
you intend to obtain this Stone from inside a magic mirror that
could supposedly baffle Dumbledore himself? Answer me at once!"</p>
<p>"We're going to take the whole mirror and send it back to
Flamel," said Theodore Nott. "It's not like we want the Stone for
ourselves, we just need to stop Dumbledore from stealing it."</p>
<p>Professor Snape nodded, as though confirming something, and
turned his head to look at the other students. "Tell me, have any
of you noticed one of the others behaving in an unusual fashion?
Especially if there is a peculiar object that they have in their
possession, or they can use spells a first-year should not know?"
Professor Snape's right hand now pointed his wand at Susan Bones.
"I see that Miss Greengrass and Miss Davis are trying not to look
at you, Miss Bones. If there is a mundane explanation, you would be
wise to offer it <em>immediately.</em>"</p>
<p>Susan Bones's hair turned bright red, though her face didn't
change. "I suppose there's not much point keeping it mum any
longer," she said, "since I'm graduating in two days anyway."</p>
<p>"Double witches get to graduate <em>six years</em> early?" said
Tracey Davis. "That's not fair!"</p>
<p><em>"Bones is a double witch?"</em> cried Theodore.</p>
<p>"No, she is Nymphadora Tonks, a Metamorphmagus," Professor Snape
said. "Masquerading as another student is extremely against
regulation, as you are well aware, Miss Tonks. It is not too late
to expel you from Hogwarts two days before your graduation, which
would be a dreadful tragedy - from your perspective, that is. From
my perspective it would be hilarious. Now tell me what exactly you
are doing here."</p>
<p>"That explains it," said Daphne Greengrass. "Um, is there
<em>actually</em> a Susan Bones, or is the House dying out so they
had you secretly -"</p>
<p>The red-haired form of Susan Bones had a palm to her face. "Yes,
Miss Greengrass, there's a real Susan Bones. She only sends me in
when <em>you</em> lot are about to get into ridiculous amounts of
trouble. Professor Snape, the reason I'm here is because Draco
Malfoy was missing, and this lot <em>insisted</em> on trying to
find him instead of calling the Aurors. For reasons the real Miss
Bones said there was no time to explain to me, which I now realize
were stupid. But young students must never go alone, and must be
accompanied by a sixth or seventh year at all times. And now we
found Draco Malfoy and we can all go back. Please? Before this gets
any more ridiculous?"</p>
<p>"<em>What in Merlin's name is going on here?"</em></p>
<p>"Ah," said Professor Snape, who was still pointing the wand at
the red-haired form of Susan Bones, his other hand still grasping
the collar below the disembodied head of Draco Malfoy, standing
next to the crumpled form of the Defense Professor. "Professor
Sprout, I perceive."</p>
<p>"It's not what it looks like," volunteered Tracey Davis.</p>
<p>The short, dumpy form of the Herbology Professor stormed
forwards. She had, by this point, drawn her wand, though she wasn't
pointing it at anyone. <em>"I don't even know what this looks
like!</em> Down wands, all of you, <em>right now!</em> Including
you, Professor!"</p>
<p><em>Distraction.</em> The thought came to Harry with sudden
clarity. Whatever he was watching now, from where he stood
invisibly and well back of the action, it wasn't <em>what was
really going on</em>, it wasn't the true thread of the story, it
had been <em>arranged</em>. Professor Sprout's arrival had broken
Harry's suspension of disbelief; things like that didn't happen
just for the sake of comedic coincidence. Someone was deliberately
causing all this chaos, but what was the point?</p>
<p>Harry really hoped he hadn't gone back in time and done this,
because it did seem like the sort of thing he would do.</p>
<p>Severus Snape lowered his wand. His other hand unfisted Draco
Malfoy. "Professor Sprout," the Potions Master said, "I am here on
the Headmaster's orders to watch this door. Everyone else present
is <em>not</em> supposed to be here, and I ask you to see them
cleared away."</p>
<p>"A likely story," snapped Professor Sprout. "Why would
Dumbledore set you of all people to guard the door to his
playground? It's not as if he wants to keep the students out, oh
no, they need to go in and get stuck in <em>my</em> Devil's Snare!
Susan, dear, you've got a communications mirror, don't you? Use it
to call the Aurors."</p>
<p>The watching Harry nodded to himself. <em>That</em> was the
point. The Aurors would take away everyone present at this terribly
confusing situation, no excuses accepted, and then the door would
be unguarded.</p>
<p>But was Harry meant to go into the forbidden corridor himself?
Or watch, to see who finally came once all the others were
gone?</p>
<p>A loud fit of hacking and coughing caused everyone to look at
where the Defense Professor lay.</p>
<p>"Snape - listen -" said the Defense Professor between coughs.
"Why - Sprout - here -"</p>
<p>The Potions Master looked down.</p>
<p>"Memory Charm - implies - Professor -" The Defense Professor
began coughing again.</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> "</p>
<p>And the logic unfolded in Harry's mind in crystalline dismay,
all the steps already suspected, the dreadful realization coming as
a repetition with greater confidence.</p>
<p>Someone had Memory-Charmed Hermione to believe she'd tried to
kill Draco.</p>
<p>Only a Hogwarts Professor could have done it without alarm.</p>
<p>So all the true mastermind needed to do was Legilimise or
Imperius a Hogwarts Professor.</p>
<p>And the last person anyone would suspect would be the Head of
House Hufflepuff.</p>
<p>Snape's head snapped around, as Professor Sprout raised her
wand, and the Potions Master managed to raise a wordless
translucent ward between them. But the bolt that shot from
Professor Sprout's wand was a dark brown that produced a surge of
awful apprehension in Harry's mind; and the brown bolt made
Severus's shield wink out before they touched, clipping the Potions
Master's right arm even as he dodged. Professor Snape gave a
muffled shriek and his hand spasmed, dropping his wand.</p>
<p>The next bolt that came from Sprout's wand was a bright red the
color of a Stunning Hex, seeming to grow brighter and move faster
even as it left her wand, accompanied by another surge of anxiety;
and that blew the Potions Master into the door, dropping him
motionless to the ground.</p>
<p>By that time pink-haired-Susan-Bones was surrounded by a
multifaceted blue haze and she was firing hex after hex at
Professor Sprout. Professor Sprout was ignoring the hexes to summon
plant tendrils that entangled the younger students as they tried to
run, except Draco Malfoy, who had again vanished beneath his
invisibility cloak.</p>
<p>Not-Susan-Bones stopped casting hexes. She leveled her wand,
took a deep breath, and cried aloud an incantation that sent golden
worms of light chewing into the shield around Professor Sprout. At
that the Herbology Professor turned to face not-Susan, her
expression vacant, a new set of plant tentacles rising in the air
behind her. Those stalks were a darker green, and seemed to have
shields of their own.</p>
<p>Harry Potter murmured to the seemingly empty air, "Attack
Sprout. Help Bones. Nonlethal only."</p>
<p>"Yes, my lord," whispered Lesath Lestrange beneath Harry's Cloak
of Invisibility, and the fifth-year Slytherin's presence moved off
toward the fight.</p>
<p>Harry looked down at at his own hands, and saw with a jolt of
unpleasant shock that his Disillusionment Charm wasn't as complete
as it had been before. There were hints of distortion in the air,
each time Harry moved...</p>
<p>Slowly, Harry stepped backward, until he came to a corner, and
ducked behind a wall. Then he took out his communications mirror...
which was blank and jammed. Of course. Harry levitated the mirror
to where he could use it to see around the corner, and watch the
end of the... distraction? <em>What was happening, why?</em></p>
<p>Professor Sprout and the form of Susan Bones were dueling in
flashes of light and leaves; and the blazing green of a Greater
Drill Hex erupted from midair and chewed halfway through the outer
layer of Professor Sprout's shields. The Herbology Professor turned
and fired a broad wash of yellow at where the Drill Hex had come
from, but the spell didn't seem to hit anything.</p>
<p>Yellow blazes, blue facets, dark green plant-tendrils and
swirling purple flower petals...</p>
<p>It was when Professor Sprout started firing arcs of crimson in
all directions that one of the crimson blades caught something in
midair, the Invisibility Cloak not concealing how the crimson arc
was absorbed and winked out; and Lesath's presence beneath the
Invisibility Cloak fell to the ground.</p>
<p>And that gave not-Susan-Bones time enough to stand still, catch
her breath, and scream something that inspired in Harry another
surge of dread; and the white spark that blazed out went through
Professor Sprout's chewed shields and her plant-armor and dropped
her.</p>
<p>Not-Susan-Bones went to her knees, panting, her robes soaked in
sweat.</p>
<p>Her head turned to look around her, at the bodies lying stunned
on the floor or wrapped in vines.</p>
<p>"What," said not-Susan. "What. What. <em>What.</em>"</p>
<p>There was no reply. The victims entangled in Professor Sprout's
vines weren't moving, though they did seem to be breathing.</p>
<p>"Malfoy..." said the pink-haired form of Susan, still gasping
for breath. "Draco Malfoy, where are you? Are you there? Call the
Aurors already! Merlin damn it - <em>Homenum Revelio!</em> "</p>
<p>And Harry found himself visible again, staring in his mirror at
the form of Draco Malfoy half-visible beneath a shimmering cloak,
standing behind not-Susan, pointing his wand at a gap in
not-Susan's blue haze.</p>
<p>Harry's mind moved in flashes of insight, too slow and yet too
fast; even as Harry's mouth opened and he inhaled in preparation to
shout.</p>
<p><em>beware the constellation<br></em>there was a constellation
named Draco<br>
if you could control a Professor you could control a student</p>
<p><em>"Duck!"</em> Harry shouted, but it was too late, a bolt of
red light caught the back of not-Susan's head at point-blank,
smashing her to the floor.</p>
<p>Harry stepped around the corner and said, "<em>Somnium Somnium
Somnium Somnium Somnium Somnium.</em>"</p>
<p>Draco Malfoy's shimmering form collapsed in a heap.</p>
<p>Harry took a moment to catch his breath. Then Harry said
"<em>Stupefy!</em> " and verified that, yes, the Stunning Hex did
hit Draco Malfoy's form.</p>
<p>(You could be mistaken about whether a Somnium had really hit.
Harry had seen enough horror movies, not to mention the business
with the Sunshine Regiment, that he wasn't about to make
<em>that</em> error again.)</p>
<p>After a further reflection on this, Harry cast another Stunning
Hex into the prostrate form of Professor Sprout.</p>
<p>Harry gripped his wand, staring at the scene, breathing heavily
from the exhaustion. He didn't have enough magic left to cast a
messenger Patronus to Dumbledore and he <em>really really</em>
should have thought of that possibility immediately this time
around. Harry started to reach back to where his mirror had fallen,
to see if it was now unjammed.</p>
<p>And then Harry hesitated.</p>
<p>His note to himself had said to avoid notice from Aurors, and
Harry still <em>did not know what was going on.</em></p>
<p>The crumpled form of Professor Quirrell gave another series of
racking coughs, reached out a hand to the wall beside him, and
slowly pulled himself to his feet.</p>
<p>"Harry," croaked Professor Quirrell. "Harry. Are you there?"</p>
<p>It was the first time Professor Quirrell had ever called him by
his first name.</p>
<p>"I'm here," Harry said. Without any conscious thought, his feet
were moving forward.</p>
<p>"Please," said Professor Quirrell. "Please, I haven't... much
time. Please take me... to the mirror... help me... get the
Stone."</p>
<p>"The <em>Philosopher's</em> Stone?" Harry said. He glanced
around at the scattered bodies, but he couldn't see Draco anymore,
the revealment had worn off. "You think Mr. Nott was
<em>right?</em> I don't think Dumbledore would -"</p>
<p>"Not - Dumbledore," gasped Professor Quirrell. "Because - Sprout
-"</p>
<p>"I understand," Harry said. If Dumbledore had been the one
behind it all, he wouldn't have needed to mind-control a Professor
in order to use Memory Charms.</p>
<p>"Mirror... ancient relic... could hide anything... Stone could
be there... many others want Stone... one sent Sprout..."</p>
<p>Harry repeated rapidly, "The mirror down there is an ancient
relic that can be used to hide things, and it would be one possible
place to hide the Philosopher's Stone. If the Philosopher's Stone
is inside the mirror then any number of people might want to get
it. One of them is controlling Sprout and that would explain what
their goal really is... only... that doesn't explain why Sprout's
controller would go after Hermione?"</p>
<p>"Harry, please," Professor Quirrell said. His breathing was yet
more labored now, his voice came with excruciating slowness. "It's
the one thing... that can save my life... and I find, now... I
don't want to die... please, help me..."</p>
<p>And somehow that tore it.</p>
<p>Somehow that was a little too much.</p>
<p>The sense of detachment that had come over Harry when Professor
Sprout had arrived, the broken suspension of disbelief, was
returning; his Inner Critic weighing up everything as though it
were a set-piece. Timing, probability, so many people showing up at
the same door, the Defense Professor's desperation... this whole
situation didn't feel real. But he might be able to <em>solve
it</em> if he just took time to think things through in advance,
instead of running off at adventure's first call. All the
accumulated experience from the last year had finally crystallized
into something like a touch of battle hardening. An instinct born
of past disaster was telling Harry that if he just rushed on ahead,
he would end up afterward in a sad conversation, realizing that
he'd been stupid. <em>Again.</em></p>
<p>"Let me think," Harry said. "Let me think for a minute before we
go." He turned away from the Defense Professor, looking at the
unconscious bodies draped in various shapes over the floor. There'd
been so many puzzle pieces already, this last year, maybe
everything would just fall into place with one more piece...</p>
<p>"Harry..." the Defense Professor said in a faltering voice.
"Harry, I'm dying..."</p>
<p><em>One more minute can't make the difference he's had the WHOLE
YEAR to be sick it's IMPROBABLE that his life versus death would be
precisely timed to rest on this last minute no matter what happened
to Hermione -</em></p>
<p>"I <em>know!</em> " Harry said. "I'll think
<em>quickly!</em> "</p>
<p>Harry stared at the bodies and tried to think. There was no time
for doubts, for caveats, no brakes or second-guessing just take the
first thoughts and <em>run with them -</em></p>
<p>In the back of Harry's mind, fragments of abstract thought
flitted past, heuristics of problem-solving that there was no time
to rehearse in words. In wordless flashes they shot past, to set up
the object-level problem.</p>
<p>- <em>what do I notice I am confused by -</em></p>
<p><em>- the first place to look for a problem is whatever aspect
of the situation seems most improbable -</em></p>
<p><em>- simple explanations are more probable, eliminate separate
improbabilities that must be postulated -</em></p>
<p>Professor Snape had already been here then Professor Quirrell
had arrived then Harry had arrived (via Time-Turner) then the
adventuring party had arrived and Draco had been revealed (part of
the party) then Professor Sprout had shown up.</p>
<p>Too many people had shown up <em>synchronously</em> and that was
too much coincidence, it was <em>improbable</em> that so many
different parties would show up at the same location within a
five-minute window, there <em>had</em> to be hidden
entanglements.</p>
<p>Label Sprout's controller as the mastermind who had ordered
Hermione Memory-Charmed. The mastermind had sent Sprout.</p>
<p>Professor Snape had said that the Headmaster had sent him to
guard the door after there'd been some sort of
<em>disturbance</em>, if the mastermind had caused that as a
distraction then that explained Severus's presence as well.</p>
<p>Harry wasn't sure any more that Draco had been controlled by the
mastermind, that hypothesis had come to him in the spur of the
moment, Draco might have just been trying to drop not-Susan so he
could get into the corridor unhindered-</p>
<p>No that was the wrong way to think, turn it around, try to
<em>explain</em> the timed presence of Draco and his adventuring
party, no time for self-questioning, <em>run with the
hypothesis,</em> therefore suppose Sprout's mastermind had sent
Draco or triggered his coming.</p>
<p>That was three arrivals explained.</p>
<p>Harry had shown up because his note to himself had told him to
do so. That could be attributed to time travel.</p>
<p>That left the Defense Professor who'd said he was following
Snape, only that didn't <em>really</em> seem like an adequate
reason for Professor Quirrell to show up it didn't really make
Harry feel less confused and so maybe the mastermind had also
controlled the timing of Professor Quirrell's presence somehow and
even arranged for Harry himself to enter the time loop.</p>
<p>Harry's mind hit a stumbling-block, he couldn't see how to
extend that reasoning further.</p>
<p>There was no time to stare blankly at stumbling-blocks.</p>
<p>Without any pause or braking Harry's mind attacked the problem
from a new angle.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell had deduced a controlled Hogwarts Professor
from the need for some Professor to Memory-Charm Hermione which
meant that Professor Sprout's controller had framed and then
murdered Hermione which meant Professor Sprout's controller had
detailed information about Hogwarts life and maybe a personal
interest in the Boy-Who-Lived and his friends.</p>
<p>Harry's mind finally threw up the relevant memory, Dumbledore
saying that Lord Voldemort's strongest road to life was hidden here
inside Hogwarts <em>run with the hypothesis</em> so that
resurrection tool was the Philosopher's Stone hidden inside the
mirror <em>why had Dumbledore put the mirror into a corridor
first-years could get through no ignore this question it's not
important right now</em> and Professor Quirrell had said the
Philosopher's Stone possessed great healing power so that part also
fit.</p>
<p>But if it was the Philosopher's Stone that was hidden in the
mirror to keep it away from the Dark Lord, that meant the mirror
also contained the one thing in the world that could save the
Defense Professor's life -</p>
<p>Harry's mind tried to hesitate, to flinch away, feeling a sudden
apprehension as to where this was going.</p>
<p>But there was no time allowed for hesitation.</p>
<p>-and that was also far too much coincidence just too much
improbability if your mind didn't write it off as an amazing plot
twist like you were inside a story.</p>
<p>Could the putative Dark Lord also be manipulating Professor
Quirrell so that Professor Quirrell would discover his supposed
salvation at the right time so that Harry and Professor Quirrell
would go get the resurrection tool from the mirror that might not
even actually be the Philosopher's Stone and then the Dark Lord's
avatar or some other servant would show up and seize it from them
that would explain <em>all</em> the synchronies and negate every
coincidence.</p>
<p>Or Professor Quirrell had known from the beginning that the one
thing that could save his life was hidden inside this mirror and
that was why he had agreed to teach Defense at Hogwarts and now he
was finally trying to get it but then why wait until he was this
sick to even try and why had Sprout shown up at the same time as
Professor Quirrell -</p>
<p>Harry's mind faltered harder.</p>
<p>His inner eye was looking in a direction it was afraid to
look.</p>
<p><em>The note I sent myself said to help the watcher of stars. I
wouldn't send myself a note saying that, if I hadn't already worked
out in the future that it was the right thing to do - maybe the
note is just telling me to get on with it -</em></p>
<p>A small note of confusion was promoted to conscious
attention.</p>
<p>The coded message on the parchment... one or two lines hadn't
quite sounded right, hadn't sounded like the code Harry would
expect himself to use...</p>
<p>"Harry," whispered the dying voice of Professor Quirrell from
behind him. "Harry, please."</p>
<p>"I'm almost done thinking," Harry's voice said aloud, and Harry
realized as he spoke the words that they were true.</p>
<p>Turn it around.</p>
<p>Look at it from the Enemy's perspective, from where the Enemy
does their own intelligent planning, somewhere out of your
sight.</p>
<p>There are Aurors in Hogwarts, and your target Harry Potter is
now fully on guard. Harry Potter will call in Aurors at the first
sign of trouble, or send a Patronus to Albus Dumbledore.
Considering that as a puzzle, one creative solution is to -</p>
<p>- forge a supposedly Time-Turned message to Harry Potter from
himself, telling Harry Potter <em>not</em> to call for help,
telling him to be at the place and time you want him to be. You get
the target himself to bypass all the protections he set up. You
even bypass his protection of skepticism with the overriding
authority of his own future self's judgment.</p>
<p>It isn't even difficult. You can Memory-Charm some random
student into remembering Harry Potter handing over an envelope to
be given back to himself later.</p>
<p>You can Memory-Charm that student because you are a Hogwarts
Professor.</p>
<p>You don't go to the extra effort to steal a pencil and Muggle
paper from Harry Potter's pouch. Instead you forge Harry Potter's
handwriting on wizard parchment. You can forge Harry Potter's
handwriting because you have seen it on Ministry-mandated exams you
have graded.</p>
<p>You call Draco Malfoy 'the constellation' because you know Harry
Potter is interested in astronomy and you are a wizard and you have
taken Astronomy and memorised the names of all the constellations.
But it's not the natural code that Harry Potter would use to
describe Draco Malfoy to himself, that would have been 'the
apprentice'.</p>
<p>You call Professor Quirrell 'the watcher of stars', and tell
Harry Potter to help him.</p>
<p>You know that life-eater is how you say 'Dementor' in
Parseltongue and you expect Harry Potter to think of the Aurors as
being in league with them.</p>
<p>You encode 6:49 as 'six, and seven in a square' because you have
been reading a Muggle physics book that Harry Potter gave you.</p>
<p>Who are you, then?</p>
<p>Harry noticed his breathing had sped up, and with a burst of
heartrate, Harry slowed his breath down again, Professor Quirrell
was <em>watching him</em>.</p>
<p>What if hypothetically speaking Professor Quirrell was the
mastermind and had faked Harry's message then that explained all
five parties showing up the whole synchronous coordination of the
comedy and then Professor Sprout was just controlled to give
Professor Quirrell deniability let him blame someone else for the
False Memory Charm after the dust settled but</p>
<p>But why would Professor Quirrell risk the fragile alliance Harry
had with Draco via the attempted murder-frame</p>
<p>(that Professor Quirrell had 'detected' and 'stopped' allegedly
via a tracer put on Draco)</p>
<p>Why would Professor Quirrell kill Hermione</p>
<p>(if his first attempt to remove her hadn't worked)</p>
<p>If Professor Quirrell was the bad guy then he might have lied
about everything to do with horcruxes and maybe it wasn't
coincidence at all that the only thing that could save his life was
the avenue that could resurrect the Dark Lord what if the Dark Lord
had arranged that too somehow</p>
<p>(one day David Monroe had mysteriously disappeared, presumed
dead at the Dark Lord's hands)</p>
<p>An awful intuition had come over Harry, something separate from
all the reasoning he'd done so far, an intuition that Harry
couldn't put into words; except that he and the Defense Professor
were very much alike in certain ways, and faking a Time-Turned
message was just the sort of creative method that Harry himself
might have tried to bypass all of a target's protections -</p>
<p>And that was when Harry finally realized what should have been
obvious from the very, very beginning.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was smart.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was smart in the same way as Harry.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was smart in exactly the same way as Harry's
mysterious dark side.</p>
<p>If you had to guess when the Boy-Who-Lived had acquired his
mysterious dark side, the obvious guess was the night of October
31st, 1981.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>And<br>
And<br>
And Professor Quirrell had known a password that Bellatrix Black
had thought identified the Dark Lord and his presence gave the
Boy-Who-Lived a sense of doom and his magic interacted
destructively with Harry's and his favorite spell was Avada Kedavra
and and and -</p>
<p>The realization blasted through Harry like a vast dam breaking,
releasing out all its water, bursting through his mind in an
irresistible flood that swept everything away.</p>
<p>There is only one reality that generates all of the
observations.</p>
<p>If different observations seem to point in incompatible
directions, it means the true hypothesis is one you haven't thought
of yet.</p>
<p>And in those cases, when you finally think of the correct
hypothesis, everything aligns behind it, beyond denial or horror,
tearing away every doubt and every emotion that might stand in its
path.</p>
<p>- and then 'David Monroe' and 'Lord Voldemort' had just been one
person playing both sides of the Wizarding War and that was why the
Monroe family had been killed before they could meet 'David Monroe'
just like Moody had suspected -</p>
<p>Reality settled down into a single known state, one coherent
state-of-affairs that compactly generated the observation set.</p>
<p>Harry didn't jump, didn't change his breathing, tried not to
show a single sign of the horror and agony flooding his mind.</p>
<p>The Enemy was behind him, watching him.</p>
<p>"All right," Harry said out loud, as soon as he dared trust his
voice to sound normal. He kept on staring at the bodies, looking
away from Professor Quirrell, because Harry didn't trust his own
face. Harry lifted a sleeve to wipe away the sweat on his forehead,
trying to make the gesture look casual; Harry couldn't control the
sweat, or the rapid hammering in his chest. "Let's go get the
Philosopher's Stone."</p>
<p>All Harry needed was a single moment of distraction anywhere
along the way to use his Time-Turner.</p>
<p>There was no reply from behind him.</p>
<p>The silence stretched.</p>
<p>Slowly, Harry turned around.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was standing upright and smiling.</p>
<p>In the Defense Professor's hand was a shape of black metal
pointed at Harry's wand arm, held with the sure grip of someone who
knew exactly how to use a semiautomatic handgun.</p>
<p>Harry's mouth was dry, even his lips were trembling with
adrenaline, but he managed to speak. "Hello, Lord Voldemort."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell inclined his head in acknowledgement, and
said, "Hello, Tom Riddle."</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Ch. 105 will post on
<strong>February 16th, 2015</strong> at <strong>5PM Pacific

<p style="text-align:center;"><em>There are no author's notes for
Ch. 104.</em></p>

<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 109: Reflections<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p><em>Even the greatest artifact can be defeated by a
counter-artifact that is lesser, but specialized.</em></p>
<p>That was what the Defense Professor had told Harry, after
dropping the True Cloak of Invisibility to pool in fuliginous folds
near Harry's shoes.</p>
<p><em>The Mirror of Perfect Reflection has power over what is
reflected within it, and that power is said to be unchallengeable.
But since the True Cloak of Invisibility produces a perfect absence
of image, it should evade this principle rather than challenging
it.</em></p>
<p>There had followed a series of questions in Parseltongue
establishing that Harry currently did not intend to do anything
stupid or try to run away, and further reminders that Professor
Quirrell could sense him and had spells to detect the Cloak and was
holding hostage hundreds of lives plus Hermione.</p>
<p>Then Harry was told to don the Cloak, open the door that lay
beyond the quenched fires, and advance through the door into the
final chamber; as Professor Quirrell stood well back, outside of
that door's sight.</p>
<p>The last chamber was illuminated in lights of soft gold, and the
stone walls were of gentle white and faced with marble.</p>
<p>In the center of the room stood a simple and unornamented golden
frame, and within the frame was a portal to another
gold-illuminated room, beyond whose door which lay another Potions
chamber; that was what Harry's brain told him. The Mirror's
transformation of light was so perfect that conscious thought was
required to deduce that the room inside the frame was only a
reflection, rather than a portal. (Though it might have been easier
to intuit if Harry hadn't been invisible, just then.)</p>
<p>The Mirror did not touch the ground; the golden frame had no
feet. It didn't look like it was hovering; it looked like it was
fixed in place, more solid and more motionless than the walls
themselves, like it was nailed to the reference frame of the
Earth's motion.</p>
<p>"Is the Mirror there? Is it moving?" came Professor Quirrell's
commanding voice from the Potions Chamber.</p>
<p>"<em>Iss there,</em>" Harry hissed back. "<em>Not
moving.</em>"</p>
<p>Again tones of command rang forth. "Walk around to the back of
the Mirror."</p>
<p>From behind, the golden frame appeared solid, showing no
reflections, and Harry said so in Parseltongue.</p>
<p>"Now take off your Cloak," commanded Professor Quirrell's voice
still from within the Potions room. "Report to me at once if the
Mirror moves to face you."</p>
<p>Harry took off his Cloak.</p>
<p>The Mirror remained nailed to the reference frame of Earth's
motion; and Harry reported this.</p>
<p>Shortly after there came a hissing and seething, and a balefire
phoenix melted through the marble wall behind Harry, the ambient
light in the room taking on a red tinge as it entered. Professor
Quirrell followed behind it, walking out of the new-made corridor
that had been carved, his black formal shoes unharmed by the
red-glowing molten surface beneath. "Well," Professor Quirrell
said, "that is one possible trap averted. And now..." Professor
Quirrell exhaled. "Now we will think of possible strategies for
retrieving the Stone from the Mirror, and you will try them; for I
prefer not to let my own image be reflected. I give you fair
warning, this is the part that may prove tedious."</p>
<p>"I take it this isn't a problem you can solve with
Fiendfyre?"</p>
<p>"Ha," said Professor Quirrell, and gestured.</p>
<p>The balefire phoenix moved forward in a rush of crimson terror,
the red light casting writhing shadows on the remaining marble
walls. Harry jumped back before he could think.</p>
<p>The dreadful dark-red blaze rushed past Professor Quirrell,
surged into the golden back of the Mirror, and disappeared as fast
as it touched the gold.</p>
<p>Then the fire was gone, and the room was tinged scarlet no
more.</p>
<p>There was no scratch upon the golden surface, no glow to mark
the absorption of heat. The Mirror had simply remained in place,
untouched.</p>
<p>Chills went down Harry's spine. If he'd been playing Dungeons
and Dragons and the dungeon master had reported that result, Harry
would have suspected a mental illusion, and rolled to
disbelieve.</p>
<p>Upon the center of the golden back had appeared a sequence of
runes in no known alphabet, black absences of light in small lines
and curves, arranged in a level horizontal row. The thought
occurred to Harry that some minor concealing illusion had been
consumed in the Fiendfyre, a far lesser enchantment that had been
added to prevent children from seeing those letters...</p>
<p>"How old is this Mirror?" Harry said in almost a whisper.</p>
<p>"Nobody knows, Mr. Potter." The Defense Professor reached out
his fingers toward the runes, a look of something like reverence on
his face; but his fingers did not touch the gold. "But my guess is
the same as yours, I think. It is said, in certain legends that may
or may not be fabrications, that this Mirror reflects
<em>itself</em> perfectly and therefore its existence is absolutely
stable. So stable that the Mirror was able to survive when every
other effect of Atlantis was undone, all its consequences severed
from Time. You can see why I was amused when you suggested
Fiendfyre." The Defense Professor let his hand fall.</p>
<p>Even in the middle of everything else, Harry felt the awe, if
that was true. The golden frame gleamed no brighter than before,
for all the revelation; but you could imagine it going back, and
back, into a civilization that had been made to never be... "What -
does the Mirror <em>do,</em> exactly?"</p>
<p>"An excellent question," said Professor Quirrell. "The answer is
in the runes that are written upon the Mirror's golden frame. Read
them to me."</p>
<p>"They're not in any alphabet I recognize. They look like
randomly oriented chicken-scratches drawn by Tolkien elves."</p>
<p>"Read them anyway. <em>Iss not dangerouss.</em>"</p>
<p>"The runes say, <em>noitilov detalo partxe tnere hoc ruoy tu
becafruoy ton wo hsi -</em>" Harry stopped, feeling more prickles
at his spine.</p>
<p>Harry knew what the rune for noitilov <em>meant</em>. It meant
noitilov. And the next runes said to detalo the noitilov until it
reached partxe, then keep the part that was both tnere and hoc.
That belief felt like knowledge, like he could have answered 'Yes'
with confident authority if somebody asked him whether the ton wo
was ruoy or becafruoy. It was just that when Harry tried to relate
those concepts to any other concepts, he drew a blank.</p>
<p><em>"Do you undersstand what wordss mean, boy?"</em></p>
<p><em>"Don't think sso."</em></p>
<p>Professor Quirrell gave a soft exhalation, his eyes not leaving
the golden frame. "I had wondered if perhaps the Words of False
Comprehension might be understandable to a student of Muggle
science. Apparently not."</p>
<p>"Maybe -" Harry began.</p>
<p><em>Really, Ravenclaw?</em> said Slytherin. <em>You're pulling
this</em> <em>NOW?</em></p>
<p>"Maybe I could try again to understand the words if I knew more
about the Mirror?" said Harry's Ravenclaw part, which had assumed
direct control.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's lips quirked up. "As with most ancient
things, scholars have written down enough lies that it is hard to
be sure of anything by now. It is definite that the Mirror is at
least as old as Merlin, for it is known that Merlin used it as a
tool. It is also known that after his death, Merlin left written
instructions that the Mirror did not need to be sealed away,
despite it having certain powers that might normally cause one to
worry. He wrote that, given how painstakingly the Mirror had been
crafted to not destroy the world, it would be easier to destroy the
world using a lump of cheese."</p>
<p>This statement struck Harry as not entirely reassuring.</p>
<p>"Certain other facts about the Mirror are attested by famous
wizards who were reasonably skeptical, and whose word has otherwise
proven reliable. The Mirror's most characteristic power is to
create alternate realms of existence, though these realms are only
as large in size as what can be seen within the Mirror; it is known
that people and other objects can be stored therein. It is claimed
by several authorities that the Mirror alone of all magics
possesses a true moral orientation, though I am not sure what that
could mean in practical terms. I would expect moralists to call the
Cruciatus Curse by their name of 'evil' and the Patronus Charm by
their name of 'good'; I cannot guess what a moralist would think
was any <em>more</em> moral than that. But it is claimed, for
example, that phoenixes came into our world from a realm that was
evoked inside this Mirror."</p>
<p>Words like <em>Jeepers</em> and what his parents would have
termed inappropriate language were all running through Harry's
head, none very coherently, as he stared at the golden back of the
Mirror.</p>
<p>"I have wandered the world and encountered many stories that are
not often heard," said Professor Quirrell. "Most of them seemed to
me to be lies, but a few had the ring of history rather than
storytelling. Upon a wall of metal in a place where no one had come
for centuries, I found written the claim that some Atlanteans
foresaw their world's end, and sought to forge a device of great
power to avert the inevitable catastrophe. If that device had been
completed, the story claimed, it would have become an absolutely
stable existence that could withstand the channeling of unlimited
magic in order to grant wishes. And also - this was said to be the
vastly harder task - the device would somehow avert the inevitable
catastrophes any sane person would expect to follow from that
premise. The aspect I found interesting was that, according to the
tale writ upon those metal plates, the rest of Atlantis ignored
this project and went upon their ways. It was sometimes praised as
a noble public endeavor, but nearly all other Atlanteans found more
important things to do on any given day than help. Even the
Atlantean nobles ignored the prospect of somebody other than
themselves obtaining unchallengeable power, which a less
experienced cynic might expect to catch their attention. With
relatively little support, the tiny handful of would-be makers of
this device labored under working conditions that were not so much
dramatically arduous, as pointlessly annoying. Eventually time ran
out and Atlantis was destroyed with the device still far from
complete. I recognise certain echoes of my own experience that one
does not usually see invented in mere tales." A twist in the dry
smile. "But perhaps that is merely my own preference for one tale
among a hundred other legends. You perceive, however, the echo of
Merlin's statement about the Mirror's creators shaping it to not
destroy the world. Most importantly for our purposes, it may
explain why the Mirror would have the previously unknown capability
that Dumbledore or Perenelle seems to have evoked, of showing any
person who steps before it an illusion of a world in which one of
their desires has been fulfilled. It is the sort of sensible
precaution you can imagine someone building into a wish-granting
creation meant to not go horribly wrong."</p>
<p>"Wow," Harry whispered, and meant it. This was Magic with a
capital M, the sort of Magic that appeared in <em>So You Want To Be
A Wizard,</em> not just a collection of random physics-violating
things you could do with a wand.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell gestured at the golden back. "The final
property upon which most tales agree, is that whatever the unknown
means of commanding the Mirror - of that Key there are no plausible
accounts - the Mirror's instructions cannot be shaped to react to
individual people. So it is not possible for Perenelle to command
this Mirror, 'only give the Stone to Perenelle'. Dumbledore cannot
state, 'Only give the Stone to one who wishes to give it to
Nicholas Flamel'. There is in the Mirror a blindness such as
philosophers have attributed to ideal justice; it must treat all
who come before it by the same rule, whatever rule may be in force.
Thus, there must be some rule for reaching the Stone's hiding-place
which anyone can invoke. And now you see why <em>you</em>, called
the Boy-Who-Lived, shall implement whatever strategies the two of
us devise. For it was said that this thing possesses a moral
orientation, and it may have been given commands reflecting the
same. I am well aware that on conventional terms you are said to be
Good, just as I am said to be Evil." Professor Quirrell smiled,
rather darkly. "So as our first attempt - though not our last, rest
assured-let us see what this Mirror makes of your attempt to
retrieve the Stone in order to save the life of Hermione Granger
and hundreds of your fellow students."</p>
<p>"And the <em>first</em> version of that plan," said Harry, who
was beginning to finally understand, "the one you invented on
Friday in my first week of Hogwarts, called for the Stone to be
retrieved by Dumbledore's golden child, the Boy-Who-Lived, making a
selfless and noble attempt to save the life of his dying Defense
teacher, Professor Quirrell."</p>
<p>"Of course," said Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>It was a poetical sort of plot, Harry supposed, but his
appreciation of that elegance was being hampered by the surrounding
circumstances.</p>
<p>Then another thought occurred to Harry.</p>
<p>"Um," Harry said. "You think that this Mirror is a trap for you
-"</p>
<p>"There is no way beneath the heavens that it is not meant as a
trap."</p>
<p>"That is to say, it's a trap for Lord Voldemort. Only it can't
be a trap for him personally. There has to be a general rule that
underlies it, some generalizable quality of Lord Voldemort that
triggers it." Without conscious awareness, Harry was frowning hard
at the Mirror's golden back.</p>
<p>"As you say," said Professor Quirrell, who was beginning to
frown at Harry's frowning.</p>
<p>"Well, on the first Thursday of this year, the mad Headmaster
Dumbledore, who I'd just seen incinerate a chicken, told me that I
had no chance whatsoever of getting into his forbidden corridor,
since I didn't know the spell <em>Alohomora.</em>"</p>
<p>"I <em>see,</em>" said Professor Quirrell. "Oh, dear. I wish you
had thought to mention this to me a good deal earlier."</p>
<p>Neither of them needed to state aloud the obvious, that this bit
of reverse reverse psychology had successfully ensured that Harry
would stay the heck away from Dumbledore's forbidden corridor.</p>
<p>Harry was still concentrating. "Do you think Dumbledore suspects
that I am, in his terms, a horcrux of Lord Voldemort, or more
generally, that some aspects of my personality were copied off Lord
Voldemort?" Even as Harry asked this aloud, he realized what a dumb
question it was, and how much completely blatant evidence he'd
already seen that -</p>
<p>"Dumbledore cannot <em>possibly</em> have missed it," said
Professor Quirrell. "It is not exactly subtle. What else is
Dumbledore to think, that you are an actor in a play whose stupid
author has never met a real eleven-year-old? Only a gibbering
dullard would believe that - ah, never mind."</p>
<p>The two of them stared at the Mirror in silence.</p>
<p>Finally Professor Quirrell sighed. "I have outwitted myself, I
fear. Neither you nor I dare be reflected in this Mirror. I suppose
I must command Professor Sprout to undo my Obliviations of Mr. Nott
and Miss Greengrass... You see, the other great difficulty of the
Mirror is that the rule by which it treats those reflected will
disregard external forces, such as False Memories or a Confundus
Charm. The Mirror reflects only those forces arising from within
the person themselves, the states of mind they arrive at through
their own choices; so it is said in several places. That is why I
had Mr. Nott and Miss Greengrass, believing different stories about
why the Stone's extraction was necessary, ready to appear before
this Mirror." Professor Quirrell rubbed at the bridge of his nose.
"I constructed other stories for other students, ready for me to
set into motion with the chosen trigger... but as this day
approached, I began to feel pessimistic about the project. Such as
Nott and Greengrass still seem worth trying, if we cannot think of
something better. But I wonder if Dumbledore has tried to construct
this puzzle to specifically resist Voldemort's cunning. I wonder if
he might have succeeded. If you devise an alternative plan which I
approve enough to try, <em>I promisse that whatever pawn I ssend
forth sshall not be harmed by me, then or ever; nor do I expect to
break that promisse</em>. And I remind you again of the hostages I
hold to my failure, both Miss Granger and all the others."</p>
<p>Again they stared at the mirror in silence, the elder Tom Riddle
and the younger.</p>
<p>"I suspect, Professor," Harry said after a time, "that your
entire class of hypotheses about somebody needing to want the Stone
for good or honest purposes is mistaken. The Headmaster wouldn't
set a retrieval rule like that."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because Dumbledore knows how easy it is to end up believing
that you're doing the right thing when you're actually not. It'd be
the first possibility he imagined."</p>
<p>"<em>Iss it truth or trickery that I hear?</em> "</p>
<p>"<em>Am being honesst,</em>" Harry said.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell nodded. "Then your point is well taken."</p>
<p>"I'm not sure why you think this puzzle is solvable," Harry
said. "Just set a rule like, your left hand must hold a small blue
pyramid and two large red pyramids, and your right hand must be
squeezing mayonnaise onto a hamster -"</p>
<p>"No," Professor Quirrell said. "No, I think not. The legends are
unclear on what rules can be given, but I think it must have
something to do with the Mirror's original intended use - it must
have something to do with the deep desires and wishes arising from
within the person. Squeezing mayonnaise onto a hamster will not
qualify as that, for most people."</p>
<p>"Huh," Harry said. "Maybe the rule is that the person has to not
want to use the Stone at all - no, that's too easy, the story you
gave Mr. Nott solves it."</p>
<p>"In some ways you may understand Dumbledore better than I," said
Professor Quirrell. "So now I ask you this: how would Dumbledore
use his notion of the acceptance of death to guard this Stone? For
that above all he thinks I cannot comprehend, and he is not far
wrong."</p>
<p>Harry thought about this for a while, considering several ideas
and discarding them. And then, having thought of something, Harry
considered remaining silent... before mapping out the obvious part
of the future conversation where Professor Quirrell asked him to
say in Parseltongue if he'd thought of something.</p>
<p>Reluctantly, Harry spoke. "Would Dumbledore think that this
Mirror could reach the afterlife? Could he put the Stone into
something that he <em>thinks</em> is an afterlife, so that only
people who believe in an afterlife can see it?"</p>
<p>"Hm..." Professor Quirrell said. "Possibly... yes, there is a
certain plausibility to it. Using this setting of the Mirror to
show people their heart's desires... Albus Dumbledore would see
himself reunited with his family. He would see himself united with
them <em>in death,</em> wanting to die himself rather than wishing
for them to be returned to life. His brother Aberforth, his sister
Ariana, his parents Kendra and Percival... it would be Aberforth to
whom Dumbledore gave the Stone, I think. Would the Mirror recognize
that Aberforth particularly had been given the Stone? Or will any
person's dead relative do, if that person believes their relative's
spirit would give them back the Stone?" Professor Quirrell was
pacing in a short circle, keeping well away from Harry and the
Mirror as he moved. "But all this is only one idea. Let us devise
another."</p>
<p>Harry began to tap his cheek, then stopped abruptly as he
realized where he'd picked up that gesture. "What if Perenelle is
the one who put the Stone in here? Maybe she keyed the Mirror to
give the Stone only to the person who put it in originally."</p>
<p>"Perenelle has lived this long by knowing her limitations," said
Professor Quirrell. "She does not overestimate her own intellect,
she is not prideful, if that were so she would have lost the Stone
long ago. Perenelle will not try to think of a good Mirror-rule
herself, not when Master Flamel can leave the matter in
Dumbledore's wiser hands... but the rule of only returning the
Stone to the one who remembers placing it, also works if Dumbledore
himself has placed the Stone. It would be a hard rule to bypass,
since I cannot simply Confund someone into believing that they put
in the Stone... I would have to create a false Stone, and a false
Mirror, and arrange the drama..." Professor Quirrell was frowning,
now. "But it is still something that Dumbledore would imagine
Voldemort being able to arrange, given time. If at all possible,
Dumbledore will want to make the key to the Mirror a state of mind
he thinks I <em>cannot</em> arrange in a pawn - or a rule that
Dumbledore thinks Voldemort can never comprehend, such as a rule
involving the acceptance of one's own death. That is why I
considered your previous idea plausible."</p>
<p>Then Harry had an idea.</p>
<p>He was not sure if it was a good idea.</p>
<p>...it wasn't like Harry had a lot of choice here.</p>
<p>"Arguendo," Harry said. "We're not sure what's necessary to
retrieve the Stone. But a <em>sufficient</em> condition should
involve Albus Dumbledore, or maybe someone else, in a state of mind
where they believe that the Dark Lord has been defeated, that the
threat is over, and that it is time to take out the Stone and give
it back to Nicholas Flamel. We aren't sure which part of that
person's state of mind, let's say Dumbledore's, will be the
necessary part that he thinks Lord Voldemort can't understand or
duplicate; but under those conditions Dumbledore's entire state of
mind will be <em>sufficient.</em>"</p>
<p>"Reasonable," said Professor Quirrell. "So?"</p>
<p>"The corresponding strategy," Harry said carefully, "is to mimic
Dumbledore's state of mind under those conditions, in as much
detail as possible, while standing in front of the mirror. And this
state of mind must have been produced by internal forces, not
external ones."</p>
<p>"But how are we to get that without Legilimency or the Confundus
Charm, both of which would certainly be external - ha. I
<em>see.</em>" Professor Quirrell's ice-pale eyes were suddenly
piercing. "You suggest that I Confund <em>myself,</em> as you cast
that hex upon yourself during your first day in Battle Magic. So
that it is an internal force and not an external one, a state of
mind that comes about through only my own choices. Say to me
whether you have made this suggestion with the intention of
trapping me, boy. Say it to me in Parseltongue."</p>
<p>"<em>My mind that you assked to devisse sstrategy may perhapss
have been influenced by ssuch an intent - who knowss? Knew you
would be ssusspiciouss, assk thiss very question. Decission is up
to you, teacher. I know nothing you do not know, about whether
thiss iss likely to trap you. Do not call it betrayal by me if you
choosse thiss for yoursself, and it failss.</em>" Harry felt a
strong impulse to smile, and suppressed it.</p>
<p>"Lovely," said Professor Quirrell, who <em>was</em> smiling. "I
suppose there are some threats from an inventive mind that even
questioning in Parseltongue cannot neutralize."</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /></p>
<p>Harry put on the Cloak of Invisibility, at Professor Quirrell's
orders, to <em>sstop the man who sshall believe himsself to be
sschoolmasster from sseeing you,</em> as Professor Quirrell said in
Parseltongue.</p>
<p>"Wearing the Cloak or no, you will stand in range of the Mirror
yourself," Professor Quirrell said. "If a gush of lava comes forth,
you will also burn. I feel that much symmetry should apply."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell pointed to a spot near the right of the door
through which they'd entered the room, before the Mirror and well
back of it. Harry, wearing the Cloak, went to where Professor
Quirrell had pointed him, and did not argue. It was increasingly
unclear to Harry whether both Riddles dying here would be a bad
thing, even with hundreds of other student hostages at stake. For
all of Harry's good intentions, he'd mostly shown himself so far to
be an idiot, and the returned Lord Voldemort was a threat to the
entire world.</p>
<p>(Though either way, Harry couldn't see Dumbledore doing the lava
thing. Dumbledore was probably sufficiently angry at Voldemort to
discard his usual restraint, but lava wouldn't permanently stop an
entity that Dumbledore believed to be a discorporate soul.)</p>
<p>Then Professor Quirrell pointed with his wand, and a shimmering
circle appeared around where Harry was standing on the floor. This,
Professor Quirrell said, would soon become a Greater Circle of
Concealment, by which nothing within that circle could be heard or
seen from the outside. Harry would not be able to make himself
apparent to the false Dumbledore by taking off the Cloak, nor by
shouting.</p>
<p>"You <em>will not</em> cross this circle once it is active,"
Professor Quirrell said. "That would cause you to touch my magic,
and while Confunded I might not remember how to halt the resonance
that would destroy us both. And further, since I do not want you
throwing shoes -" Professor Quirrell made another gesture, and just
within the Greater Circle of Concealment, a slight shimmer appeared
in the air, a globe-shaped distortion. "<em>Thiss barrier will
explode if touched, by you or other material thing.</em> The
resonance might lash at me afterward, but you would also be dead.
Now tell me in Parseltongue that you do not intend to cross this
circle or take off your Cloak or do <em>anything</em> at all
impulsive or stupid. Tell you me you will wait quietly here, under
the Cloak, until this is over."</p>
<p>This Harry repeated back.</p>
<p>Then Professor Quirrell's robes became black tinged with gold,
such robes as Dumbledore might wear upon a formal occasion; and
Professor Quirrell pointed his own wand at his head.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell stayed motionless for a long time, still
holding his wand to his head. His eyes were closed in
concentration.</p>
<p>And then Professor Quirrell said, "<em>Confundus.</em>"</p>
<p>At once the expression of the man standing there changed; he
blinked a few times as though confused, lowering his wand.</p>
<p>A deep weariness spread over the face Professor Quirrell had
worn; without any visible change his eyes seemed older, the few
lines in his face calling attention to themselves.</p>
<p>His lips were set in a sad smile.</p>
<p>Without any hurry, the man quietly walked over to the Mirror, as
though he had all the time in the world.</p>
<p>He crossed into the Mirror's range of reflection without
anything happening, and stared into the surface.</p>
<p>What the man might be seeing there, Harry could not tell; to
Harry it seemed that the flat, perfect surface still reflected the
room behind it, like a portal to another place.</p>
<p>"Ariana," breathed the man. "Mother, father. And you, my
brother, it is done."</p>
<p>The man stood still, as if listening.</p>
<p>"Yes, done," the man said. "Voldemort came before this mirror,
and was trapped by Merlin's method. He is only one more sealed
horror now."</p>
<p>Again the listening stillness.</p>
<p>"I would that I could obey you, my brother, but it is better
this way." The man bowed his head. "He is denied his death,
forever; that vengeance is terrible enough."</p>
<p>Harry felt a twinge, watching this, a sense that this was
<em>not</em> what Dumbledore would have said, it seemed more like a
strawman, a shallow stereotype... but then this wasn't the real
Aberforth's spirit either, this was who Professor Quirrell imagined
Dumbledore imagined Aberforth was, and that doubly-reflected image
of Aberforth wouldn't notice anything amiss...</p>
<p>"It is time to give back the Philosopher's Stone," said the man
who thought he was Dumbledore. "It must go back into Master
Flamel's keeping, now."</p>
<p>Listening stillness.</p>
<p>"No," said the man, "Master Flamel has kept it safe these many
years from all who would seek immortality, and I think it will be
safest in his hands... no, Aberforth, I do think his intentions are
good."</p>
<p>Harry couldn't control the tension that was running through him
like a live wire; he was having trouble breathing. Imperfect,
Professor Quirrell's Confundus Charm had been imperfect. The
underlying personality of Professor Quirrell was leaking through
and seeing the obvious question, why it was okay for Nicholas
Flamel himself to have the Stone if immortality was so awful. Even
if Professor Quirrell conceptualized Dumbledore as being blind to
the question, Professor Quirrell hadn't included a clause in the
Confundus saying that <em>Dumbledore's image of Aberforth</em>
wouldn't think of it; and all of this was ultimately a reflection
of Professor Quirrell's own mind, an image from within the
intelligence of Tom Riddle...</p>
<p>"Destroy it?" said the man. "Maybe. I am not sure it
<em>can</em> be destroyed, or Master Flamel would have done it long
since. I think, many times, that he has regretted making it...
Aberforth, I promised him, and we are not so ancient or so wise
ourselves. The Philosopher's Stone must go back into the keeping of
the one who made it."</p>
<p>And Harry's breath stopped.</p>
<p>The man was holding an irregular chunk of scarlet glass in his
left hand, the size perhaps of Harry's thumb from fingernail to the
first joint. The sheened surface of the scarlet glass made it seem
wet; the appearance was of blood, suspended in time and made into a
jagged surface.</p>
<p>"Thank you, my brother," the man said quietly.</p>
<p><em>Is that what the Stone should look like? Does Professor
Quirrell know what the true Stone should look like? Will the Mirror
give back the real Stone under these conditions, or make an
imitation and return that?</em></p>
<p>And then -</p>
<p>"No, Ariana," the man said, smiling gently, "I fear I must go
now. Be patient, my dearest, it will be soon enough that I join you
in truth... why? Why, I am not sure why I must go... when I hold
the Stone I am to step aside from the Mirror and wait for Master
Flamel to contact me, but I am not sure why I need to step aside
from the Mirror to do that..." The man sighed. "Ah, I am getting
old. It is well this dreadful war ended when it did. I suppose
there is no harm if I speak to you for a time, my dearest, if you
wish it so."</p>
<p>A headache was starting behind Harry's eyes; some part of Harry
was trying to send a message about not having breathed in a while,
but no one was listening. <em>Imperfect</em>, Professor Quirrell's
Confundus Charm had been imperfect, Professor Quirrell's image of
Dumbledore's image of Ariana wanted to talk to Dumbledore, and
maybe didn't want to wait because Professor Quirrell knew on some
level that there wasn't really an afterlife, and the previously
implanted impulse to leave after getting the Stone <em>wasn't
standing up to Riddle-Ariana's arguments...</em></p>
<p>And then Harry felt himself become very calm. He started
breathing again.</p>
<p>Either way, there wasn't much Harry could do about it. Professor
Quirrell had stopped Harry from intervening; well, Professor
Quirrell was welcome to reap the consequences of that decision. If
the consequences caught Harry as well, so be it.</p>
<p>The man who thought he was Dumbledore was mostly nodding
patiently, sometimes replying to his dearest sister. Sometimes the
man cast an uneasy look to one side; as if feeling a strong impulse
to go, but suppressing that impulse with the great patience and
politeness and concern for his sister that Professor Quirrell
imagined Albus Dumbledore having.</p>
<p>Harry saw it the instant the Confundus wore off, and the man's
expression changed, becoming again the face of Professor
Quirrell.</p>
<p>And in the same instant the Mirror changed, no longer showing
Harry the reflection of the room, showing instead the form of the
real Albus Dumbledore, as though he were standing just behind the
Mirror and visible through it.</p>
<p>The real Dumbledore's face was set, and grim.</p>
<p>"Hello, Tom," said Albus Dumbledore.</p>

<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 110: Reflections, Pt 2<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>The grimness on Albus Dumbledore's face lasted only an instant
before giving way to bewilderment. "Quirinus? What -"</p>
<p>And then there was a pause.</p>
<p>"Well," said Albus Dumbledore. "I do feel stupid."</p>
<p>"I should hope so," Professor Quirrell said easily; if he had
been at all shocked himself at being caught, it did not show. A
casual wave of his hand changed his robes back to a Professor's
clothing.</p>
<p>Dumbledore's grimness had returned and redoubled. "There I am,
searching so hard for Voldemort's shade, never noticing that the
Defense Professor of Hogwarts is a sickly, half-dead victim
possessed by a spirit far more powerful than himself. I would call
it senility, if so many others had not missed it as well."</p>
<p>"Quite," said Professor Quirrell. He lifted his eyebrows.
"Really, am I that hard to recognise without the glowing red
eyes?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes indeed," Albus Dumbledore said in level tones. "Your
acting was perfect; I confess myself utterly deceived. Quirinus
Quirrell seemed - what is the term I am looking for? Ah yes, that
is the word. He seemed sane."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell chuckled; he looked for all the world as
though the two of them were just having a casual conversation. "I
never was insane, you know. Lord Voldemort was just another game
for me, the same as Professor Quirrell."</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore did not look like he was enjoying a casual
chat. "I thought you might say that. I regret to inform you, Tom,
that anyone who can bring himself to act the part of Voldemort
<em>is</em> Voldemort."</p>
<p>"Ah," said Professor Quirrell, raising an admonishing finger.
"There is a loophole in that reasoning, old man. Anyone who acts
the part of Voldemort must be what moralists call 'evil', on this
we agree. But perhaps the real me is completely, utterly,
irredeemably evil in an interestingly different fashion from what I
was pretending with Voldemort -"</p>
<p>"I find," Albus Dumbledore ground out, "that I do not care."</p>
<p>"Then you must think yourself to be rid of me very soon," said
Professor Quirrell. "How interesting. My immortal existence must
depend on discovering what trap you have set, and finding a way to
escape from it, as soon as possible." Professor Quirrell paused.
"But let us pointlessly delay to talk of other matters first. How
did you come to be waiting inside the Mirror? I thought you would
be elsewhere."</p>
<p>"I am there," Albus Dumbledore said, "and <em>also</em> inside
the Mirror, unfortunately for you. I have always been here, all
along."</p>
<p>"Ah," said Professor Quirrell, and sighed. "I suppose my little
distraction was for naught, then."</p>
<p>And the rage of Albus Dumbledore was no longer leashed.
"<em>Distraction?</em> " roared Dumbledore, his sapphire eyes tight
with fury. "<em>You killed Master Flamel for a
distraction?</em> "</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell looked dismayed. "I am wounded by the
injustice of your accusation. I did not kill the one you know as
Flamel. I simply commanded another to do so."</p>
<p>"<em>How could you? Even you, how could you? He was the library
of all our lore! Secrets you have forever lost to
wizardry!</em> "</p>
<p>There was an edge to Professor Quirrell's smile, now. "You know,
I still do not comprehend how your twisted mind can consider it
acceptable for Flamel to be immortal, but when I try for the same
it makes me a monster."</p>
<p>"Master Flamel never descended into <em>immortality!</em> He -"
Dumbledore choked. "He only stayed awake past his evening, for our
sakes, through his long, long day -"</p>
<p>"I don't know if you recall this," Professor Quirrell said, his
voice airy, "but do you recall that day in your office with Tom
Riddle? The one where I begged you, where I went down on my knees
and begged you, to introduce me to Nicholas Flamel so that I could
ask to become his apprentice, to someday make for myself the
Philosopher's Stone? That was my last attempt to be a good person,
if you are curious. You told me no, and gave me a lecture on how
unvirtuous it was to be afraid of death. I went from your office in
bitterness and in fury. I reasoned that if I was to be called evil
in any case, just for not wanting to die, then I might as well be
evil; and one month later I killed Abigail Myrtle to pursue
immortality by other means. Even when I knew more of Flamel, I
remained quite put out with your hypocrisy; and for that reason I
tormented you and yours more than I otherwise would have done. I
have often felt that you ought to know this, but we never had a
chance to talk frankly."</p>
<p>"I decline," said Albus Dumbledore, whose gaze did not waver. "I
do not accept the tiniest shred of responsibility for what you have
become. That was all, entirely, you and your own decisions."</p>
<p>"I am not surprised to hear you say that," said Professor
Quirrell. "Well, now I am curious as to what responsibilities you
do accept. You have access to some unusual power of Divination;
that much I deduced long ago. You made too many nonsensical moves,
and the paths by which they worked out in your favor were too
ridiculous. So tell me. Were you forewarned of the result, that
night of All Hallow's Eve when I was vanquished for a time?"</p>
<p>"I knew," said Albus Dumbledore, his voice low and cold. "For
that, I accept responsibility, which is something you will never
understand."</p>
<p>"You arranged for Severus Snape to hear the Prophecy that he
brought to me."</p>
<p>"I allowed it to happen," said Albus Dumbledore.</p>
<p>"And there I was, all excited at having finally gained my own
foreknowledge." Professor Quirrell shook his head as though in
sadness. "So the great hero Dumbledore sacrificed his unwitting
pawns, Lily and James Potter, merely to banish me for a few
years."</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore's eyes were like stones. "James and Lily would
have gone willingly to the death, if they had known."</p>
<p>"And the little baby?" Professor Quirrell said. "Somehow I doubt
the Potters would have been so eager to leave him in the path of
You-Know-Who."</p>
<p>You could scarcely see the flinch. "The Boy-Who-Lived came out
of it well enough. Tried to turn him into <em>you</em>, did you?
Instead you turned yourself into a corpse, and Harry Potter became
the wizard you should have been." Now there was something like the
usual Dumbledore behind the half-moon glasses, a tiny twinkle in
those eyes. "All of Tom Riddle's icy brilliance, tamed to the
service of James and Lily's warmth and love. I wonder how you felt
when you saw what Tom Riddle could have become, if he had grown up
in a loving family?"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's lips quirked. "I was surprised, even
shocked, by the abyssal depths of Mr. Potter's naivete."</p>
<p>"I suppose the humor of the situation would be lost on you." It
was then, finally, that Albus Dumbledore smiled. "How I laughed
when I realised it! When I saw you had made a Good Voldemort to
oppose the evil one - ah, how I laughed! I never had the steel for
my role, but Harry Potter shall be more than equal to it, when he
comes into his power." Albus Dumbledore's smile disappeared.
"Though I suppose Harry shall have to find some other Dark Lord to
vanquish for it, since you will not be there."</p>
<p>"Ah, yes. That." Professor Quirrell made to walk away from the
Mirrror, and seemed to halt just before reaching the point where
the Mirror would no longer have reflected him, if it had been
reflecting him. "Interesting."</p>
<p>Dumbledore's smile was colder, now. "No, Tom. You are not going
anywhere."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell nodded. "What have you done, exactly?"</p>
<p>"You have refused death," said Dumbledore, "and if I destroyed
your body, your spirit would only wander back, like a dumb animal
that cannot understand it is being sent away. So I am sending you
outside Time, to a frozen instant from which neither I nor any
other can return you. Perhaps Harry Potter will be able to retrieve
you someday, if prophecy speaks true. He may wish to discuss with
you just who is at fault for the deaths of his parents. For you it
will only be an instant - if you ever return at all. Either way,
Tom, I wish you the best of it."</p>
<p>"Hm," said Professor Quirrell. The Defense Professor had paced
past where Harry stood, watching mute and with something like
horror, only to halt again at the other edge of the mirror. "As I
suspected. You are using Merlin's old method of sealing, what the
tale of Topherius Chang names as the Process of the Timeless. If
legend speaks true, not even you can stop the process, now that it
has been in motion this long."</p>
<p>"Indeed," said Albus Dumbledore. But his eyes were suddenly
wary.</p>
<p>And Harry, from where he stood just before and to the right of
the door, waiting in silence and controlled terror, could feel it
in the air; he could feel the sense of a <em>presence</em>
gathering within the Mirror's field. Something more alien than
magic, everything about it incomprehensible except for the fact of
its strangeness and the fact of its power. It had been slow but now
it was waxing faster, that presence.</p>
<p>"But you could still reverse the effect, if Chang's account is
true," said Professor Quirrell. "Most powers of the Mirror are
double-sided, according to legend. So you could banish what is on
the other side of the Mirror instead. Send yourself, instead of me,
into that frozen instant. If you wanted to, that is."</p>
<p>"And why would I do that?" Albus Dumbledore's voice was tight.
"I suppose you are going to tell me that you have taken hostages?
That was futile, Tom, you <em>fool!</em> You utter <em>fool!</em>
You should have known that I would give you nothing for any
hostages you had taken."</p>
<p>"You always were one step too slow," said Professor Quirrell.
"Allow me to introduce you to my hostage."</p>
<p>Another presence invaded the air around Harry, a crawling
sensation all over his flesh as another Tom Riddle's magic passed
very close to his skin. The Cloak of Invisibility was torn away
from him, and the shimmering black Cloak flew away from him,
through the air.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell caught it, and swiftly drew it over himself;
in less than a second he had pulled down the Cloak's hood over his
head, and disappeared.</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore staggered, as though some essential support had
been removed from him.</p>
<p>"Harry Potter," the Headmaster breathed. "<em>What are you doing
here?</em> "</p>
<p>Harry stared at the image of Albus Dumbledore, on whose face
utter shock and utter dismay were warring.</p>
<p>The guilt and the shame were too much, too much, hitting Harry
all at once, and he could feel the incomprehensible presence around
him rising to a peak. Harry knew without words that there was no
time left, and that he was done.</p>
<p>"It's my fault," Harry said in a tiny voice, from whatever part
of him had taken over his throat in the final extremity. "I was
stupid. I've always been stupid. You mustn't rescue me.
Goodbye."</p>
<p>"Why, look at that," sang out Professor Quirrell's voice from
the empty air, "I don't seem to have a reflection any more."</p>
<p>"No," said Albus Dumbledore. "No, no, <em>NO!</em> "</p>
<p>Into the hand of the Albus Dumbledore flew from his sleeve his
long, dark-grey wand, and in his other hand, as though from
nowhere, appeared a short rod of dark stone.</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore threw these both violently aside, just as the
building sense of power rose to an unbearable peak, and then
disappeared.</p>
<p>The Mirror returned to showing the ordinary reflection of a
gold-lit room of white stone, without any trace of where Albus
Dumbledore had been.</p>

<p>The Dark Lord was laughing.</p>
<p>From the empty air came the voice of the Defense Professor
laughing wildly, so high and terrible his laughter; it was
Voldemort's laughter now, the Dark Lord's laughter beyond all
hiding or restraint.</p>
<p>Harry's mind was disarrayed. His eyes kept staring at where
Albus Dumbledore had been. There was a horror in him that was too
huge for understanding or reflection. His mind kept trying to fall
back through time and undo reality, but that wasn't a sort of magic
that existed, and reality stayed the same.</p>
<p>He had lost, he had lost Dumbledore, there were no take-backs,
and that meant he had lost the war.</p>
<p>And the Dark Lord went on laughing.</p>
<p>"Ah, ah hah, ah hah hah ha! Professor Dumbledore, ah, Professor
Dumbledore, such a fitting end to our game!" Another burst of wild
laughter. "The wrong sacrifice even at the finish, for the piece
you gave up everything to save was already in my possession! The
wrong trap even from the beginning, for I could have abandoned this
body at any time! Ah, hahahahaha, aha! You never did learn cunning,
you poor old fool."</p>
<p>"You -" A voice was coming from Harry's throat. "You -"</p>
<p>"Ahahahaha! Why, yes, little child, you were always along on
this adventure as my hostage, it was your whole purpose in being
here. Ha, hahahaha! You are decades too young to play this game
against the real Tom Riddle, child." The Dark Lord drew back the
hood of the Cloak, his head becoming visible, and began to remove
the rest of the Cloak. "And now, boy, <em>you have helped me, yess
indeed, and so it iss time to ressurrect your girl-child friend. To
keep promisse.</em>" The Dark Lord's smile was cold, cold indeed.
"I suppose you have doubts? Mark well, I could kill you this
instant, for there is no longer a Headmaster of Hogwarts to be
informed of it. Doubt me all you wish, but remember that." The hand
was once more holding the gun. "Now come along, foolish child."</p>
<p>And they left.</p>
<p>They went back out through the door into the Potions room, the
Dark Lord banishing the returned purple fire with a stroke of his
wand. They went through the chamber where the boggart had been, and
the chamber of ruined chess statues, and through the burned door of
the chamber of keys. The Dark Lord floated up through the trapdoor,
and Harry struggled up afterward through the spiral staircase of
leaves, the tendrils of the Devil's Snare twitching and then moving
back as though afraid. The Boy-Who-Lived was trying hard not to
burst into tears, and his dark-side patterns weren't helping, maybe
because Voldemort had never known or dealt with guilt.</p>
<p>They passed the huge three-headed Inferi, and at a whispered
word from the Dark Lord it collapsed over the trapdoor and became a
corpse again.</p>
<p>They passed Severus Snape standing guard, who told them both
that he was guarding the door, and that they must leave or he would
deduct House points.</p>
<p>The Dark Lord spoke the words <em>"Hyakuju montauk"</em> without
pausing in his stride, accompanied by a jab of his wand; and
Severus staggered before he lifelessly drew himself up beside the
door once more.</p>
<p>"What -" Harry said, as he followed. "What did you -"</p>
<p>"Just fulfilling my obligation to my faithful servant. It shall
not kill him, as I promised you." The Dark Lord laughed again.</p>
<p>"The hostages -" Harry said. It was hard to keep his voice
steady. "The students, you said you'd stop whatever is going to
kill them -"</p>
<p>"<em>Yess. Sstop worrying. Will do on our way out.</em>"</p>
<p>"Out?"</p>
<p>"We are leaving, child." The Dark Lord was still smiling.</p>
<p>The bad feeling this raised was lost in a sea of other bad
feelings.</p>
<p>The Dark Lord was now consulting what he'd called the Hogwarts
Map, the handwritten lines upon it seeming to move as they walked.
Some part of Harry's mind that had been considering what to do if
they ran into Aurors on patrol (whom the Dark Lord could kill, or
Obliviate, in an instant) gave up that hope as well.</p>
<p>They went down the Grand Staircase to the second floor,
encountering no one.</p>
<p>The Dark Lord made a turn Harry did not know, and went down
another stair-flight. As they descended past one floor and another,
the windows stopped and the torches began, they were within the
Slytherin dungeons now.</p>
<p>Ahead, the form of a person in Hogwarts robes appeared.</p>
<p>The Dark Lord kept walking toward that person.</p>
<p>Harry followed.</p>
<p>A sixth or seventh-year Slytherin was waiting by a section of
wall that was set with an artistic carving of Salazar Slytherin
wielding his wand, against what looked like a giant covered in
icicles. The witch made no comment at seeing Professor Quirrell
walking upright, or seeing Harry in his company, or seeing the gun
in the Defense Professor's hand. If her eyes were blank, Harry
couldn't tell the difference.</p>
<p>The Dark Lord reached into his robes, took out a Knut, and
flipped it to her. "Klaudia Alicja Tabor, I command you thus. Take
this Knut to the spell circle I showed you beneath the Quidditch
stands and put it in the center. Then Obliviate yourself of the
last six hours."</p>
<p>"Yes, lord," the witch said, bowing to him, and went on her
way.</p>
<p>"I thought -" Harry said. "I thought you needed the Stone to
-"</p>
<p>The Dark Lord was still smiling, he had never stopped smiling.
"I did not say that part in Parseltongue, child. All I said in
Parseltongue was that I had set events in motion to kill students,
events that I would stop if I obtained the Stone. The rest was in
human speech. I would also have stopped the Blood Fort sacrifice if
I had not obtained the Stone, so long as I was not discovered and
restrained. The students of Hogwarts are a valuable resource, whom
I have already spent much time training." Then the Dark Lord hissed
to the wall, "<em>Open.</em>"</p>
<p>Harry's eyes saw the tiny snake that had been set in the
upper-left of the carving, even as the wall slowly swung backward,
revealing the opening of a huge pipe. Moss grew on its sides and a
musty dusty smell welled up from it; the interior was also covered
with cobwebs in multiple sheets.</p>
<p>"Spiders..." murmured the Dark Lord. He sighed, and for that
brief moment he sounded once more like Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>The Dark Lord walked into the huge pipe, the cobwebs burning
away before him. Harry, not seeing any other better options,
followed.</p>
<p>The pipe branched in a Y-shape, then branched again. The Dark
Lord went left, then right.</p>
<p>The pipe came to a solid metal wall. <em>"Open,"</em> the Dark
Lord hissed, and a crack appeared in the metal; it seemed to fold
into itself.</p>
<p>Beyond was the middle of a long, stone tunnel.</p>
<p>"We shall be walking a while," said the Dark Lord. "Did you have
more questions to ask, little child?"</p>
<p>"I - I can't think of any - right now -"</p>
<p>Another cold laugh replied to this, and they walked into the
tunnel, turning right.</p>
<p>Harry didn't know, then or ever, how long he walked; the light
of burning spiderwebs was too dim to read his mechanical watch, and
Harry had not thought to look at the time before entering. It felt
like they walked for miles, miles beneath the ground.</p>
<p>Slowly, Harry's mind tried to recover itself a final time. Very
possibly final, if he was right about the Dark Lord killing him
after this... though the Dark Lord had said that he would resurrect
Hermione, which seemed pointless if that was true... was that
simply the Dark Lord following through on a promise he would not
otherwise have been able to make in Parseltongue... why had he not
just shot Harry on the spot...</p>
<p><em>Seriously,</em> some last functioning part of his brain said
to all the other parts, <em>this would be a good time to think of
something, something that the Dark Lord has not already thought of,
something we can do without our pouch or our wand or our
Time-Turner, something that Professor Quirrell has not imagined we
can do... think, think, pretty pretty please think of something?
Don't shut down now, even if you're scared, even if we've never
really really faced death before in the sense of being about to die
in the next hour, THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO SHUT DOWN -</em></p>
<p>Harry's mind stayed blank.</p>
<p><em>Suppose,</em> said that last remaining part, <em>suppose we
try to condition on the fact that we win this, or at least get out
of this alive. If someone TOLD YOU AS A FACT that you had survived,
or even won, somehow made everything turn out okay, what would you
think had happened -</em></p>
<p><em>Not legitimate procedure,</em> whispered Ravenclaw, <em>the
universe doesn't work like that, we're just going to die.</em></p>
<p><em>Someone realises we're missing,</em> thought Hufflepuff,
<em>and Mad-Eye Moody shows up with a squad of Aurors and rescues
us. I think the time has come to admit we're not more competent
than the standard authorities.</em></p>
<p><em>The saving factor does have to be something we</em> do
<em>somehow,</em> said the last voice. <em>Otherwise there's no
point in our thinking about it.</em></p>
<p><em>Problem two,</em> said Gryffindor. <em>Harry Potter isn't
missing, he's right there at the Quidditch match where everyone can
see him. Professor Quirrell thought of that too, it's part of why
he sent that fake note. Problem three. I don't think Mad-Eye Moody
and an Auror squad can beat the Dark Lord, and certainly not before
he kills us. I'm not sure the entire DMLE can beat the Dark Lord if
he's fighting seriously and Dumbledore is gone. Problem four. The
Quidditch match was not disrupted, that's probably the only reason
why Professor Quirrell was willing to try something as complicated
as bringing us along on this trip in the first place.</em></p>
<p><em>Thinking along different lines,</em> ventured Slytherin<em>,
maybe Professor Quirrell calls in someone else to Memory-Charm
us</em>. <em>Legilimency, Imperius, Confundus, who knows what else,
we're not a perfect Occlumens. Then the Dark Lord would have a
smart - well, sort-of smart lieutenant that he could use. That
could be another reason why Professor Quirrell was so willing to
tell us secrets, if he knew that the memory would disappear. It's
also a reason to leave the Hogwarts wards, so the Dark Lord can
call Bellatrix to Apparate in and do the work...</em></p>
<p><em>This entire reasoning process is illegitimate and I refuse
to participate,</em> said Ravenclaw.</p>
<p><em>What lovely last words,</em> said the last voice. <em>Now
shut up and think.</em></p>
<p>Rough stone tunnel went by underfoot, Harry's shoes sometimes
dipping into moisture or nearly slipping on a curved surface. The
neurons in his brain, which kept on firing, imagined voices talking
to each other, yelling at each other, even as the Listener stayed
numb with horror and shame.</p>
<p>Gryffindor and Hufflepuff were conducting a debate about suicide
by charging the Dark Lord's gun, or by swallowing the little jewel
on Harry's steel ring. It seemed unclear whether the fate of the
world was better or worse if the Dark Lord had Harry as a
mind-slave; if the Dark Lord was going to win anyway, it might be
better if he won faster.</p>
<p>And the last voice kept talking through it all; even in the
depths of failure that last voice remained. <em>What else did the
Dark Lord always say in human speech and never in Parseltongue? Do
we remember? Anything like that, anything at all?</em></p>
<p>It was all too distant in time, too distant in time even though
it had all happened this very day. The Dark Lord had told him in
Parseltongue just now that it was time to revive Hermione, and then
he'd said other things all in English, Harry could hardly remember
for all that they'd just been spoken. Before then... before then
there'd been the Circle of Concealment, when Professor Quirrell had
hissed that the barrier would explode if touched. And the Defense
Professor had said in English for Harry not to take off his Cloak
or try crossing the Circle, said in English that the resonance
might strike Professor Quirrell afterwards but Harry would be dead.
Said in English that if Harry touched the magic and Professor
Quirrell didn't remember how to halt the resonance, it would kill
them both...</p>
<p><em>Suppose it doesn't kill us both,</em> said the last voice.
<em>On Halloween in Godric's Hollow, the Dark Lord's body was
burned and we only ended up with a scar on our forehead. Suppose
the resonance between us is deadlier to the Dark Lord than to us.
What if this entire time we've been able to kill the Dark Lord at
any time, just by dashing forward and touching our hands to any
part of his exposed skin? And then it makes our scar bleed again,
but that's all. The sense of 'stop, don't do that' is inherited
from the Dark Lord's worst memory of his mistake in Godric's
Hollow, it may not actually apply to the Boy-Who-Lived.</em></p>
<p>A small note of hope rose.</p>
<p>Rose, and was quashed.</p>
<p><em>The Dark Lord can just throw away his wand,</em> droned
Ravenclaw. <em>Professor Quirrell can turn into his Animagus form.
Even if he dies the Dark Lord will possess someone else and return,
and then torture our parents, to punish us.</em></p>
<p><em>We might be able to get to our parents in time,</em> said
the last voice. <em>We might be able to hide them. We might be able
to get the Philosopher's Stone away from the Dark Lord if we killed
his current body now, and that Stone could provide the nucleus of a
counter-army.</em></p>
<p>The Dark Lord was moving on through the stony corridor. His hand
still held the gun. He was at least four meters away from
Harry.</p>
<p><em>If we dart forward, he will sense us approaching through the
resonance,</em> said Hufflepuff. <em>He will fly forward rapidly,
he can do that, he has the broomstick-enchantments that let him
fly. He will fly forward, turn around, and fire the gun. He knows
about the resonance, he's thought of this already. This is not
something the Dark Lord has failed to consider. He will be ready
for it, and waiting.</em></p>
<p><em>Continuing the same line of argument,</em> said the last
voice. <em>Suppose we can freely cast magic on Professor Quirrell
but he can't cast it on us.</em></p>
<p><em>Why would that be true?</em> demanded Ravenclaw. <em>In
fact, we have evidence that it's false.</em> <em>In Azkaban, when
Professor Quirrell's Avada Kedavra hit our Patronus Charm, it felt
like our head was splitting apart -</em></p>
<p><em>Suppose that was all</em> his <em>magic going out of
control. Suppose if we'd just cast, say, a Luminos targeting him,
nothing bad would have happened.</em></p>
<p><em>But why?</em> said Ravenclaw. <em>Why suppose that?</em></p>
<p><em>Because,</em> thought Harry, <em>it explains why Professor
Quirrell didn't</em> warn me <em>not to cast any magic on him in
Azkaban. Because Professor Quirrell never said in Parseltongue,
that I can remember, that I'd hurt myself if I tried to cast magic
on him. He could have given me that warning, but he didn't, even
though he gave me a lot of other warnings. Absence of evidence is
weak evidence of absence.</em></p>
<p>There was a pause while Harry's parts considered this.</p>
<p><em>We don't actually have our wand,</em> said Ravenclaw.</p>
<p><em>We might get it back at some point,</em> thought the last
voice.</p>
<p><em>But even then,</em> Harry thought, and the grey hopelessness
returned, <em>the resonance is something the Dark Lord knows about.
He's already thought of everything I can do with that, he already
has a response prepared. That was my mistake from the beginning. I
didn't respect the Dark Lord's intelligence, I didn't think that
maybe he knew everything I knew and could see everything I saw and
had already taken it into account.</em></p>
<p><em>Then,</em> said the last voice, <em>conditional on our
winning, we must have hit him with something he doesn't know
about.</em></p>
<p><em>Dementors,</em> offered Gryffindor.</p>
<p><em>The Dark Lord</em> knows <em>we can destroy, deflect, and
possibly control Dementors,</em> said Ravenclaw. <em>He doesn't
know how, but he knows we have the capability, and where the heck
would we get a Dementor anyway?</em></p>
<p>Maybe, ventured Hufflepuff, <em>the Dark Lord's whole horcrux
system would short out via the resonance if we grabbed him and held
him, sacrificing our own life to destroy him forever.</em></p>
<p><em>Bullhockey,</em> said Ravenclaw. <em>But I guess it doesn't
hurt to engage in some pleasant fantasy before we die, no matter
how stupid.</em></p>
<p><em>If Lord Voldemort had a strong enough fear of death,</em>
Hufflepuff argued, <em>if he</em> <em>wanted strongly enough to
just not need to think about death again, then the horcrux
system</em> could <em>have design flaws like that. It never
occurred to Voldemort to test his horcruxes on someone else, that
could indicate he wasn't able to think about the subject clearly
-</em></p>
<p><em>So his fear of death is his fatal weakness?</em> said
Ravenclaw. <em>Yeah, no. I'm thinking someone with over a hundred
horcruxes might have a few failsafe mechanisms in there.</em></p>
<p>And Harry's brain went on thinking.</p>
<p>A genuine asymmetry in the magical resonance between them...
seemed improbable, there was no reason for the magical effect to
work like that. But the magical backlash could hit the stronger
wizard harder, the more powerful magic resonating more dangerously.
That could explain the observed event in Godric's Hollow (Voldemort
explodes, baby survives), and also explain the observed event in
Azkaban (Voldemort severely impaired by backlash of his strong
magic, first-year Boy-Who-Lived hit by lighter backlash of his weak
magic). Or if it was only the caster's magic that resonated, that
could also explain both those two observations. That might even
explain why Professor Quirrell had been in no rush to warn Harry
against casting any magic on him. Though there was another obvious
reason why Professor Quirrell would avoid raising the subject of
the resonance; it was a gigantic hint about the mystery of Godric's
Hollow, if Harry had ever made the connection.</p>
<p>The part that was numb with grief and guilt took this
opportunity to observe, speaking of obliviousness, that after
events at Hogwarts had turned serious, they really really
<em>really REALLY</em> should have reconsidered the decision made
on First Thursday, at the behest of Professor McGonagall, <em>not
to tell Dumbledore about the sense of doom that Harry got around
Professor Quirrell.</em> It was true that Harry hadn't been sure
who to trust, there was a long stretch where it had seemed
plausible that Dumbledore was the bad guy and Professor Quirrell
the heroic opposition, but...</p>
<p>Dumbledore would have realised.</p>
<p>Dumbledore would have realised instantly.</p>
<p>The wise old wizard with the true phoenix on his shoulder would
have known, and Harry hadn't trusted him, Harry hadn't told him all
the relevant facts, and the reason for this had been sheer neglect
to reconsider a cached decision made four days into the start of
the school year. It had been marked 'something not to tell
Dumbledore' and even after Azkaban, even after Hermione died, even
after everything, Harry had simply forgot to promote the question
to deliberation and reconsider the tradeoff.</p>
<p>Another wave of grief and shame washed over Harry, and for a
time he walked on in the silence of the last voice, other voices
being happy enough to fill the gap.</p>
<p>After what was at least several miles, and many grey thoughts,
the stone tunnel ended.</p>
<p>The Dark Lord climbed up stone steps, and Harry followed
after.</p>
<p>The two of them came into a dark, dank stone building. Dirty old
stone doors swung open without being touched.</p>
<p>Before them lay marble slabs, rising up from bare ground, upon
them names and dates. The tombstones were scattered in nothing like
neat rows, and the rest of the graveyard ran wild.</p>
<p>The moon above was over three-quarters full, already seeming
bright with night not fully fallen.</p>
<p>Harry had stopped walking upon seeing the graveyard. There was a
blaring alarm in his brain saying to be <em>anywhere other than
here,</em> but there weren't any options for accomplishing that. So
that alarm cried unanswered, even as behind Harry the stone doors
of the mausoleum swung shut again and sealed themselves.</p>
<p>The Dark Lord came into the center of the scattered graveyard.
He stopped walking, and waved his wand above his head in a small
circle.</p>
<p>There was a rumbling sound, and smoothly from the ground rose an
altar, at least two meters wide and of black stone carved with grey
sigils. And then surrounding the altar groaned up six dark-marble
obelisks, regularly spaced, gleaming darkly beneath the fading
twilight sky.</p>
<p>The unanswerable alarm in Harry's brain grew louder.</p>
<p>"This," said the Dark Lord in Professor Quirrell's cadences, "is
a workspace I made for myself, convenient to either Hogwarts or
Hogsmeade." The Dark Lord flourished a hand at the altar. "That is
where Miss Granger shall revive, and also where I shall be reborn
into my true body. I shall remake myself first, of course.
<em>Magicss to revive girl-child eassier with true body.</em>" A
strange snakish laughter accompanied these words. "<em>Resst
asssured that though ssome asspects of girl-child'ss ressurrection
sshall be what otherss conssider Dark, girl-child will not be
harmed or made ugly by it. Sshall sstill look like hersself, mind
sshall be her own, nor sshall I or mine harm her after."</em></p>
<p>Harry's tongue was dry and his mind was having trouble
functioning. "Please, Professor, would you say in Parseltongue what
is your real purpose in resurrecting Miss Granger?"</p>
<p>"<em>To resstore to you girl-child friend'ss counssel and
resstraint. To make ssure sshe iss part of the world for you to
care about. That, boy, iss truly the greater part of the reasson I
am doing thiss deed.</em>" Again snakish laughter accompanied these
words, conveying sardonic awareness of some vast irony.</p>
<p>A small spark of hope kindled inside Harry, alongside the much
greater note of confusion, and the fear that a perfect Occlumens
could indeed lie in Parseltongue. Harry didn't understand why the
Dark Lord was doing this, if the next step was just to kill the
Boy-Who-Lived or enslave him...</p>
<p>Maybe he'd just never understood Professor Quirrell at all,
maybe somehow Harry's model of Tom Riddle was just <em>that
wrong</em>... maybe the Boy-Who-Lived would be Obliviated of the
last day and dropped off somewhere with a confused Hermione
Granger, while Lord Voldemort went on to conquer the world...?</p>
<p>Hope flared up in Harry, but it was a confused hope that didn't
make any sense. It didn't square with the Dark Lord who had mocked
Dumbledore and laughed at his defeat. Harry couldn't come up with
any consistent account of Professor Quirrell's motives that allowed
for something like that.</p>
<p><em>I do not know what is meant to happen next.</em></p>
<p>The Dark Lord had moved forward to the altar. He knelt there,
and seemed to reach deep into the stone of the altar itself,
drawing forth a vial of liquid that looked black in the fading
twilight.</p>
<p>When the Dark Lord spoke again his voice was clipped and
precise. "Blood, blood, blood so wisely hidden," said the Dark
Lord.</p>
<p>And the obelisks surrounding the altar began to speak, voices
like a chanting chorus coming from the motionless stones, cadances
older than Latin.</p>
<p><em>Apokatastethi, apokatastethi, apokatastethi to soma mou
emoi.</em></p>
<p><em>Apokatastethi, apokatastethi, apokatastethi to soma mou
emoi.</em></p>
<p>The obelisks' chant echoed after the end of each line, as if
they were speaking out of synchrony with each other. The blood was
poured from the vial, and it seemed to catch and hang over the
altar, slowly expanding through the air, taking on a shape.</p>
<p><em>Apokatastethi, apokatastethi, apokatastethi to soma mou emoi
(emoi).</em></p>
<p><em>Apokatastethi, apokatastethi, apokatastethi to soma mou emoi
(emoi).</em></p>
<p>A tall form rested upon the altar, and even in the dimming
twilight it looked too pale.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor reached his hand into his robe, and drew
forth a small irregular chunk of red glass.</p>
<p>He placed that upon the tall pale body.</p>
<p>The Stone stayed there for a time, minutes at least. The
irregular chunk of red glass did not glow, or flash, or give any
other indication of power.</p>
<p>Then the Stone moved, just a little, turning slightly upon the
body.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor took back the Stone into his robes, and
prodded the tall form that lay motionless upon the altar, touching
the eyes with his fingers, poking the chest with his wand.</p>
<p>He threw back his head, then, and laughed.</p>
<p>"Incredible," said the Dark Lord, in the voice of the Defense
Professor that Harry had known. "Fixed, it is fixed in form! A mere
construct sustained by magic, become the true substance at the
Stone's touch! And yet I sensed nothing! Nothing! I feared I had
been deceived, that I had obtained a false Stone, but the substance
proves true to my every test!" The Defense Professor tucked the red
glass back into his robes. "That is eldritch even by my standards,
I admit."</p>
<p>Then the Defense Professor walked around the altar, five times
he walked around it, chanting something too low for Harry to
hear.</p>
<p>The Dark Lord placed his wand in the hand of the figure lying on
the altar.</p>
<p>He placed his hands, both of them, over the body's forehead.</p>
<p>The Dark Lord spoke. "<em>Fal. Tor. Pan."</em></p>
<p>Without any warning there was a flash like lightning that lit up
the entire graveyard, and Harry staggered back a step, his hands
involuntarily going to his forehead. It felt as if he had been shot
there, or a wasp stung him, upon his scar.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor collapsed.</p>
<p>And the too-tall figure sat up upon the altar.</p>
<p>It swung around smoothly, and stood tall upon the ground, at
least a head higher than a normal man. The form's limbs were lean
and pale, little-muscled but giving an impression of terrible
strength.</p>
<p>Harry took another staggering step back, his hands still clasped
to his scar. Though the distance between them was wide, Harry felt
a sense of terrifying apprehension in the air, as though the sense
of doom had always been been <em>out of focus</em> and had now
clarified, concentrated into a physical pain in the scar on Harry's
forehead.</p>
<p>Was that what Voldemort was <em>supposed</em> to look like? The
nose looked like, it looked like it had <em>malfunctioned</em>
during the resurrection process -</p>
<p>The too-tall figure threw back his head and laughed, raising his
hands and wand to look at them. The left hand opened wide and it
was like a pale half-spider with four over-long legs, fingers
caressing the wand held in the other hand. Leaves stirred up from
the graveyard, approaching to dance around the too-tall figure,
surrounding him and clothing him, reforming into a high-necked
shirt and flowing robes; and Lord Voldemort was laughing. Exactly
the mirthless laughter that Harry remembered coming from his own
throat inside the Dementor's nightmare, precise in tone and
timbre.</p>
<p>Red eyes gleamed beneath the fading twilight, their pupils
slitted like a cat's.</p>
<p>The form that Voldemort had abandoned raised itself, quivering,
from the ground; and in a voice that Harry could barely hear,
Quirinus Quirrell gasped, "Free - oh, free -"</p>
<p>"<em>Stupefy,</em>" said the high cold voice of Voldemort, and
Quirinus Quirrell was blasted down into the ground; then, with a
wave of Voldemort's other hand, Quirinus Quirrell was picked up and
flung away from the altar.</p>
<p>Voldemort walked away from the altar, then turned and looked at
Harry; and the pain in Harry's scar flared at it.</p>
<p>"Frightened, child?" Voldemort hissed, like there was an
undercurrent of Parseltongue even to the Dark Lord's human speech.
"Good. Place the girl on the altar, and break your Transfiguration.
<em>Iss time for me to revive her.</em>"</p>
<p><em>Is this really going to happen? Are we really going to do
this?</em></p>
<p>Harry swallowed, mastering his fear through that note of
impossible hope amid the confusion, and walked over to the altar.
Then Harry took off his left shoe, and his left sock, and took off
the toe-ring that was Hermione Granger, the Transfigured shape
identical to the toe-ring that had been given Harry as an emergency
portkey. There was a twinge of regret in Harry for not having the
real portkey now, but only a twinge; an inner-circle Death Eater
would routinely put up boundaries against portkeys, if Severus had
been right. Behind Harry, Voldemort laughed again in what sounded
like surprised appreciation.</p>
<p>"I need my wand to <em>Finite</em> her," Harry said aloud.</p>
<p>"You do <em>not</em>." High the voice and cruel. "You learned to
sustain a Transfiguration by touch alone, without further use of
the wand. You can likewise break your own Transfiguration
wandlessly, by commanding your sustaining magic to drain away. Do
so now."</p>
<p>Harry swallowed, and touched the toe-ring. He had to try three
times, and clear his mind, before he could push his magic out of
the toe-ring, as before he had learned to make a tiny stream of
magic flow in.</p>
<p>The breaking of the spell went much more slowly that way than a
<em>Finite Incantatem</em>, almost like the sped-up reverse of
watching something being Transfigured. The toe-ring distorted,
flowing together, expanding. Colors changed, textures changed.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of a dead girl lay strewn across the altar, on her
side with one arm falling off the altar's edge, the position in
which the reversion had chanced to place her. No blood flowed now
from the chewed stumps of her thighs. The dead girl wore Hermione
Granger's face, but twisted and pale. It was as Harry had seen
before in the hospital's back room, the image burned into his brain
during thirty long minutes of Transfiguration, the image he had
reproduced during four even longer hours to Transfigure the decoy.
The dead girl was naked, for her clothes were not part of her, and
had not been Transfigured.</p>
<p>The sight brought back flashbacks, of the hours spent in the
infirmary room, of the nightmares afterward, all of which Harry
suppressed.</p>
<p>"Go back," said Voldemort's high voice. "This is my work,
now."</p>
<p>Harry swallowed, and retreated from the altar, to the mouth of
the long corridor where he'd stood before. "Her body is, should be,
around five Celsius, I cooled her so, so there wouldn't be brain
damage -" Harry's own voice was wavering in pitch. <em>Is he really
going to do this? Really?</em> There had to be a catch and Harry
just couldn't see it. Voldemort had said that neither he nor any of
his would harm Hermione, that her body and mind would be her own -
<em>why?</em></p>
<p>Voldemort walked forth to the altar once more, orienting the
body before him with a wave of his hand to lie straight across the
altar. The Dark Lord spoke with high monotone precision, "Flesh,
flesh, flesh so wisely hidden."</p>
<p>The obelisks began chanting once more.</p>
<p><em>Apokatastethi, apokatastethi, apokatastethi to soma hou emoi
(emoi).</em></p>
<p><em>Apokatastethi, apokatastethi, apokatastethi to soma hou emoi
(emoi).</em></p>
<p>New flesh flowed out of the stumps of the girl's thighs,
creeping forward like an ooze and solidifying.</p>
<p>The obelisks ceased chanting. A complete form lay naked upon the
altar.</p>
<p>It didn't look like Hermione. A Hermione Granger should be
standing up and talking, she should have her Hogwarts uniform.</p>
<p>Voldemort raised a hand, then hissed, as though in annoyance.
With a violent gesture, the robes around Quirinus Quirrell's
sleeping from were torn in half, his purple-and-green tie shredded,
and his suit-jacket drawn from him to where Voldemort stood. Some
part of Harry flinched, as if seeing the Dark Lord Voldemort
attacking Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>Voldemort plunged his hand deliberately into the suit jacket,
which jerked as though something were being broken; then Voldemort
shook out the suit jacket onto the ground beside him, emptying out
the contents. Harry's pouch fell from it, and his Time-Turner, and
a broomstick, and Voldemort's gun, and the Cloak, and a number of
amulets and rings and stranger devices that Harry did not
recognize.</p>
<p>And finally a chunk of red glass, which was laid upon Hermione
Granger's form, and allowed to stay there for a time.</p>
<p>Minutes passed. The Dark Lord donned an amulet from the heap of
things beside the altar; also from the heap, Voldemort took four
short wooden rods with straps upon them, and reached beneath his
robes to attach them, it looked like they went on his upper arms
and upper thighs. The Dark Lord rose into the air, moved left,
right, up and down, seeming to wobble slightly at first; then his
flight stabilized.</p>
<p>The chunk of red glass turned, slightly.</p>
<p>The Dark Lord Voldemort floated to the ground, and prodded
Hermione Granger's body with his wand.</p>
<p>"<em>There iss an obsstacle,</em>" hissed Voldemort.</p>
<p>In Harry's mind the expectation of betrayal or other failure had
already been so strong that the confirmation came only as a dull
shock, not a sharp one. "<em>What obsstacle?</em> "</p>
<p>"<em>Girl'ss body iss resstored. Ssubstance iss repaired. But
not magic, or life... thiss iss body of dead Muggle."</em>
Voldemort turned from the altar, began to pace. "The full ritual
would solve this. But that would require time... time and the blood
of Granger's enemy, and I do not think Draco Malfoy still
qualifies, nor can I take my own blood unwillingly... foolish."
Voldemort's voice was a lower hiss. "Foolish, I should have
foreseen this, and prepared. Her brain might awaken with an
electrical shock, I know that much of Muggle medicine... but would
her magic return to her? That I do not know, and I suspect if she
awakens as a Muggle she will be a Muggle forever. Still, I can
think of nothing better." The Dark Lord raised his wand -</p>
<p>"Wait!" Harry blurted, feeling hope return. <em>She needs a
spark of life and magic, just a spark to get her
started...</em></p>
<p>Voldemort turned and looked at him. The snakelike face showed
some slight degree of surprise.</p>
<p>"<em>Think I have ssomething that might work,</em>" Harry
hissed. "<em>Needss wand. Have no intentionss to usse it againsst
you.</em>" Harry said nothing about expecting his intentions
wouldn't change; he'd simply blurted out the idea fast enough that
he hadn't formed any specific intentions yet.</p>
<p>"This," Voldemort hissed, "I desire to see." The Dark Lord
reached into the heap of things by the altar, and picked up the
wrapped form of Harry's wand. It was thrown, gliding through the
air and then dropping at Harry's feet; and then the Dark Lord
floated back, the heap of things moving smoothly backwards with
him.</p>
<p>Harry unwrapped his wand, and moved forward.</p>
<p><em>We have our wand back, that's step one,</em> said the last
voice, the voice of hope.</p>
<p>No part of Harry had any idea what step two might be, but it was
still step one accomplished.</p>
<p>And Harry stood before the reformed body of Hermione Granger,
who was still naked and dead, on a twilight-lit stone altar.</p>
<p>"Lord Voldemort," Harry said, "I beg you, please give her some
clothes. It might help me do this."</p>
<p>"Granted," hissed Voldemort. The pain in Harry's scar flared as
the naked girl's body lifted into the air, then flared again as
dead leaves danced around her and she was clothed in the seeming of
a Hogwarts uniform, though the trim was red instead of blue.
Hermione Granger's hands folded over her chest, her legs
straightened, and her body drifted back down.</p>
<p>Harry looked at her.</p>
<p>Focused on her, now that she looked human again.</p>
<p><em>She looks like she is sleeping, not dead.</em> It took a
conscious effort to look for breathing, fail to see it, and make
the deduction. So far as naked perception was concerned... Hermione
might as well be alive, right now.</p>
<p>That Hermione Granger would not approve of this situation, taken
as a whole, seemed beyond question. But it didn't mean that she
would rather stay dead than be alive, other things being equal,
though they might not be.</p>
<p><em>Because you wish to live, because my best guess is that you
would wish to live...</em></p>
<p>Harry reached out his shaking left hand, and touched Hermione's
forehead. It was warm now, not the chill of five degrees Celsius;
either Voldemort had increased her body temperature to normal, or
the magic of the ritual had done it automatically. Which meant that
Hermione's brain was currently warm and without oxygen, come to
think.</p>
<p>That did it, the sense of urgency rising in him.</p>
<p>Harry's feet assumed the stance, his wand swung up to point at
Hermione Granger's dead body. The <em>only</em> thing wrong with
Hermione's body was that it was dead; everything else about that
body was right, only one thing needed changing.</p>
<p><em>You don't belong here, death.</em></p>
<p><em>"Expecto,</em>" Harry shouted, feeling <em>the magic and the
life</em> rise up into the Patronus Charm that was fueled by both,
"<em>PATRONUM!</em> "</p>
<p>The girl in the Hogwarts uniform was surrounded by a blazing
aura of silver fire, as the Patronus was born inside her.</p>
<p>Harry staggered, as he felt a <em>dip,</em> a bite. Intuition or
Tom Riddle's memory told Harry that the life and magic that had
just flowed into Hermione would never return to him, either one. It
hadn't been all his life or all his magic, not by a long shot,
there hadn't been <em>time</em> to expend that much, but whatever
he'd just expended was gone forever.</p>
<p>And Hermione Granger was breathing, just like she was sleeping,
rhythmic inhalations and exhalations. The twilight sky had dimmed
further, and Harry could not see if color was returning to her, but
it should have been, it certainly should have been. She looked to
be sleeping peacefully, and it wasn't because being dead looked
like sleeping, it was because she was asleep and her body was fine
and nothing was hurting her while she slept.</p>
<p>Some part of Harry, that had somehow managed not to speak up
earlier, quietly pointed out that they were still in a graveyard,
the recently victorious Lord Voldemort was still in control of the
situation, and that his guess about Hermione wanting to be alive
was just a guess.</p>
<p>Harry was still smiling, as he slowly lowered his wand. The
celebratory fireworks going off inside his mind were restrained,
Harry wasn't screaming and running around in little circles like
Professor Flitwick, but that -</p>
<p>That -</p>
<p><em>THAT,</em> Harry said aloud inside his mind, <em>THAT is
what I call Step Two.</em></p>
<p>"Interesting," said the cold high voice. "Your Patronus draws
upon your life as well as your magic... I guessed that much, for it
was too powerful for a first-year to fuel with magic alone. And yet
there must be more to the puzzle, since not just any life-fueled
spell would have done... was your happy thought the image of her
returning to life? Was that all it took?" Lord Voldemort was again
toying with his wand, a dark interest in those red-slitted eyes. "I
suspect I will feel quite stupid when I finally comprehend that
spell, someday in my eternity. Now step away from the girl.
<em>There iss more work I intend to do, to give her besst chance of
continued life.</em>"</p>
<p>Harry stepped back, reluctantly, the sense of tension starting
to return to him. He almost tripped over one haphazard grave
marker, as the Dark Lord continued to walk forward.</p>
<p>Standing before the altar, the Dark Lord laid one finger upon
Hermione Granger's forehead.</p>
<p>Then the Dark Lord tapped his finger upon Hermione Granger's
forehead, and said, in a voice so low Harry almost did not hear,
"<em>Requiescus.</em>"</p>
<p>Voldemort waved his hand at an obelisk, which began to rotate,
turning itself to lay flat upon the ground, pointing outward.
"Fascinating indeed," Voldemort hissed. "She is alive, and magical,
and not another Tom Riddle as I feared you might have made
her."</p>
<p>The tension was rising again in Harry. He'd put his wand away
into the back belt of his pants, he <em>did not want</em> to remind
Voldemort that he still had the wand on him. "What are you doing to
her now?"</p>
<p>Another obelisk turned, lay flat upon the ground. "<em>There iss
old, losst ritual to ssacrifice magical creature, transsfer magical
nature to ssubject. Limitationss are great. Transsfer iss
temporary, only few hourss. Ssubject ssometimess diess when
transsfer wearss off. But Sstone will make permanent.</em>"</p>
<p>Four obelisks lay flat upon the ground, evenly spaced; the other
two obelisks had been floated away.</p>
<p>Voldemort began to reach into his own mouth, checked himself,
hissed with annoyance again. He gestured at the sleeping mouth of
Quirinus Quirrell, and from Quirrell's mouth floated up two teeth,
almost invisible in the falling night. One of these went to the
pile of items, the other floated to before the altar.</p>
<p>Moments later, Harry cried out and took a step back.</p>
<p>Huge and misshapen, lumpy skin, legs thick as tree-trunks, a
small head that looked like a coconut perched upon a boulder.</p>
<p>A mountain troll stood within the circle of obelisks, motionless
as though asleep while standing.</p>
<p>"<em>What are you doing?</em> "</p>
<p>Voldemort's mouth was stretched in a wide smile; it looked
<em>horrible</em> on him, like his face had too many teeth.
<em>"Sshall ssacrifice my fallback weapon, and girl-child sshall
gain troll'ss power of regeneration. Transsfiguration ssicknesss
iss nothing before that, if perchance it wass not fixed by
previouss ritual. And no knife sshall sslay girl-child, nor cutting
cursse, nor ssicknesss take her.</em>"</p>
<p>"Why - why are you doing this?" Harry's voice shook.</p>
<p>"<em>Have not the tiniesst intention of letting girl-child die
again, after going to ssuch lengthss to ressurrect her."</em></p>
<p>Harry swallowed. "I'm very confused." Was Voldemort
<em>practicing being nice?</em> This hypothesis did not seem like a
sufficient explanation.</p>
<p>"Stay well back," Voldemort said coldly. "This ritual is Darker
than the last." The Dark Lord began a new chant, softer syllables
that seemed to seethe through the air like living things; and
Harry, feeling a new surge of apprehension, stepped backwards.</p>
<p>Then Harry cried aloud, as pain flared again within his scar.
The mountain troll crumbled in on itself, becoming ashes hanging in
the air, then dust, and then the dust seemed to blow away without
going anywhere; it was gone.</p>
<p>Hermione Granger slept on peacefully, whatever spell of repose
Voldemort had cast on her being sufficient to the task.</p>
<p>"Um," Harry said in a small voice. "Did it work?"</p>
<p>"<em>Diffindo.</em>"</p>
<p>Harry stepped forward with a choked yell, and then halted, both
as the stupidity of his motion caught up with him, and as the
sudden cut that the Severing Charm had opened on Hermione's leg
closed almost as quickly as it had been made. In seconds there was
only a light stain of blood on the surrounding flesh.</p>
<p>The Stone was laid again on Hermione, and after a time it
turned. Voldemort laughed once more, as he passed his hand over
her. "Marvelous."</p>
<p>Then another tiny tooth was floating within the circle of
obelisks; and an instant later, a unicorn stood where the troll had
stood before, eyes dull and head lowered.</p>
<p>"What?" Harry said. "Why a <em>unicorn?</em> "</p>
<p>"<em>Power of unicorn'ss blood to presserve life makess
excellent combination with troll'ss healing. Only Fiendfyre and
Killing Cursse sshall girl-child fear, from thiss day."</em> A
flicker of snakish laughter. "<em>Bessidess, had sspare unicorn
left over, might ass well usse."</em></p>
<p>"Unicorn's blood has side effects-"</p>
<p>"<em>That iss only when power of unicorn'ss blood iss sstolen by
another. Thiss sspell will make power of unicorn belong insside
girl-child, ass if sshe wass alwayss born that way."</em></p>
<p>The grim chant and its seething words began again.</p>
<p>Harry watched, not understanding in the slightest.</p>
<p><em>Forget understanding, what am I seeing?</em></p>
<p><em>I'm seeing the Dark Lord Voldemort going to enormous lengths
to resurrect Hermione Granger and keep her alive. It's like he
thinks that his own life depends on Hermione Granger being alive,
somehow.</em></p>
<p>The confused parts of Harry looked around for a procedure to
follow. 'Make a prediction based on your best current hypothesis'
was the first thought that came to mind, but it didn't seem to lead
anywhere. The plot of the story wasn't going how it ought to, after
the villain had won.</p>
<p>Again the blaze of pain in his scar, like a blow to Harry's
forehead. The unicorn swayed, and then disintegrated as the troll
had done.</p>
<p>The Dark Lord laid the Stone upon Hermione's form once more,
clasping her hands around it.</p>
<p>Voldemort watched the unremarkable process for a time, then
turned while the Stone still laid on her, making a high humming
sound in his throat. "Ah, yes," hissed Voldemort. "That would be
most appropriate. Do you still have the diary I gave you, boy? The
diary of the famous scientist?"</p>
<p>Harry's brain took a moment to place what Voldemort was talking
about. It had been in Mary's Room, in Mary's Place, in October,
that precious gift from a friend. The thought should have triggered
a wave of awful sadness, for the Professor Quirrell that had been
lost or never real; but there had been enough of that emotion
already, and his brain had set it aside for now.</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said aloud. "I think it's in my pouch, can I
check?" Harry <em>knew</em> it was in the pouch. He'd loaded it up
with everything that he might possibly conceivably need, that he
owned or had bought; everything that could have been a quest
item.</p>
<p>From the heap of items by the altar, Harry's mokeskin pouch was
drawn out, tossed to Harry's feet.</p>
<p>"Roger Bacon's diary," Harry said as he reached in a hand, and
the diary appeared. Professor Quirrell had said that the diary
would emerge unscathed from a fire, so Harry threw it toward
Voldemort's altar. Harry did not wince; there were more important
things to worry about than polite treatment of books, even that
one.</p>
<p>Voldemort picked up the diary, examining it, appearing quite
absorbed.</p>
<p>Harry, as quietly and unobtrusively as he could, attached the
pouch to his belt loop in back, where it wouldn't be visible, near
where Harry had put his wand.</p>
<p><em>Step three, the pouch.</em></p>
<p>"Yes," Voldemort hissed as he flipped pages of the diary, "this
will do quite well."</p>
<p>"What was your hidden purpose behind the diary?" Harry said when
the pouch was attached to his belt, and he'd put both of his empty
hands where Voldemort could see them again. "I tried translating a
little at the beginning, but it was going slowly -" Actually, it
had been excruciatingly slow and Harry had found other
priorities.</p>
<p>"<em>Diary wass exactly what it sseemed, a gift meant to sseduce
you to my sside.</em>" Voldemort made intricate gestures in the air
with his wand, not even looking at what his hand was doing, as he
held the diary in his other hand. For a moment Harry thought he
could see a trail of darkness in the air, but the moonlight was too
faint for certainty. "And now, my dear boy," Voldemort's high voice
was laced with grim amusement, as his wand briefly tapped Hermione
Granger's forehead with a casual gesture, "I make this diary into a
far more precious gift, a sign of how much wisdom I have learned
from you. For I would never want you to be deprived of Hermione
Granger's counsel and restraint, not ever while the stars yet live.
<em>Avadakedavra.</em>"</p>
<p>The green bolt of the Killing Curse blazed out faster than Harry
could possibly have cast the Patronus Charm, faster than he could
possibly have moved, it was already over even as Harry cried out
and went for his wand.</p>
<p>Quirinus Quirrell's unconscious body did not even jerk, in
death. The green light struck into it without other sign.</p>
<p>Darkness glowed in the air, anti-light in the trails that
Voldemort had made before, and the Diary of Roger Bacon darkened as
though corruption were creeping over it, even as a shiver appeared
in the air around Hermione Granger's form.</p>
<p>The pain in Harry's scar flared overwhelmingly, like a brand
driven into his forehead, it sent Harry dodging unthinkingly to one
side as Tom Riddle's reflexes took over.</p>
<p>And Voldemort was also screaming, shrieking as he dropped the
diary to the ground, holding his own head and screaming.</p>
<p><em>Chance -</em></p>
<p>The last voice of hope said that, as Harry tried frantically to
think, to understand. There wasn't any <em>point</em> in trying to
kill Voldemort now, it might only <em>annoy</em> him, weapons
couldn't kill him while any of his hundreds of horcruxes remained
-</p>
<p>But it still seemed worth it to temporarily discarnate
Voldemort, take the Stone and Hermione and run.</p>
<p>Harry's right hand had already taken his wand. His left hand
went around to his back, reached awkwardly into his pouch, began to
make a silent sign, three English letters.</p>
<p>"No!" cried Voldemort. He'd dropped his hands from his head, was
staring at Hermione's body as though bewildered. "No, no!"</p>
<p>The item came up from Harry's pouch into his hand, and Harry
began to step forward as smoothly as he could, diminishing the
range between them to what his brief trials had shown was
doable.</p>
<p>"My great creation -" gasped Voldemort. His voice was high,
sounding panicked. "Two different spirits cannot exist in the same
world - it is gone, it is severed! A horcrux, I must make a horcrux
at once -" Voldemort's gaze fell on Hermione Granger's
still-sleeping form, and he began to raise his wand in the air,
executing the same gestures as before.</p>
<p>Harry raised his gun and pulled the trigger three times.</p>

Riddles<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>The Defense Professor had set up a cauldron, floating it into
place with a wave of his wand, another wave starting a fire beneath
it. A brief circling of the Defense Professor's finger had set in
motion a long-handled spoon, and it had continued stirring the
cauldron without being held. Now the Defense Professor was
measuring out a heap of flowers from a large jar, what Harry
supposed to be bellflowers; the indigo petals seemed luminous in
the white light of the walls, and curved inward in a way that gave
the impression of a desire for privacy. The first of these flowers
had been added to the potion at once, but then the cauldron had
just gone on stirring itself for a while.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor had assumed a position from which he could
see Harry just by turning his head slightly, and Harry knew that he
was within the Defense Professor's peripheral vision.</p>
<p>In the corner a Fiendfyre phoenix waited, some of the nearby
stone beginning to gloss over as it melted to greater smoothness.
The burning wings shed crimson light that gave everything in the
room a tint of blood, and reflected in scarlet sparks from the
glassware.</p>
<p>"Time is wasting," said Professor Quirrell. "Ask your questions,
if you have them."</p>
<p><em>Why, Professor Quirrell, why, why must you be this way, why
make yourself the monster, why Lord Voldemort, I know you might not
want the same things I do, but I can't imagine what you want that
makes</em> this <em>the best way to get it...</em></p>
<p>That was what Harry's brain wanted to know.</p>
<p>What Harry <em>needed</em> to know was... some way out of what
was going to happen next. But the Defense Professor had said that
he wouldn't talk about his future plans. It was strange enough that
the Defense Professor was willing to talk about <em>anything,</em>
that had to contradict one of his Rules...</p>
<p>"I'm thinking," Harry said aloud.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell smiled slightly. He was using a pestle to
grind the potion's first magical ingredient, a glowing red hexagon.
"I <em>quite</em> understand," said the Defense Professor. "But do
not think over-long, child."</p>
<p><em>Goals: Prevent Lord Voldemort from harming people, find a
way to kill or neutralise him, but first get the Stone and
resurrect Hermione...</em></p>
<p><em>...convince Professor Quirrell to STOP THIS...</em></p>
<p>Harry swallowed, pushing down the emotion, trying not to let the
water reach his eyes. Tears probably wouldn't make a good
impression on Lord Voldemort. Professor Quirrell was already
frowning, though from the direction of his gaze he was examining a
leaf colored in vivid shades of white, green, and purple.</p>
<p>There wasn't any obvious way to reach any of the goals, not yet.
All Harry could do was ask the questions that seemed most likely to
provide useful information, even if Harry didn't yet have a
plan.</p>
<p><em>So we just ask about whatever seems most interesting?</em>
said Harry's Ravenclaw side. <em>I'm up for that.</em></p>
<p><em>Shut up,</em> Harry told the voice; and then, on further
reflection, decided that he was no longer pretending it was
there.</p>
<p>Four topics came to Harry's mind as being priorities from the
standpoint of curiosity about important things. Four questions,
then, four major subjects, to try to fit in while this potion was
still being brewed.</p>
<p>Four questions...</p>
<p>"I ask my first question," Harry said. "What really happened on
the night of October 31st, 1981?" <em>Why was that night different
from all other nights...</em> "I would like the entire story,
please."</p>
<p>The question of how and why Lord Voldemort had survived his
apparent death seemed likely to matter for future planning.</p>
<p>"I expected you would ask that," Professor Quirrell said,
dropping a bellflower and a white glittering stone into the potion.
"To begin, everything I told you about the horcrux spell is true;
as you should realise, since I spoke in Parseltongue."</p>
<p>Harry nodded.</p>
<p>"Within seconds after you learned the details of the spell, you
perceived the central flaw, and began pondering how the spell might
be improved. Do you think the young Tom Riddle was any
different?"</p>
<p>Harry shook his head.</p>
<p>"Well, he was," said Professor Quirrell. "Whenever I was tempted
to despair of you, I reminded myself how I was an idiot at twice
your age. When I was fifteen I made myself a horcrux as a certain
book had shown me, using the death of Abigail Myrtle beneath the
eyes of Slytherin's basilisk. I planned to make a new horcrux every
year after I left Hogwarts, and call that my fallback plan if my
other hopes of immortality did not come to fruition. In retrospect,
the young Tom Riddle was grasping straws. The thought of making a
<em>better</em> horcrux, of not being content with the spell I had
already learned... this thought did not come to me until I had
grasped the stupidity of ordinary people, and realised which
follies of theirs I had imitated. But in time I learned the habit
that you inherited from me, to ask in every instance how it might
be done better. To be content with the spell I had learned from a
book, when it bore only a faint resemblance to what I truly wanted?
Absurd! And so I set forth to create a better spell."</p>
<p>"You have true immortality, now?" Harry was aware that, even
with everything else going on, this was a question more important
than war and strategy.</p>
<p>"Indeed," said Professor Quirrell. He paused in his Potions work
and turned to face Harry fully; there was a look of exultation in
the man's eyes that Harry had never seen there before. "In all the
Darkest Arts I could find, in all the interdicted secrets to which
Slytherin's Monster gave me keys, in all the lore remembered among
wizardkind, I found only hints and smatterings of what I needed. So
I rewove it and remade it, and devised a new ritual based on new
principles. I kept that ritual burning in my mind for years,
perfecting it in imagination, pondering its meaning and making fine
adjustments, waiting for the intention to stabilise. At last I
dared to invoke my ritual, an invented sacrificial ritual, based on
a principle untested by all known magic. And I lived, and yet
live." The Defense Professor spoke with quiet triumph, as though
the act itself was so great that no words could ever do it justice.
"I still use the word 'horcrux', but only from sentiment. It is a
new thing entirely, the greatest of all my creations."</p>
<p>"As one of my questions you said you'd answer, I ask how to cast
that spell," Harry said.</p>
<p>"Denied." The Defense Professor turned back to his potion,
dropping in a gray-flecked white feather and a bellflower. "I had
thought perhaps to teach you when you were older, for no Tom Riddle
would be content otherwise; but I have changed my mind."</p>
<p>Memory is a hard thing to recall, sometimes, and Harry had been
trying to remember if Professor Quirrell had dropped any hints
about this subject before. Something about Professor Quirrell's
phrasing sparked a memory: <em>Perhaps you will be told when you
are older...</em></p>
<p>"There are still physical anchors for your immortality," Harry
said aloud. "It resembles the old horcrux spell by that much, which
is another reason you still call them horcruxes." It was dangerous
to say aloud, but Harry needed to <em>know.</em> "If I'm wrong, you
can always deny it in Parseltongue."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was smiling evilly. "<em>Your guesss iss
right, boy, for all the good it doess you.</em>"</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that wasn't a difficult vulnerability to cover if
the Enemy was smart. Harry wouldn't ordinarily have made the
suggestion, just in case the Enemy <em>hadn't</em> thought of it
for themselves, but in this case he'd already made it. "One horcux
dropped into an active volcano, weighted so it would sink into the
Earth's mantle," Harry said heavily. "The same place I thought of
dropping the Dementor if I couldn't destroy it. And then you asked
me where else I would hide something if I didn't want anyone to
find it ever again. One horcrux buried kilometers down, in an
anonymous cubic meter of the Earth's crust. One horcrux you dropped
into the Mariana Trench. One horcrux floating high in the
stratosphere, transparent. Even you don't know where they are,
because you Obliviated the exact details from your memory. And the
last horcrux is the Pioneer 11 plaque that you snuck into NASA and
modified. It's where you get your image of the stars, when you cast
the spell of starlight. Fire, earth, water, air, void."
<em>Something of a riddle,</em> the Defense Professor had called
it, and therefore Harry had remembered it. Something of a
Riddle.</p>
<p>"Indeed," said the Defense Professor. "It did give me something
of a shock when you remembered it that quickly, but I suppose it
makes no difference; all five are beyond my reach, or yours."</p>
<p>That might not be true, especially if there was some way to
trace the magical connection somehow and determine the location...
though presumably Voldemort would have done his best to obscure
it... but what magic had done, magic might be able to defeat.
Pioneer 11 might be far away by wizard standards, but NASA knew
exactly where it was, and it was probably a lot more reachable if
you could use magic to tell the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation to
bugger off...</p>
<p>A sudden note of worry plucked at Harry's mind. There was no
rule saying the Defense Professor needed to have told the truth
about <em>which</em> interstellar probe he'd horcruxed, and if
Harry recalled correctly, communication and tracking of the Pioneer
10 probe had been lost shortly after the Jupiter fly-by.</p>
<p>Why wouldn't Professor Quirrell have just horcruxed them
both?</p>
<p>The obvious next thought came to Harry. It was something that
ought not to be suggested, if the Enemy had not thought of it. But
it seemed extremely probable that the Enemy had thought of it.</p>
<p>"<em>Tell me, teacher,</em>" Harry hissed, "<em>would
desstroying thosse five anchors sslay you?</em> "</p>
<p>"<em>Why do you assk?</em> " hissed the Defense Professor, with
a lilt to the hiss that Parseltongue translated as snakish
amusement. "<em>Do you ssusspect that ansswer is no?</em> "</p>
<p>Harry couldn't think of how to answer, though he strongly
suspected that it didn't matter in any case.</p>
<p><em>"Your ssusspicion iss right, boy. Desstroying thosse five
would not render me mortal.</em>"</p>
<p>Harry's throat felt a bit dry again. If the spell had no
disastrous cost associated with it... "<em>How many anchorss did
you make?</em> "</p>
<p>"<em>Would not ordinarily ssay, but iss clear you have already
guesssed."</em> The Defense Professor's smile widened. <em>"Ansswer
iss that I do not know. Sstopped counting ssomewhere around one
hundred and sseven. Ssimply made a habit of it each time I murdered
ssomeone in private.</em>"</p>
<p>Over <em>one hundred</em> murders, in private, before Lord
Voldemort had stopped counting. And even worse news - "Your
immortality spell still requires a human death? <em>Why?</em> "</p>
<p><em>"Great creation maintainss life and magic within devicess
created by ssacrificing life and magic of otherss.</em>" Again that
hissing snake laughter. "<em>Liked falsse desscription of
previousss horcrux sspell sso much, sso dissappointed when
realissed truth of it, thoughtss of improved verssion came out in
that sshape."</em></p>
<p>Harry wasn't sure why the Defense Professor was giving him all
this vital information, <em>but there had to be a reason,</em> and
that was making him nervous. "So you really are a disembodied
spirit possessing Quirinus Quirrell."</p>
<p>"<em>Yess. I sshall return sswiftly, if thiss body iss killed.
Will be greatly annoyed, and vengeful.</em> I am telling you this,
boy, so that you do not try anything stupid."</p>
<p>"I understand," Harry said. He did his best to organize his
thoughts, remember what he'd meant to ask next, while the Defense
Professor turned his eyes back to the potion. The man's left hand
was dribbling crushed seashell into the cauldron, while his right
hand dropped in another bellflower. "So what did happen on October
31st? You... tried to turn the baby Harry Potter into a horcrux,
either the new kind or the old kind. You did it deliberately,
because you told Lily Potter," Harry took a breath. Now that he
knew <em>why</em> the chills were there, he could endure them.
"Very well, I accept the bargain. Yourself to die, and the child to
live. Now drop your wand so that I can murder you." In retrospect,
it was clear that Harry had remembered that event mainly from Lord
Voldemort's perspective, and only at the very end had he seen it
through the baby Harry Potter's eyes. "What did you do?
<em>Why</em> did you do it?"</p>
<p>"Trelawney's prophecy," Professor Quirrell said. His hand tapped
a bellflower with a strip of copper before dropping it in. "I spent
long days pondering it, after Snape brought the prophecy to me.
Prophecies are never trivial things. And how shall I put this in a
way that does not make you think stupid things... well, I shall say
it, and if you are stupid I shall be annoyed. I was fascinated by
the prophecy's assertion that someone would be my equal, because it
might mean that person could hold up the other end of an
intelligent conversation. After fifty years of being surrounded by
gibbering stupidity, I no longer cared whether my reaction might be
considered a literary cliche. I was not about to pass up on that
opportunity without thinking about it first. And then, you see, I
had a <em>clever idea</em>." Professor Quirrell sighed. "It
occurred to me how I might fulfill the Prophecy my own way, to my
own benefit. I would mark the baby as my equal by casting the old
horcrux spell in such fashion as to imprint my own spirit onto the
baby's blank slate; it would be a purer copy of myself, since there
would be no old self to mix with the new. In some years, when I had
become bored with ruling Britain and moved on to other things, I
would arrange with the other Tom Riddle that he should appear to
vanquish me, and he would rule over the Britain he had saved. We
would play the game against each other forever, keeping our lives
interesting amid a world of fools. I knew a dramatist would predict
that the two of us would end by destroying each other; but I
pondered long upon it, and decided that both of us would simply
decline to play out the drama. That was my decision and I was
confident that it would remain so; both Tom Riddles, I thought,
would be too intelligent to truly go down that road. The prophecy
seemed to hint that if I destroyed all but a remnant of Harry
Potter, then our spirits would not be so different, and we could
exist in the same world."</p>
<p>"Something went wrong," Harry said. "Something that blew off the
top of the Potters' home in Godric's Hollow, gave me the scar on my
forehead, and left your burnt body behind."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell nodded. His hands had slowed in their Potions
work. "The resonance in our magic," Professor Quirrell said
quietly. "When I had shaped the baby's spirit to be like my
own..."</p>
<p>Harry remembered the moment in Azkaban when Professor Quirrell's
Killing Curse had collided with his Patronus. The burning, tearing
agony in his forehead, like his head had been about to split in
half.</p>
<p>"I cannot count how many times I have thought of that night,
rehearsing my mistake, thinking of wiser things I should have
done," said Professor Quirrell. "I later decided that I should have
thrown my wand from my hand and changed into my Animagus form. But
that night... that night, I instinctively tried to control the
chaotic fluctuations in my magic, even as I felt myself burning up
from inside. That was the wrong decision, and I failed. So my body
was destroyed, even as I overwrote the infant Harry Potter's mind;
<em>either</em> of us destroying all but a remnant of the other.
And then..." Professor Quirrell's expression was controlled. "And
then, when I regained consciousness inside my horcruxes, it turned
out that my great creation did not work as I had hoped. I should
have been able to float free of my horcruxes and possess any victim
that consented to me, or that was too weak to refuse me.
<em>That</em> was the part of my great creation that failed my
intent. As with the original horcrux spell, I would only be able to
enter a victim who contacted the physical horcrux... and I had
hidden my unnumbered horcruxes in places where nobody would ever
find them. Your instinct is correct, boy, <em>this would not be a
good time to laugh.</em>"</p>
<p>Harry stayed very quiet.</p>
<p>The Potions-making had come to a temporary pause, a space where
no ingredients were added while the cauldron simmered for a time.
"I spent most of my time looking at the stars," Professor Quirrell
said, his voice quieter now. The Defense Professor had turned from
the potion, staring at the white-illuminated walls of the room. "My
remaining hope was the horcruxes I had hidden in the hopeless
idiocy of my youth. Imbuing them into ancient lockets, instead of
anonymous pebbles; guarding them beneath wells of poison in the
center of a lake of Inferi, instead of portkeying them into the
sea. If someone found one of those, and penetrated their ridiculous
protections... but that seemed like a distant hope. I was not sure
I would ever be embodied again. Yet at least I was immortal. The
worst of all fates had been averted, my great creation had done
that much. I had little left to hope for, and little left to fear.
I decided that I would not go insane, since there seemed to be no
advantage in it. Instead, I gazed out at the stars and thought, as
the Sun slowly diminished behind me. I reflected on the errors of
my past life; they were many, in that hindsight. In my imagination
I constructed powerful new rituals I might attempt, if I was free
to use my magic once more, and yet confident of my immortality. I
contemplated ancient riddles at greater length than before, for all
that I had once thought myself patient. I knew that if I won free,
I would be more powerful by far than in my previous life; but I
mostly did not expect that to happen." Professor Quirrell turned
back to the potion. "Nine years and four months after that night, a
wandering adventurer named Quirinus Quirrell won past the
protections guarding one of my earliest horcruxes. The rest you
know. And now, boy, you may say what we both know you are
thinking."</p>
<p>"Um," Harry said. "It doesn't seem like a very smart thing to
say -"</p>
<p>"Indeed, Mr. Potter. It is not a clever thing to say to me. Not
even a little. Not in the slightest. But I <em>know you're thinking
it,</em> and you will <em>go on thinking it</em> and I will <em>go
on knowing that</em> until you say it. So speak."</p>
<p>"So. Um. I realise that this is something that is more obvious
in hindsight than in foresight, and I'm certainly not suggesting
that you try to correct the error now, but if you are a Dark Lord
and you happen to hear about a child who has been prophesied to
defeat you, there is a certain spell which is unblockable,
unstoppable, and works every single time on anything with a brain
-"</p>
<p>"<em>Yes thank you Mr. Potter that thought occurred to me
several times over the next nine years.</em>" Professor Quirrell
picked up another bellflower and began crumbling it in his bare
fist. "I made that principle the centerpiece of my Battle Magic
curriculum after I learned its centrality the hard way. It was
<em>not</em> the first Rule on the younger Tom Riddle's list. It is
only by harsh experience that we learn which principles take
priority over which other principles; as mere words they all sound
equally persuasive. In retrospect it would have been better if I
had sent Bellatrix to the Potters' home in my place; but I had a
Rule telling me that for such matters I must go myself and not try
sending a trusted lieutenant. <em>Yes,</em> I considered the
Killing Curse; but I wondered if casting the Killing Curse at an
infant would somehow cause the curse to bounce off and hit me, thus
fulfilling the prophecy. How was I to know?"</p>
<p>"So use an axe, it's hard to get a prophecy-fulfilling spell
backfire out of an axe," Harry said and then shut up.</p>
<p>"I decided the safest path was to try to fulfill the prophecy on
my own terms," Professor Quirrell said. "Needless to say, the next
time I hear a prophecy I do not like, I will tear it apart at
<em>every possible point of intervention</em>, rather than trying
to play along." Professor Quirrell was crushing a rose as though to
squeeze the juice out of it, still using his bare fist. "And now
everyone thinks the Boy-Who-Lived is somehow immune to the Killing
Curse, even though Killing Curses do not ruin houses or leave burnt
bodies behind them, <em>because it has not occurred to them that
Lord Voldemort would ever use any other spell.</em>"</p>
<p>Harry again stayed quiet. It had occurred to Harry that there
was another obvious way that Lord Voldemort could have avoided his
mistake. Something that might perhaps be easier to see given a
Muggle upbringing, instead of the wizarding way of looking at
things.</p>
<p>Harry had not yet decided whether to tell Professor Quirrell
about his thought; there were both pros and cons to pointing out
that particular error.</p>
<p>After a time Professor Quirrell picked up the next Potions
ingredient, a strand of what looked like unicorn hair. "I tell you
this as a caution," said Professor Quirrell. "Do not expect me to
be delayed another nine years, if you somehow destroy this body of
mine. I set horcruxes in better places at once, and now even that
is unnecessary. Thanks to you, I learned where to find the
Resurrection Stone. The Resurrection Stone does not bring back the
dead, of course; but it holds a more ancient magic than my own for
projecting the seeming of a spirit. And since I am one who has
defeated death, Cadmus's Hallow acknowledged me its master, and
answered all my will. I have now incorporated it into my great
creation." Professor Quirrell smiled slightly. "I had many years
earlier considered making that device a horcrux, but decided
against it at the time, since I realized that the ring had magic of
unknown nature... ah, such ironies does life play upon us. But I
digress. <em>You</em>, boy, you brought that about, you freed my
spirit to fly where it pleases and seduce the most opportune
victim, by being too casual with your secrets. It is a catastrophe
for any who oppose me, and you wrought it with one finger drawing
wetness on a tea-saucer. This world will be a safer place for all,
if you learn the rectitude that wizardborns absorb in childhood.
<em>And all thiss that I have jusst said iss the truth.</em>"</p>
<p>Harry closed his eyes, and his own hand massaged his forehead;
if he had seen it from the outside, it would have looked the mirror
of Professor Quirrell in deep thought.</p>
<p>The problem of defeating Professor Quirrell was looking
increasingly difficult, even by the standards of the sort of
impossible problems that Harry had solved already. If communicating
that difficulty was what Professor Quirrell was trying to do, he
was <em>succeeding.</em> Harry was starting to seriously consider
the possibility that it might be better to offer to rule Britain as
Voldemort's <em>nonhomicidal</em> delegate, if Professor Quirrell
himself would just agree to <em>stop killing people all the
time.</em> Even <em>mostly</em>.</p>
<p>But that wasn't likely to happen.</p>
<p>Harry stared at his hands, from where he had sat down upon the
floor, feeling sadness shading over into despair. The Lord
Voldemort who'd given Harry his dark side had spent <em>that
long</em> thinking things over and reflecting on his own thought
processes... and had emerged as the calm, clear-headed, and still
homicidal Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell added a pinch of golden hair to the
<em>potion of effulgence,</em> and that reminded Harry that time
was continuing to move; the locks of bright hair were rarer than
the bellflowers.</p>
<p>"I ask my second question," Harry said. "Tell me about the
Philosopher's Stone. Does it do anything besides making
Transfigurations permanent? Is it possible to make more Stones, and
why is that problem hard?"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was bent over the potion, and Harry could not
see his face. "Very well, I shall tell you the Stone's story as I
have inferred it. The one and only power of the Stone is the
imposition of permanency, to render a temporary form into a true
and lasting substance - a power absolutely beyond ordinary spells.
Conjurations such as the castle Hogwarts are maintained by a
constant well of magic. Even Metamorphmagi cannot manifest golden
fingernails and then trim them for sale. It is theorized that the
Metamorphmagus curse merely rearranges the substance of their
flesh, like a Muggle smith manipulates iron with hammer and tongs;
and their body contains no gold. If Merlin himself could create
gold from thin air, history does not record it. So the Stone, we
can guess even before research, must be a very old thing indeed. In
contrast, Nicholas Flamel has been known to the world for a mere
six centuries. Tell me the obvious next question to ask, boy, if
you wanted to trace the Stone's history."</p>
<p>"Um," Harry said. He rubbed his forehead, concentrating. If the
Stone was old, but the world had only known Nicholas Flamel for six
centuries... "Was there some other very long-lived wizard who
disappeared at around the same time Nicholas Flamel showed up?"</p>
<p>"Close," said Professor Quirrell. "You recall that six centuries
ago there was a Dark Lady called undying, the sorceress Baba Yaga?
She was said to be able to heal any wound in herself, to change
shape into any form she pleased... she held the Stone of
Permanency, obviously. And then one year Baba Yaga agreed to teach
Battle Magic at Hogwarts, under an old and respected truce."
Professor Quirrell looked... <em>angry,</em> a look such as Harry
had rarely seen on him. "But she was not trusted, and so there was
invoked a curse. Some curses are easier to cast when they bind
yourself and others alike; Slytherin's Parselmouth curse is an
example of such. In this case, Baba Yaga's signature, and
signatures from every student and teacher of Hogwarts, were placed
within an ancient device known as the Goblet of Fire. Baba Yaga
swore not to shed a drop of students' blood, nor take from the
students anything that was theirs. In return, the students swore
not to shed a drop of Baba Yaga's blood, nor take from her anything
that was hers. So they all signed, with the Goblet of Fire to
witness it and punish the transgressor."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell picked up a new ingredient, a loose thread of
gold wrapped around a pinch of foul-looking substance. "Entering
her sixth year at Hogwarts, then, was a witch named Perenelle. And
although Perenelle was new-come into the beauty of her youth, her
heart was already blacker than Baba Yaga's own -"</p>
<p>"<em>You're</em> calling her evil?" Harry said, then realized he
had just committed the fallacy of <em>ad hominem tu
quoque.</em></p>
<p>"Hush, boy, I am telling the story. Where was I? Ah, yes,
Perenelle, the beautiful and covetous. Perenelle seduced the Dark
Lady over the months, with gentle touches and flirtations and the
shy pretense of innocence. The Dark Lady's heart was captured, and
they became lovers. And then one night Perenelle whispered how she
had heard of Baba Yaga's shape-changing power and how this thought
had enflamed her desires; thus Perenelle swayed Baba Yaga to come
to her with the Stone in hand, to assume many guises in a single
night, for their pleasures. Among other forms Perenelle bid Baba
Yaga take the form of a man; and they lay together in the fashion
of a man and a woman. But Perenelle had been a virgin until that
night. And since they were all rather old-fashioned in those days,
the Goblet of Fire accounted that as the shedding of Perenelle's
blood, and the taking of what was hers; thus Baba Yaga was tricked
into being forsworn. Then Perenelle killed the unsuspecting Baba
Yaga as she slept in Perenelle's bed, killed the Dark Lady who had
loved her and come peacefully to Hogwarts under truce; and that was
the end of the pact by which Dark Wizards and Witches taught Battle
Magic at Hogwarts. For the next few centuries the Goblet of Fire
was used to oversee pointless inter-school tournaments, and then it
resided in a disused chamber at Beauxbatons, until I finally stole
it." Professor Quirrell dropped a pale beige-pink twig into the
cauldron, and its color changed to white just as it touched the
surface. "But I digress. Perenelle took the Stone from Baba Yaga,
and assumed the guise and name of Nicholas Flamel. She also kept
her identity as Perenelle, calling herself Flamel's wife. The two
have appeared together in public, but that might be done by any
number of obvious methods."</p>
<p>"And the Stone's manufacture?" said Harry, his brain working to
process all this. "I saw an alchemical recipe for it, in a book
-"</p>
<p>"Another lie. Perenelle was making it appear as though 'Nicholas
Flamel' had earned the right to live forever by completing a great
magic that any could attempt. And she was giving others a false
path to pursue, instead of seeking the one true Stone as Perenelle
had sought Baba Yaga's." Professor Quirrell looked rather sour. "It
should come as no surprise that I spent years trying to master that
false recipe. Next you will ask why I did not kidnap, torture, and
kill Perenelle after I learned the truth."</p>
<p>This had not in fact been a question that had come into Harry's
mind.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell continued to speak. "The answer is that
Perenelle had foreseen and forestalled the ambitions of Dark
Wizards like myself. 'Nicholas Flamel' publicly took Unbreakable
Vows not to be coerced by any means into relinquishing his Stone -
to guard immortality from the covetous, he claimed, as if that were
a public service. I was afraid the Stone would be lost forever, if
Perenelle died without saying where it was hidden, and her Vow
prevented attempts at torture. Further, I had hopes of gaining
Perenelle's knowledge, if I could find the right strategy to
extract it from her. Though Perenelle began with little lore of her
own, she has held hostage the lives of wizards greater than
herself, holding out dribs and drabs of healing in exchange for
secrets, and small reversals of age in exchange for power.
Perenelle does not condescend to bestow any real youth upon others
- but if you hear of a wizard who lived, greybearded, to the age of
two hundred and fifty, you may be sure that her hand was in play.
By my own generation, the centuries had given Perenelle enough of
an advantage that she could raise up Albus Dumbledore as a
counterweight to the Dark Lord Grindelwald. When I appeared as Lord
Voldemort, Perenelle raised up Dumbledore yet further, parceling
out another drop of her hoarded lore whenever Lord Voldemort seemed
to gain an advantage. I felt like I ought to be able to figure out
something clever to do with that situation, but I never did. I did
not attack her directly, for I was not sure of my great creation;
it was not impossible that I would someday need to go begging to
her for a dollop of reversed age." Professor Quirrell dropped two
bellflowers at once into the potion, and they seemed to merge as
they touched the bubbling liquid. "But now I am sure of my
creation, and so I have decided that the time has come to take the
Stone by force."</p>
<p>Harry hesitated. "I would like to hear you answer in
Parseltongue, was all of that true?"</p>
<p>"<em>None of it iss known to me to be falsse,</em>" said
Professor Quirrell. "Telling a tale implies filling in certain
gaps; I was not present to observe when Perenelle seduced Baba
Yaga. <em>The bassicss sshould be mosstly correct, I
think.</em>"</p>
<p>Harry had noticed a trace of confusion<em>.</em> "Then I don't
understand why the Stone is here in Hogwarts. Wouldn't the best
defense just be hiding it under an anonymous rock in
Greenland?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps she respected my abilities as a particularly good
finder," said the Defense Professor. He appeared focused on his
cauldron as he dipped a bellflower into a jar of liquid labeled
with the Potions symbol for rainwater.</p>
<p><em>We are very much alike, the Defense Professor and I, in some
ways if not others. If I imagine what I'd do, given his
problem...</em></p>
<p>"Did you bluff everyone into <em>believing</em> you had some way
of finding the Stone?" Harry said aloud. "So that Perenelle would
put it inside Hogwarts, where Dumbledore could guard it?"</p>
<p>The Defense Professor sighed, not looking up from the cauldron.
"I suppose that strategem would be futile to conceal from you. Yes,
after I possessed Quirrell and returned, I implemented a strategy I
had conceived while gazing at the stars. First I made sure to be
accepted as Defense Professor at Hogwarts, for it would not do to
have suspicions raised while I was still seeking employment. When
that was done, I arranged for one of Perenelle's curse-breaking
expeditions to discover a falsified but credible inscription
describing how the Crown of the Serpent could be used to seek out
the Stone wherever it was hidden. Immediately after, before
Perenelle could buy up the Crown, it was stolen; furthermore I left
clear indications that the thief had possessed the power to speak
to snakes. So Perenelle thought that I could infallibly find the
Stone's location, and that it needed a guardian powerful enough to
defeat me. That is how the Stone came to be held in Hogwarts, in
Dumbledore's domain. Just as I intended, naturally, since I had
already gained access to Hogwarts for the year. I think that is all
of this that concerns you, if I speak not of future plans."</p>
<p>Harry frowned. Professor Quirrell should not have told him that.
Unless the strategy had somehow become irrelevant to any future
deception of Perenelle...? Or unless, by answering so quickly, the
Defense Professor had hoped to have people conclude that it was a
double-bluff, and that the Crown of the Serpent really could find
the Stone...</p>
<p>Harry decided not to question this answer in Parseltongue.</p>
<p>Another lock of bright hair, seeming white but not with age, was
gently dribbled into the cauldron, again reminding Harry that they
were on a time limit. Harry considered, but he couldn't see any
further path to pursue this line of questioning; there was no known
way to manufacture more Philosopher's Stones and no obvious way to
invent such, which was probably the <em>objectively</em> worst news
Harry had heard all day.</p>
<p>Harry took a deep breath. "I ask my third question," Harry said.
"What's the truth behind this entire school year? All the plots you
ran, all the plots you know about."</p>
<p>"Hm," said Professor Quirrell, dropping another bellflower into
the potion, accompanied by a plant-shape like a tiny cross. "Let me
see... the most shocking twist is that the Defense Professor turns
out to be secretly Voldemort."</p>
<p>"Well, obviously," Harry said, with a good deal of self-directed
bitterness.</p>
<p>"Then where do you wish me to start?"</p>
<p>"Why did you kill Hermione?" The question just slipped out.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's pale eyes glanced up from the potion,
watched him intently. "One would think that should be evident - but
I suppose I cannot blame you for distrusting what seems evident. To
understand the object of an obscure plot, observe its consequences
and ask who might have intended them. I killed Miss Granger to
improve your position relative to that of Lucius Malfoy, since my
plans did not call for him to have so much leverage over you. I
admit I am impressed by how far you managed to parlay that
opening."</p>
<p>Harry unclenched his teeth, which took an effort. "That's after
your failed attempt to <em>frame</em> Hermione for the attempted
murder of Draco and <em>send her to Azkaban</em> because of
<em>why?</em> Because you didn't like the influence she was having
on me?"</p>
<p>"Don't be ridiculous," Professor Quirrell said. "If I had only
wished to remove Miss Granger, I would not have brought the Malfoys
into it. I observed your game with Draco Malfoy and found it
amusing, but I knew it could not continue for very long before
Lucius learned and intervened; and then your folly would have
brought you great trouble, for Lucius would not take it lightly.
Had you just been able to <em>lose</em> during the Wizengamot
trial, <em>lose</em> as I had taught you, then in only two more
weeks, ironclad evidence would have shown that Lucius Malfoy, after
discovering his son's seeming perfidy, had Imperiused Professor
Sprout into using the Blood-Cooling Charm on Mr. Malfoy and casting
the False Memory Charm on Miss Granger. Lucius would have been
swept off the political gameboard, sent to exile if not Azkaban;
Draco Malfoy would have inherited the wealth of House Malfoy, and
your influence over him would have been unchallenged. Instead I had
to abort that plot in mid-course. You managed to completely disrupt
the real plan in the course of sacrificing double your entire
fortune, by giving Lucius Malfoy the perfect opportunity to prove
his true concern for his son. You have an incredible anti-talent
for meddling, I must say."</p>
<p>"And you also thought," Harry said, even with his dark side's
patterns he had to work to keep his voice level and cool, "that two
weeks in Azkaban would improve Miss Granger's disposition, and get
her to stop being a bad influence on me. So you somehow arranged
for there to be newspaper stories calling for her to be sent to
Azkaban, rather than some other penalty."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's lips drew up in a thin smile. "Good catch,
boy. Yes, I thought she might serve as your Bellatrix. That
particular outcome would also have provided you with a constant
reminder of how much respect was due the law, and helped you
develop appropriate attitudes toward the Ministry."</p>
<p>"Your plot was stupidly complicated and had no chance of
working." Harry knew he ought to be more tactful, that he was
engaging in more of what Professor Quirrell called <em>folly,</em>
but in that instant he could not bring himself to care.</p>
<p>"It was less complicated than Dumbledore's plot to have the
three armies tie in the Christmas Battle, and not much more
complicated than my own plot to make you think Dumbledore had
blackmailed Mr. Zabini. The insight you are missing, Mr. Potter, is
that these were not plots that <em>needed</em> to succeed."
Professor Quirrell continued to casually stir the potion, smiling.
"There are plots that <em>must</em> succeed, where you keep the
core idea as simple as possible and take every precaution. There
are also plots where it is acceptable to fail, and with those you
can indulge yourself, or test the limits of your ability to handle
complications. It was not as if something going wrong with any of
those plots would have killed me." Professor Quirrell was no longer
smiling. "Our journey into Azkaban was of the first type, and I was
less amused by your antics there."</p>
<p>"What <em>exactly</em> did you do to Hermione?" Some part of
Harry wondered at the evenness of his voice.</p>
<p>"Obliviations and False Memory Charms. I could not trust
anything else to go undetected by the Hogwarts wards and the
scrutiny I knew her mind would undergo." A flicker of frustration
crossed Professor Quirrell's face. "Part of what you rightly call
complication is because the first version of my plot did not go as
planned, and I had to modify it. I came to Miss Granger in the
hallways wearing the appearance of Professor Sprout, to offer her a
conspiracy. My first attempt at suasion failed. I Obliviated her
and tried again with a new presentation. The second bait failed.
The third bait failed. The <em>tenth</em> bait failed. I was so
frustrated that I began going through my entire library of guises,
including those more appropriate to Mr. Zabini. <em>Still</em>
nothing worked. The child <em>would not</em> violate her childish
code."</p>
<p>"<em>You</em> do not get to call her childish, Professor."
Harry's voice sounded strange in his own ears. "Her code
<em>worked.</em> It prevented you from tricking her. The whole
point of having deontological ethical injunctions is that arguments
for violating them are often much less trustworthy than they look.
You don't get to criticize her rules when they worked exactly as
intended." After they resurrected Hermione, Harry would tell her
that Lord Voldemort himself hadn't been able to tempt her into
doing wrong, and that was why he'd killed her.</p>
<p>"Fair enough, I suppose," said Professor Quirrell. "There is a
saying that even a stopped clock is right twice a day, and I do not
think Miss Granger was actually being reasonable. Still, Rule Ten:
one must not rant about the opposition's unworthiness after they
have foiled you. Regardless. After two full hours of failed
attempts, I realized that I was being over-stubborn, and that I did
not need Miss Granger to carry out the exact part I had planned for
her. I gave up on my original intent, and instead imbued Miss
Granger with False Memories of watching Mr. Malfoy plotting against
her under circumstances that implied she should not tell you or the
authorities. In the end it was Mr. Malfoy who gave me the opening I
needed, entirely by luck." Professor Quirrell dropped a bellflower
and a scrap of parchment into the cauldron.</p>
<p>"Why did the wards show the Defense Professor as having killed
Hermione?"</p>
<p>"I wore the mountain troll as a false tooth while Dumbledore was
identifying me to the Hogwarts wards as the Defense Professor." A
slight smile. "Other living weapons cannot be Transfigured; they
will not survive the disenchantment for the requisite six hours to
avoid being traced by Time-Turner. The fact that a mountain troll
was used as a weapon of assassination was a clear sign that the
assassin had needed a proxy weapon that could be Transfigured
safely. Combined with the evidence of the wards, and Dumbledore's
own knowledge of how he had identified me to Hogwarts, you could
have deduced who was responsible - in theory. However, experience
has taught me that such puzzles are far harder to solve when you do
not already know the solution, and I considered it a small risk.
Ah, that reminds me, I have a question of my own." The Defense
Professor was now giving Harry an intent look. "What gave me away
at the last, in the corridor outside these chambers?"</p>
<p>Harry put aside other emotions to weigh up the cost and benefit
of answering honestly, came to the conclusion that the Defense
Professor was giving away far more information than he was getting
(<em>why?</em>) and that it was best not to give the appearance of
reticence. "The main thing," Harry said, "was that it was too
improbable that everyone had arrived in Dumbledore's corridor at
the same time. I tried running with the hypothesis that everyone
who arrived had to be coordinated, including you."</p>
<p>"But I had said that I was following Snape," the Defense
Professor said. "Was that not plausible?"</p>
<p>"It was, but..." Harry said. "Um. The laws governing what
constitutes a good explanation don't talk about plausible excuses
you hear afterward. They talk about the probabilities we assign in
advance. That's why science makes people do advance predictions,
instead of trusting explanations people come up with afterward. And
I wouldn't have predicted in advance for you to follow Snape and
show up like that. Even if I'd known in advance that you could put
a trace on Snape's wand, I wouldn't have <em>expected</em> you to
do it and follow him just then. Since your explanation didn't make
me feel like I would have predicted the outcome in advance, it
remained an improbability. I started to wonder if Sprout's
mastermind might have arranged for you to show up, too. And then I
realised the note to myself hadn't really come from future-me, and
that gave it away completely."</p>
<p>"Ah," said the Defense Professor, and sighed. "Well, I think it
is all working out for the best. You did understand only too late;
and there would have been inconveniences as well as benefits to you
remaining unaware."</p>
<p>"What on <em>Earth</em> were you trying to do? The reason I was
trying so hard to figure it out was that the whole thing was just
so weird."</p>
<p>"That should have pointed at Dumbledore, not myself," said
Professor Quirrell, and frowned. "The fact is that Miss Greengrass
was not supposed to arrive in that corridor for several hours...
though I suppose, since I did have Mr. Malfoy give her the clue I
assigned her, it is not too surprising they banded together. Had
Mr. Nott arrived seemingly alone, events would have played out less
farcically. But I consider myself a specialist in battlefield
control magics, and I was able to ensure that the fight went as I
wished. I suppose it did end up looking a bit ridiculous." The
Defense Professor dropped a peach slice and a bellflower into the
cauldron. "But let us defer our discussion of the Mirror until we
reach it. Did you have any more questions concerning Miss Granger's
regrettable and hopefully temporary demise?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said in an even voice. "What did you do to the
Weasley twins? Dumbledore thought - I mean, the school saw the
Headmaster go to the Weasley twins after Hermione was arrested.
Dumbledore thought you, as Voldemort, had wondered why Dumbledore
had done so, and that you'd checked on the Weasley twins, found and
took their map, and Obliviated them afterward?"</p>
<p>"Dumbledore was quite correct," Professor Quirrell said, shaking
his head as though in wonderment. "He was also an utter fool to
leave the Hogwarts Map in the possession of those two idiots. I had
an unpleasant shock after I recovered the Map; it showed my name
and yours correctly! The Weasley idiots had thought it a mere
malfunction, especially after you received your Cloak and your
Time-Turner. If Dumbledore had kept the Map himself - if the
Weasleys had ever spoken of it to Dumbledore - but they did not,
thankfully."</p>
<p><em>Showed my name and yours correctly -</em></p>
<p>"I would like to see that," Harry said.</p>
<p>Without taking his eyes from the cauldron, Professor Quirrell
drew a folded parchment from within his robes, hissed at it
<em>"Sshow our ssurroundingss</em>", and tossed the folded
parchment toward Harry. It cut unerringly through the air, an
increase of doom breathing on Harry's senses as it moved toward
him, and then it fluttered gently to Harry's feet.</p>
<p>Harry picked up the parchment and unfolded it.</p>
<p>At first the parchment seemed blank. Then, as though an unseen
pen were moving across it, the outline of walls and doors appeared,
all drawn in handwritten lines. The writing outlined a series of
chambers, most of them shown as empty; the last chamber in the
series had a confused scribble in its center, as though the Map
were trying to indicate its own bewilderment; and the
second-to-last chamber showed two names within, written in
positions within the chamber corresponding to where Harry was
sitting and Professor Quirrell was standing.</p>
<p><em>Tom M. Riddle.</em></p>
<p><em>Tom M. Riddle.</em></p>
<p>Harry gazed at the parchment, an unpleasant chill coming over
him. It was one thing to hear Lord Voldemort claim that your name
was Tom Riddle; it was another thing to find that Hogwarts's magic
agreed. "<em>Did you tamper with thiss map to achieve thiss
ressult, or did it appear before you by ssurprisse?"</em></p>
<p><em>"Wass ssurprisse,</em>" replied Professor Quirrell, with an
overtone of hissing laughter. "<em>No trickss.</em>"</p>
<p>Harry folded the Map and threw it back in Professor Quirrell's
direction; some force caught it in midair before it reached the
floor, and drew the Map back into Professor Quirrell's robes.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor spoke. "I should also like to volunteer
that Snape was guiding Miss Granger and her underlings toward
bullies, and sometimes intervening to protect them."</p>
<p>"I knew that."</p>
<p>"Interesting," said Professor Quirrell. "Did Dumbledore also
learn of this? Answer in Parseltongue."</p>
<p>"<em>Not sso far ass I know,</em>" hissed Harry.</p>
<p>"Fascinating," said Professor Quirrell. "You may be interested
to know this as well: <em>Potionss-maker had to work in ssecret
because hiss plot oppossed sschoolmasster's plot.</em>"</p>
<p>Harry thought about this, while Professor Quirrell blew on the
potion as though to cool it, though the fire still burned under the
cauldron; then added a pinch of dirt and a drop of water and a
bellflower. "Please explain," Harry said.</p>
<p>"Has it never occurred to you to wonder why Dumbledore chose
Severus Snape as the Head of House Slytherin? To say that it was a
cover for his work as Dumbledore's spy explains nothing. Snape
could have been a Potions Master only, and not the Head of
Slytherin at all. Snape could have been made Keeper of Grounds and
Keys, if he needed to stay within Hogwarts! Why the <em>Head of
House Slytherin?</em> Surely it occurred to you that this could not
have good effects upon the Slytherins, according to Dumbledore's
moral pretenses?"</p>
<p>The thought hadn't occurred to Harry in <em>exactly</em> those
terms, no... "I wondered something like it. I didn't put the
dilemma in that precise form."</p>
<p>"And now that you have, is the solution obvious?"</p>
<p>"No," Harry said.</p>
<p>"Disappointing. You have not learned enough cynicism, you have
not grasped the <em>flexibility</em> of what moralists call
morality. To fathom a plot, look at the consequences and ask if
they might be intended. Dumbledore was deliberately sabotaging
Slytherin House - don't give me that look, boy, <em>I am sspeaking
truth.</em> During the last Wizarding War, Slytherins filled out my
ranks of underlings, and other Slytherins in the Wizengamot
supported me. Look at it from Dumbledore's perspective, and
remember that he has no native understanding of Slytherin's ways.
Think of Dumbledore becoming increasingly sad over this Hogwarts
House that seems the source of so much ill-doing. And then behold,
Dumbledore puts in as Head of Slytherin the person of Snape. Snape!
Severus Snape! A man who would teach his House neither cunning nor
ambition, a man who would impose lax discipline and make its
children weak! A man who would offend students of other Houses, who
would ruin Slytherin's name among them! A man whose surname was
unknown in magical Britain and certainly not noble, who went about
half in rags! Do you think Dumbledore ignorant of the consequence?
When Dumbledore was the one who brought it about, and had motive to
bring it about? I expect Dumbledore told himself that more lives
would be saved during the next Wizarding War if Voldemort's future
Death Eaters were weakened." Professor Quirrell dropped into the
cauldron a chip of ice, slowly melting as it touched the surface
froth. "Continue the process long enough, and no child would want
to go to Slytherin. The House would be retired, and if the Hat kept
calling the name, it would become a mark of ignominy among children
who would afterward be distributed among the other three Houses.
From that day on, Hogwarts would have three upstanding Houses of
courage and scholarship and industry, with no House of Bad Children
added to the mix; just as if the three Founders of Hogwarts had
been wise enough in the beginning to refuse Salazar Slytherin their
company. That, I expect, was Dumbledore's intended end-game; a
short-term sacrifice for the greater good." Professor Quirrell
smiled sardonically. "And Lucius let it all happen without protest
or even, I expect, <em>noticing</em> that anything was going awry.
I fear that in my absence my former servants have been quite
outmatched in this battle of wits."</p>
<p>Harry was having a bit of trouble taking this in, but decided,
after some thought, that now was not the time to try to work it
out. Whether Lord Voldemort believed it was not decisive; Harry
would have to evaluate this accusation on his own.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's mention of his <em>servants</em> had
reminded Harry of something else that he was... obligated, Harry
supposed, to ask. The bad news was predictable. On any other day it
would have been horrible. Today it would just wash out in the
flood. "Bellatrix Black," Harry said. "What was the truth about
her?"</p>
<p>"She was broken inside before I ever met her," Professor
Quirrell said. He picked up what looked like a white-grey rubber
band and held it over the cauldron; as the rubber was held within
the steam, it turned black. "Using Legilimency on her was a
mistake. But that glimpse showed me how easy it would be to make
her fall in love with me, so I did. Ever after she was the most
faithful of all my servants, the only one I could almost trust. I
had no intention of giving her what she wanted from me; so I
commended her to the Lestrange brothers for their use, and the
three of them were happy in their own special way."</p>
<p>"I doubt it," Harry's mouth said, mostly on autopilot. "If that
were true, Bellatrix wouldn't have remembered who the Lestrange
brothers were, when we found her in Azkaban."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell shrugged. "You may be right."</p>
<p>"What the hell were we actually doing there?"</p>
<p>"Finding out where Bellatrix had put my wand. I had told the
Death Eaters of my immortality, in the hope - now proven futile -
that they would stay together for at least a few <em>days</em> if I
appeared to die. Bellatrix's instructions were to recover my wand
from wherever my body had been slain; and take that wand to a
certain graveyard where my spirit would appear before her."</p>
<p>Harry swallowed. The image came to him of Bellatrix Black
waiting, waiting, waiting at the graveyard, in increasing
desperation... it was no wonder she hadn't been thinking
strategically when she attacked the Longbottom household. "What did
you do with Bellatrix once she was out?"</p>
<p>"<em>Ssent her to a peaceful place to recover sstrength</em>,"
Professor Quirrell said. A cold smile. "I had a use remaining for
her, or rather a certain portion of her, and on my future plans I
shall not answer questions."</p>
<p>Harry breathed deeply, trying to maintain control. "Were there
any other secret plots in this school year?"</p>
<p>"Oh, a fair number, but not many more that concern you, not that
I can think of offhand. The true reason I demanded to try to teach
the Patronus Charm to first-years was to bring a Dementor before
your own person, and then I arranged for your wand to fall where
the Dementor could continue to drain you through it. <em>Wass no
malice in it, only hopess that you would recover ssome of your true
memoriess.</em> That was also why I arranged for certain witches to
pull you down from the air during your rooftop episode, so I could
appear to save your life; just in case any suspicion fell on me
during the Dementor incident I had scheduled for shortly after.
<em>Alsso no malice there.</em> I arranged some of the attacks on
Miss Granger's group, so that the attacks could be defeated; I do
rather dislike bullies. <em>Think that iss all ssecret plotss
concerning you from thiss sschool-year, unless I have forgotten
ssomething.</em>"</p>
<p><em>Life lesson learned,</em> said his Hufflepart. <em>Try to
resist the temptation to randomly meddle in other people's lives.
Like, you know, Padma Patil's life. If you don't want to end up
like this, that is.</em></p>
<p>A pinch of red-brown dust was gently sifted into the potions
cauldron, and Harry asked his fourth and final question, the one
that had seemed to have the lowest priority, but still
mattered.</p>
<p>"What was your objective during the Wizarding War?" Harry said.
"I mean, what -" His voice wobbled. "What was the <em>point</em> of
the <em>entire thing?</em> " His brain repeating endlessly,
<em>Why, why, why Lord Voldemort...</em></p>
<p>Professor Quirrell lifted an eyebrow. "They told you about David
Monroe, did they not?"</p>
<p>"Yes you were both David Monroe and Lord Voldemort during the
Wizarding War, I understood that part. You killed David Monroe,
disguised yourself as him, and wiped out David Monroe's family so
they wouldn't notice any differences -"</p>
<p>"Indeed."</p>
<p>"You planned to control whichever side won the Wizarding War,
regardless of which side won. But why did one side have to be
<em>Voldemort?</em> I, I mean, wouldn't it have been easier to gain
public support with someone less... with someone less
Voldemort?"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's mallet made an unusually loud <em>thud</em>
as it crushed white butterfly wings, mixing them with another
bellflower. "I <em>planned,</em>" Professor Quirrell said harshly,
"for Lord Voldemort to <em>lose</em> to David Monroe. The flaw in
that strategy was the absolute wretchedness of -" Professor
Quirrell stopped. "No, I am telling the tale out of order. Listen,
boy, when I had devised my great creation and come into the
fullness of my magic, I thought the time had come for me to take
political power into my hands. It would be inconvenient, certainly,
and take up my time in ways that were not enjoyable. But I knew the
Muggles would eventually destroy the world or make war on
wizardkind or both, and something had to be done if I was not to
wander a dead or dull world through my eternity. Having attained
immortality I needed a new ambition to occupy my decades, and to
prevent the Muggles from ruining everything seemed a goal of
acceptable scope and difficulty. It is a source of continual
amusement to me that I, of all people, am the only one really
taking action towards that end. Though I suppose it would make
sense for the mortal insects not to care about their world's end;
why should they, when they are just going to die regardless, and
can save themselves the inconvenience of trying to do anything
difficult along the way? But I digress. I saw how Dumbledore had
risen to power from his defeat of Grindelwald, so I thought I would
do the same. I had long ago taken my vengeance on David Monroe - he
was an annoyance from my year in Slytherin - so I bethought to also
steal his identity, and wipe out his family to make myself heir of
his House. And I conceived also a great foe for David Monroe to
fight, the most terrifying Dark Lord imaginable, clever beyond
reckoning; more dangerous by far than Grindelwald, for his
intelligence would be perfected in all the ways that Grindelwald
had been flawed and self-destructive. A Dark Lord who would do his
cunning utmost to disrupt the alliances who would fight him, a Dark
Lord who would command the deepest loyalty from his followers
through his oratical skills. The most dreadful Dark Lord who had
ever threatened Britain or the world, that was who David Monroe
would defeat."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's mallet struck a bellflower and then a
different pale flower with two more thuds. "But then, while I had
sometimes played the part of Dark Wizard in my wanderings, I had
never adopted the identity of a full-fledged Dark Lord with
underlings and a political agenda. I had no practice at the task,
and I was mindful of the story of Dark Evangel and the disaster of
her first public appearance. According to what she said afterward,
she had meant to call herself the Walking Catastrophe and the
Apostle of Darkness, but in the excitement of the moment she
introduced herself as the Apostrophe of Darkness instead. After
that she had to ruin two entire villages before anyone took her
seriously."</p>
<p>"So you decided to try a small-scale experiment first," Harry
said. A sickness rose up in him, because in that moment Harry
<em>understood,</em> he saw himself reflected; the next step was
just what Harry himself would have done, if he'd had no trace of
ethics whatsoever, if he'd been that empty inside. "You created a
disposable identity, to learn how the ropes worked, and get your
mistakes out of the way."</p>
<p>"Indeed. Before becoming a truly terrible Dark Lord for David
Monroe to fight, I first created for practice the persona of a Dark
Lord with glowing red eyes, pointlessly cruel to his underlings,
pursuing a political agenda of naked personal ambition combined
with blood purism as argued by drunks in Knockturn Alley. My first
underlings were hired in a tavern, given cloaks and skull masks,
and told to introduce themselves as Death Eaters."</p>
<p>The sick sense of understanding deepened, in the pit of Harry's
stomach. "And you called yourself Voldemort."</p>
<p>"Just so, General Chaos." Professor Quirrell was grinning, from
where he stood by the cauldron. "I wanted it to be an anagram of my
name, but that would only have worked if I'd conveniently been
given the middle name of 'Marvolo', and then it would have been a
stretch. Our actual middle name is Morfin, if you're curious. But I
digress. I thought Voldemort's career would last only a few months,
a year at the longest, before the Aurors brought down his
underlings and the disposable Dark Lord vanished. As you perceive,
I had vastly overestimated my competition. And I could not
<em>quite</em> bring myself to torture my underlings when they
brought me bad news, no matter what Dark Lords did in plays. I
could not <em>quite</em> manage to argue the tenets of blood purism
as incoherently as if I were a drunk in Knockturn Alley. I was not
trying to be clever when I sent my underlings on their missions,
but neither did I give them entirely pointless orders -" Professor
Quirrell gave a rueful grin that, in another context, might have
been called charming. "One month after that, Bellatrix Black
prostrated herself before me, and after three months Lucius Malfoy
was negotiating with me over glasses of expensive Firewhiskey. I
sighed, gave up all hope for wizardkind, and began as David Monroe
to oppose this fearsome Lord Voldemort."</p>
<p>"And then what happened -"</p>
<p>A snarl contorted Professor Quirrell's face. "The absolute
inadequacy of every single institution in the civilization of
magical Britain is what happened! You cannot comprehend it, boy! I
cannot comprehend it! It has to be seen and even then it cannot be
believed! You will have observed, perhaps, that of your fellow
students who speak of their family's occupations, three in four
seem to mention jobs in some part or another of the Ministry. You
will wonder how a country can manage to employ three of its four
citizens in bureaucracy. The answer is that if they did not all
prevent each other from doing their jobs, none of them would have
any work left to do! The Aurors were competent as individual
fighters, they did fight Dark Wizards and only the best survived to
train new recruits, but their leadership was in absolute disarray.
The Ministry was so busy routing papers that the country had
<em>no</em> effective opposition to Voldemort's attacks except
myself, Dumbledore, and a handful of untrained irregulars. A
shiftless, incompetent, cowardly layabout, Mundungus Fletcher, was
considered a key asset in the Order of the Phoenix - because, being
otherwise unemployed, he did not need to juggle another job! I
tried weakening Voldemort's attacks, to see if it was
<em>possible</em> for him to lose; at once the Ministry committed
fewer Aurors to oppose me! I had read Mao's Little Red Book, I had
trained my Death Eaters in guerilla tactics - for nothing! For
nothing! I was attacking all of magical Britain and in every
engagement my forces <em>outnumbered</em> their opposition! In
desperation, I ordered my Death Eaters to systematically
assassinate every single incompetent managing the Department of
Magical Law Enforcement. One paper-pusher after another volunteered
to accept higher positions despite the fate of their predecessors,
gleefully rubbing their hands at the prospect of promotion. Every
one of them thought they would cut a deal with Lord Voldemort on
the side. It took <em>seven months</em> to murder our way through
them all, and not a single Death Eater asked why we were bothering.
And then, even with Bartemius Crouch risen to Director and Amelia
Bones as Head Auror, it was still too little. I could have done
better fighting <em>alone.</em> Dumbledore's aid was not worth his
moral restraints, and Crouch's aid was not worth his respect for
the law." Professor Quirrell turned up the fire beneath the
potion.</p>
<p>"And eventually," Harry said through the heart-sickness, "you
realized you were just having more fun as Voldemort."</p>
<p>"It is the least annoying role I have ever played. If Lord
Voldemort says that something is to be done, people <em>obey
him</em> and <em>do not argue.</em> I did not have to suppress my
impulse to Cruciate people being idiots; for once it was all part
of the role. If someone was making the game less pleasant for me, I
just said <em>Avadakedavra</em> regardless of whether that was
strategically wise, and they never bothered me again." Professor
Quirrell casually chopped a small worm into bits. "But my true
epiphany came on a certain day when David Monroe was trying to get
an entry permit for an Asian instructor in combat tactics, and a
Ministry clerk denied it, smiling smugly. I asked the Ministry
clerk if he understood that this measure was meant to <em>save his
life</em> and the Ministry clerk only smiled more. Then in fury I
threw aside masks and caution, I used my Legilimency, I dipped my
fingers into the cesspit of his stupidity and <em>tore</em> out the
truth from his mind. I did not understand and I <em>wanted to
understand.</em> With my command of Legilimency I forced his tiny
clerk-brain to live out alternatives, seeing what his clerk-brain
would think of Lucius Malfoy, or Lord Voldemort, or Dumbledore
standing in my place." Professor Quirrell's hands had slowed, as he
delicately peeled bits and small strips from a chunk of candle-wax.
"What I finally realized that day is complicated, boy, which is why
I did not understand it earlier in life. To you I shall try to
describe it anyway. Today I know that Dumbledore does not stand at
the top of the world, for all that he is the Supreme Mugwump of the
International Confederation. People speak ill of Dumbledore openly,
they criticize him proudly and to his face, in a way they would not
dare stand up to Lucius Malfoy. <em>You</em> have acted
disrespectfully toward Dumbledore, boy, do you know why you did
so?"</p>
<p>"I'm... not sure," Harry said. Having Tom Riddle's leftover
neural patterns was certainly an obvious hypothesis.</p>
<p>"Wolves, dogs, even chickens, fight for dominance among
themselves. What I finally understood, from that clerk's mind, was
that to him Lucius Malfoy had dominance, Lord Voldemort had
dominance, and David Monroe and Albus Dumbledore did not. By taking
the side of good, by professing to abide in the light, we had made
ourselves <em>unthreatening.</em> In Britain, Lucius Malfoy has
dominance, for he can call in your loans, or send Ministry
bureaucrats against your shop, or crucify you in the <em>Daily
Prophet,</em> if you go openly against his will. And the most
powerful wizard in the world has no dominance, because everyone
knows that he is," Professor Quirrell's lips curled, "<em>a hero
out of stories,</em> relentlessly self-effacing and too humble for
vengeance. Tell me, child, have you ever seen a drama where the
hero, before he consents to save his country, demands so much gold
as a barrister might receive for a court case?"</p>
<p>"Actually there have been a <em>lot</em> of heroes like that in
Muggle fiction, I'll name Han Solo just to start-"</p>
<p>"Well, in magical drama it is not so. It is all humble heroes
like Dumbledore. It is the fantasy of the powerful <em>slave</em>
who will never truly rise above you, never demand your respect,
never even ask you for pay. Do you understand now?"</p>
<p>"I... think so," Harry said. Frodo and Samwise from <em>Lord of
the Rings</em> did seem to match the archetype of a completely
non-threatening hero. "You're saying that's how people think of
Dumbledore? I don't believe the Hogwarts students see him as a
hobbit."</p>
<p>"In Hogwarts, Dumbledore does punish certain transgressions
against his will, so he is feared to some degree - though the
students still make free to mock him in more than whispers. Outside
this castle, Dumbledore is sneered at; they began to call him mad,
and he aped the part like a fool. Step into the role of a savior
out of plays, and people see you as a slave to whose services they
are entitled and whom it is their enjoyment to criticize; for it is
the privilege of masters to sit back and call forth helpful
corrections while the slaves labor. Only in the tales of the
ancient Greeks, from when men were less sophisticated in their
delusions, may you see the hero who is also high. Hector, Aeneas,
those were heroes who retained their right of vengeance upon those
who insulted them, who could demand gold and jewels in payment for
their services without sparking indignation. And if Lord Voldemort
conquered Britain, he might then condescend to show himself noble
in victory; and nobody would take his goodwill for granted, nor
chirp corrections at him if his work was not to their liking. When
he won, he would have <em>true</em> respect. I understood that day
in the Ministry that by envying Dumbledore, I had shown myself as
deluded as Dumbledore himself. I understood that I had been trying
for the wrong place all along. You should know this to be true,
boy, for you have made freer to speak ill of Dumbledore than you
ever dared speak ill of me. Even in your own thoughts, I wager, for
instinct runs deep. You knew that it might be to your cost to mock
the strong and vengeful Professor Quirrell, but that there was no
cost in disrespecting the weak and harmless Dumbledore."</p>
<p>"Thank you," Harry said through the pain, "for that valuable
lesson, Professor Quirrell, I see that you are right about what my
mind was doing." Though Tom Riddle's memories had probably also had
something to do with the way he had sometimes lashed out at
Dumbledore for no good reason, Harry hadn't been like that around
Professor McGonagall... who admittedly had the power to deduct
House Points and didn't have Dumbledore's air of tolerance... no,
it was still true, Harry would have been more respectful even in
his own thoughts if Dumbledore had not seemed <em>safe</em> to
disrespect.</p>
<p>So that had been David Monroe, and that had been Lord
Voldemort...</p>
<p>It still hadn't answered the most puzzling question, and Harry
wasn't sure that asking it would be wise. If, somehow, Lord
Voldemort had managed <em>not to think of it,</em> and then
Professor Quirrell had still managed not to think of it during nine
years of contemplation, then it wasn't wise to say... or maybe it
was; the agonies of the Wizarding War had not been good for
Britain.</p>
<p>Harry decided, and spoke. "One thing that did confuse me was why
the Wizarding War lasted so long," Harry ventured. "I mean, maybe
I'm underestimating the difficulties that were facing Lord
Voldemort-"</p>
<p>"You want to know why I did not Imperius some of the stronger
wizards who could Imperius others, slay the very strongest wizards
who could have resisted my Imperius, and take over the Ministry in,
oh, perhaps three days."</p>
<p>Harry nodded silently.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell looked contemplative; his hand was sifting
grass clippings into the cauldron, bit by bit. That ingredient, if
Harry remembered correctly, was something like four-fifths towards
the end of the recipe.</p>
<p>"I wondered that myself," the Defense Professor said finally,
"when I heard Trelawney's prophecy from Snape, and I contemplated
the past as well as the future. If you had asked my past self why
he did not use the Imperius, he would have spoken of the need to be
<em>seen</em> to rule, to openly command the Ministry bureaucracy,
before it was time to turn his eyes outward to other countries. He
would have remarked on how a quick and silent victory might bring
challenges later. He would have remarked on the obstacle presented
by Dumbledore and his incredible defensive prowess. And he would
have had similar excuses for every other quick path he considered.
Somehow it was never the right time to bring my plans to their
final phase, there was always one more thing to do first. Then I
heard the prophecy and I <em>knew</em> that it was time, for Time
itself was taking notice of me. That the span for hesitation was
done. And I looked back, and realised somehow this had been going
on for years. I think..." The occasional bit of grass was still
dropping down from his hand, but Professor Quirrell did not seem to
pay it any mind. "I thought, when I was contemplating my past
beneath the starlight, that I had become too accustomed to playing
against Dumbledore. Dumbledore was intelligent, he tried diligently
to be cunning, he did not wait for me to strike but presented me
with surprises. He made bizarre moves that played out in
fascinating and unpredictable ways. In retrospect, there were many
obvious plans for destroying Dumbledore; but I think some part of
me did not want to go back to playing solitaire instead of chess.
It was when I had the prospect of creating another Tom Riddle to
plot against, someone even more worthy than Dumbledore, that I was
first willing to contemplate the end of my war. Yes, in retrospect
that sounds stupid, but sometimes our emotions are more foolish
than we can bring our reason to admit. I would never have espoused
such a policy deliberately. It would have violated Rules Nine,
Sixteen, Twenty, and Twenty-two and that is too much even if you
are enjoying yourself. But to repeatedly decide that there was one
more thing left to be done, one more advantage left to be gained,
one more piece that I simply <em>had</em> to move into place,
before abandoning an enjoyable time in my life and moving on to the
more tedious rulership of Britain... well, even I am not immune to
a mistake like that, if I do not realize that I am making it."</p>
<p>And that was when Harry knew what was going to happen at the end
of this, after the Philosopher's Stone had been retrieved.</p>
<p>At the end of this, Professor Quirrell was going to kill
him.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell didn't want to kill him. It was possible that
Harry was the only person in the world against whom Professor
Quirrell <em>wouldn't</em> be able to use a Killing Curse. But
Professor Quirrell thought he had to do it, for whatever
reason.</p>
<p>That was why Professor Quirrell had decided that it was
necessary to brew the <em>potion of effulgence</em> the long way.
That was why Professor Quirrell had been so easily negotiated into
answering these questions, into finally talking about his life with
someone who might understand. Just like Lord Voldemort had delayed
the end of the Wizarding War to play longer against Dumbledore.</p>
<p>Harry couldn't exactly recall what Professor Quirrell had said
earlier about not killing Harry. It hadn't been anything
straightforward along the lines of 'I am absolutely not planning to
kill you in any way, shape, or form unless you positively insist on
doing something stupid'. Harry had been reluctant himself to push
the promise too far and insist on unambiguous terms because Harry
had already known that he would need to neutralize Lord Voldemort
and had expected more precise language to reveal that fact, if they
tried to exchange truly binding promises. So there certainly would
have been loopholes, whatever had been said.</p>
<p>There was no particular shock to the realization, just an
increased sense of urgency; some part of Harry had already known
this, and had simply been waiting for an excuse to make it known to
deliberation. There had been too many things said here that
Professor Quirrell would not reveal to anyone with an expected
lifespan measured in more than hours. The overwhelming isolation
and loneliness of the life Professor Quirrell had described might
explain why he was willing to violate his Rules and talk with
Harry, <em>given</em> that Harry was going to die soon and that the
world did not actually work like a play where the villain
disclosing his plans would always fail to kill the hero afterward.
But Harry's death certainly had to be in those future plans
somewhere.</p>
<p>Harry swallowed, controlling his breathing. Professor Quirrell
had just added a tuft of horsehair to the <em>potion of
effulgence,</em> and that was very late in the potion, if Harry
remembered correctly. There weren't many bellflowers left in the
heap to be added, either.</p>
<p>It was probably time to stop worrying so much about risk and
play this conversation less conservatively, all things
considered.</p>
<p>"If I point out one of Lord Voldemort's mistakes," Harry said,
"does he punish me for it?"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell lifted his eyebrows. "Not if the mistake is a
real one. I do not suggest that you moralise at me. But I would not
curse the bearer of bad news, nor the subordinate who makes an
honest attempt to point out a problem. Even as Lord Voldemort I
could never bring myself to that stupidity. Of course, there were
some fools who mistook my policy for weakness, who tried to thrust
themselves forward by pushing me down in their public counsel,
thinking me obliged to tolerate it as criticism." Professor
Quirrell smiled reminiscently. "The Death Eaters were better off
without them, and I do not advise you make the same mistake."</p>
<p>Harry nodded, a slight shiver going through him. "Um, when you
told me about what happened in Godric's Hollow, on Halloween night,
in 1981 I mean, um... I thought I saw another flaw in your
reasoning. A way you could have avoided disaster. But, um, I think
you have a blind spot, a class of strategies you don't consider, so
you didn't see it even afterward-"</p>
<p>"I hope you are not about to say anything stupid along the lines
of 'don't try to kill people'," Professor Quirrell said. "I shall
be unhappy if that is the case."</p>
<p>"<em>Not valuess difference. True misstake, given your goalss.
Will you hurt me, if I act the part of the teacher toward you, and
teach lessson? Or if misstake is ssimple and obviousss, and makess
you feel sstupid?"</em></p>
<p>"<em>No,</em>" hissed Professor Quirrell. "<em>Not if lessson
iss true.</em>"</p>
<p>Harry swallowed. "Um. Why didn't you test the horcrux system
before you actually had to use it?"</p>
<p>"Test it?" said Professor Quirrell. He looked up from the
brewing potion, and indignation came into his voice. "What do you
mean, <em>test it?</em> "</p>
<p>"Why didn't you test if the horcrux system was working
correctly, before you needed it on Halloween?"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell looked disgusted. "You ridiculous - I didn't
want to <em>die,</em> Mr. Potter, and that was the only way to test
my great creation! What good would it have done to risk my life
sooner rather than later? How would I have been better off?"</p>
<p>Harry swallowed a lump in his throat. "<em>There wass way for
you to tesst your horcrux ssysstem without dying.</em> The general
lesson is important. Do you see it now?"</p>
<p>"No," Professor Quirrell said after a while. The Defense
Professor gently crumbled one of the last bellflowers together with
a strand of long blonde hair and then dropped it into the potion,
which was bubbling brighter, now. Only two more bellflowers
remained on the Potions table. "And I do hope your lesson is a
sensible one, for your sake."</p>
<p>"Suppose, Professor, that I learned how to cast the improved
horcrux spell and I was willing to use it. What would I do with
it?"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell answered at once. "You would find some person
whom you found morally abhorrent and whose death you could convince
yourself would save other lives, and murder them to create a
horcrux."</p>
<p>"And then what?"</p>
<p>"Make more horcruxes," said the Defense Professor. He picked up
a jar of what looked like dragon scales.</p>
<p>"Before that," Harry said.</p>
<p>After a time the Defense Professor shook his head. "I still do
not see it, and you will cease this game and tell me."</p>
<p>"I would make horcruxes for my friends. If you'd ever really
cared about one single other person in the entire world, if there'd
been just one person who gave your immortality <em>meaning,</em>
someone that you wanted to live forever <em>with</em> you -"
Harry's throat choked. "Then, then the idea of making a horcrux for
someone else wouldn't have been such a counterintuitive thought."
Harry was blinking hard. "You have a blind spot around strategies
that involve doing nice things for other people, to the point where
it stops you from achieving your selfish values. You think... it's
not your style, I suppose. That... particular part of your
self-image... is what cost you those nine years."</p>
<p>The dropper of mint oil that the Defense Professor was holding
added liquid to the cauldron, drip by drip.</p>
<p>"I see..." the Defense Professor said slowly. "I see. I should
have taught Rabastan the advanced horcrux ritual, and forced him to
test the invention. Yes, that is supremely obvious in retrospect.
For that matter, I could have ordered Rabastan to try marking
himself onto some disposable infant, to see what happened, before I
took myself to Godric's Hollow to create you." Professor Quirrell
shook his head bemusedly. "Well. I am glad I am realizing this now
and not ten years earlier; I had enough to chide myself for at that
time."</p>
<p>"You don't see nice ways to do <em>the things you want to
do,</em>" Harry said. His ears heard a note of desperation in his
own voice. "Even when a nice strategy would be <em>more
effective</em> you don't see it because you have a self-image of
<em>not being nice.</em>"</p>
<p>"That is a fair observation," said Professor Quirrell. "Indeed,
now that you have pointed it out, I have just now thought of some
nice things I can do this very day, to further my agenda."</p>
<p>Harry just looked at him.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was smiling. "Your lesson is a good one, Mr.
Potter. From now on, until I learn the trick of it, I shall keep
diligent watch for cunning strategies that involve doing kindnesses
for other people. Go and practice acts of goodwill, perhaps, until
my mind goes there easily."</p>
<p>Cold chills ran down Harry's spine.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell had said this without the slightest visible
hesitation.</p>
<p>Lord Voldemort was absolutely certain that he could never be
redeemed. He wasn't the tiniest bit afraid of it happening to
him.</p>
<p>The second-to-last bellflower was dropped into the potion,
gently.</p>
<p>"Any other valuable lessons you would like to teach to Lord
Voldemort, boy?" said Professor Quirrell. He was looking up from
the potion, and grinning as though he knew exactly what Harry was
thinking.</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said, his voice almost breaking. "If your goal is
to obtain happiness, then doing nice things for other people feels
better than doing them for yourself-"</p>
<p>"Do you <em>really</em> think I never thought of that, boy?" The
smile had vanished. "Do you think I am stupid? After graduating
Hogwarts I wandered the world for years, before I returned to
Britain as Lord Voldemort. I have put on more faces than I bothered
counting. Do you think I never tried to play the hero, just to see
how it would feel? Have you come across the name of Alexander
Chernyshov? Under that guise, I sought out a forlorn hellhole ruled
over by a Dark Wizard, and I freed the wretched inhabitants from
their bondage. They wept tears of gratitude for me. It did not feel
like anything in particular. I even stayed about and killed the
next five Dark Wizards to try taking command of the place. I spent
my own Galleons - well, not my own Galleons, but the same principle
applies - to prettify their little country and introduce a
semblance of order. They groveled all the more, and named one in
three of their infants Alexander. I still felt nothing, so I nodded
to myself, wrote it off as a fair try, and went upon my way."</p>
<p>"And were you happy as Lord Voldemort, then?" Harry's voice had
risen, grown wild.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell hesitated, then shrugged. "It appears you
already know the answer to that."</p>
<p>"Then <em>why?</em> Why be Voldemort if it <em>doesn't even make
you happy?</em> " Harry's voice broke. "I'm <em>you</em>, I'm based
on you, so <em>I know</em> that Professor Quirrell isn't just a
mask! I <em>know</em> he's somebody you really could have been! Why
not just stay that way? Take your curse off the Defense Position
and just <em>stay here</em>, use the Philosopher's Stone to take
David Monroe's shape and let the real Quirinus Quirrell go free, if
you say you'll stop killing people I'll swear not to tell anyone
who you really are, just <em>be Professor Quirrell,</em> for
always! Your students <em>would</em> appreciate you, my father's
students appreciate <em>him</em> -"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was chuckling over the cauldron as he stirred
it. "There are perhaps fifteen thousand wizards living in magical
Britain, child. There used to be more. There's a reason they're
afraid to speak my name. You'd forgive me that because you liked my
Battle Magic lessons?"</p>
<p><em>Seconded,</em> said Harry's inner Hufflepuff. <em>Seriously,
what the hell?</em></p>
<p>Harry kept his head raised, though it was trembling. "It's not
my place to forgive anything you've done. But it's better than
another war."</p>
<p>"Ha," said the Defense Professor. "If you ever find a
Time-Turner that goes back forty years and can alter history, be
sure to tell Dumbledore that before he rejects Tom Riddle's
application for the Defense position. But alas, I fear that
Professor Riddle would not have found lasting happiness in
Hogwarts."</p>
<p>"<em>Why not?</em> "</p>
<p>"Because I still would've been surrounded by idiots, and I
wouldn't have been able to kill them," Professor Quirrell said
mildly. "Killing idiots is my great joy in life, and I'll thank you
not to speak ill of it until you've tried it for yourself."</p>
<p>"There's <em>something</em> that would make you happier than
that," Harry said, his voice breaking again. "There has to be."</p>
<p>"Why?" said Professor Quirrell. "Is this some scientific law I
have not yet encountered? Tell me of it."</p>
<p>Harry opened his mouth, but couldn't find any words, there had
to be something <em>had to be something</em> if he could just find
the right thing to say -</p>
<p>"And <em>you</em>," said Professor Quirrell, "have no right to
speak of happiness either. Happiness is not what you hold precious
above all. You decided that in the beginning, all the way back in
the beginning of this year, when the Sorting Hat offered you
Hufflepuff. Which I know about, because I received a similar offer
and warning all those years ago, and I refused it just as you did.
Beyond this there is little more to say, between Tom Riddles." The
Defense Professor turned back to the cauldron.</p>
<p>Before Harry could think of any way to reply, Professor Quirrell
dropped in the last bellflower, and a burst of glowing bubbles
boiled up from the cauldron.</p>
<p>"I believe we are done here," Professor Quirrell said. "If you
have further questions, they must wait."</p>
<p>Harry shakily rose to his feet; even as Professor Quirrell took
up the cauldron and poured out a ridiculously huge volume of
effulgent liquid, more than seemed like it could fit in a dozen
cauldrons, onto the purple fire that guarded the doorway.</p>
<p>The purple fire winked out.</p>
<p>"Now for the Mirror," said Professor Quirrell, and he drew forth
the Cloak of Invisibility from his robes, and floated it to drop
before Harry's shoes.</p>

<p>The gibbous moon riding higher in the cloudless sky, the stars
and wash of the Milky Way visible in all their majesty within the
darkness: All these illuminated thirty-seven skull masks gleaming
above black robes, and the darker-clad Lord Voldemort, whose eyes
shone red.</p>
<p>"Welcome, my Death Eaters," spoke Lord Voldemort's voice, smooth
and high and terrible. "No, do not look at me, you fools! Eyes upon
the Potter child! Ten years, it has been, ten years since we last
met. Yet you answer my call as though it were yesterday..." The
Dark Lord Voldemort came near to one hooded figure, tapped fingers
upon the mask. "In a hastily Transfigured <em>mockery</em> of a
Death Eater's true armor, with a childish Charm to distort your
voice. Explain, Mr. Honor."</p>
<p>"Our old masks and robes..." said the robe whose mask the Dark
Lord had tapped. Even through the distorting timbre of the mask,
the fear in it was audible. "We... we were not fighting in them,
Master, with you gone... so I did not maintain their
enchantments... and then you summoned me to appear here, masked,
and I... I always held faith in you, Master, but I did not know you
would return this very day... I am truly sorry to have displeased
you..."</p>
<p>"Enough." The Dark Lord moved on to stand behind another figure,
that seemed to tremble, though it kept its mask facing the
Boy-Who-Lived, and its wand held level. "I might think more kindly
of such neglect, if you had pursued my agenda by other means... Mr.
Counsel. Yet I return to find - what? A country conquered in my
name?" The high voice climbed higher. "No! I find you playing
ordinary politics in the Wizengamot! I find your brothers still
abandoned in Azkaban! It is a disappointment to me... I confess
myself disappointed... You thought I was gone, the Dark Mark dead,
and you forsook my purpose. Is that right, Mr. Counsel?"</p>
<p>"No, Master!" cried that masked figure. "We knew you would
return - but, but we could not fight Dumbledore without you -"</p>
<p>"<em>Crucio.</em>"</p>
<p>A horrible scream tore out of the mask, piercing the night, it
continued for long, long seconds.</p>
<p>"Get up," the Dark Lord said to the figure that had collapsed
upon the ground. "Keep your wand on Harry Potter. <em>Do not lie to
me again.</em>"</p>
<p>"Yes, Master," sobbed the figure, as it pushed itself to its
feet.</p>
<p>Voldemort resumed pacing behind the black-robed figures. "I
suppose you are also wondering what Harry Potter is doing here...
Why he is a guest at my rebirthing party."</p>
<p>"I know, Master!" said one of the robes. "You mean to prove your
power by killing him, in front of us all, to leave no doubt as to
which of you is stronger! To show how your Killing Curse can slay
even this so-called Boy-Who-Lived!"</p>
<p>There was a pause. None of the cloaked figures dared to
speak.</p>
<p>Slowly, the Dark Lord Voldemort, in his high-collared shirt and
dark robes, turned to face the Death Eater who had spoken.</p>
<p>"That," whispered Voldemort in a voice chill as death, "is a
little too much folly for me to credit, Mr. Sallow. You heard that
theory of how I died, and tried to provoke me into repeating a
mistake?" Lord Voldemort was floating, rising high off the ground.
"I suppose you came to prefer your laziness to my mastery,
<em>Macnair?</em> "</p>
<p>The Death Eater who'd spoken was suddenly surrounded by a blue
haze. He spun, slashed his wand at the Dark Lord, and cried
"<em>Avada Kedavra!</em> "</p>
<p>Voldemort simply tilted to one side in midair, dodging the green
bolt.</p>
<p>"<em>Avada Kedavra!</em> " cried the Death Eater. His hand that
didn't hold a wand was making other gestures, further colors and
layers building up in his shielding haze with each gesture
completed. "Help me, my brothers! If we all -"</p>
<p>The Death Eater fell in seven flaming pieces to the ground,
chunks of flesh with the cauterized edges still glowing.</p>
<p>"Eyes and wands on Harry Potter, all of you," Voldemort
repeated, his voice low and dangerous. "And Macnair acted in sheer
stupidity just then, for I command your Marks, as I <em>always</em>
shall. <em>I am immortal.</em>"</p>
<p>"Master," said another robe. "The girl upon the altar - is she
to serve us for a Dark Revel? She seems unworthy of such a joyous
occasion. I could find better, Master, if you give me leave for
just a short time -"</p>
<p>"No, Mr. Friendly," said Voldemort, sounding rather amused. "The
little witch you see upon the altar is none other than Hermione
Granger -"</p>
<p>"What?" cried one of the black robes, and then, "I'm sorry,
Master, I'm sorry, I beg your -"</p>
<p>"<em>Crucio.</em>" This screaming only lasted a few seconds, and
Voldemort had performed it as though it were perfunctory. Afterward
Voldemort's voice returned to low amusement. "I have resurrected
this mudblood through the Darkest of magics, for my own purposes.
You shall not offer her the slightest trouble, any of you. You are
better off dead than if I learn my little experiment came to harm
at your hands. This order is absolute, regardless of other
circumstances - even if she escapes, let us say." A cold high
laugh, as if at some joke that nobody else understood.</p>
<p>"Master," one of the robes said in a faltering voice distorted
by his skull mask. "Master, please - I would never defy you, I am
obedient as you see - but Master, I beg you, let me return, the
better to serve you later - I came here in haste, forsaking -
Master, with so many of us being gone, others will wonder, they
will mark the absences, who has disappeared. Soon there shall be no
alibi I can offer."</p>
<p>A cold high laugh. "Ah, Mr. White, the most delinquent of my
servants. I have not yet decided if you will survive your
punishment. I have less need of you than I once did, Mr. White. In
two days' time the Death Eaters shall walk openly. My powers have
increased, and I have just this day disposed of Dumbledore." More
gasps of shock arose from the Death Eaters, Voldemort paid them no
heed. "Tomorrow I shall slay Bones, Crouch, Moody, and Scrimgeour,
if they have not fled. The rest of you shall go into the Ministry
and the Wizengamot, and cast Imperius Curses as I direct you. We
are <em>finished</em> waiting. By tomorrow's nightfall I shall have
declared myself Lord Ruler of Britain!"</p>
<p>Intakes of breath rose from the gathered masks, but one figure
was laughing.</p>
<p>"You find me amusing, Mr. Grim?"</p>
<p>"Apologies, Master," said the robed figure who had laughed, his
wand perfectly level upon where Harry stood. "I was glad to hear
you had dispatched Dumbledore. I fled from Britain in cowardly fear
of him, having lost faith in your return."</p>
<p>Voldemort's chuckle resounded within the graveyard. "Your candor
earns you my mercy, Mr. Grim. I was surprised to see you here
tonight; you are more competent than I suspected. But before we
turn our attention to happier matters, there is a certain affair to
which we must attend. Tell me, Mr. Grim, if the Boy-Who-Lived swore
an oath to you, might you trust him?"</p>
<p>"Master... I don't understand..." said Mr. Grim. One or two of
the other Death Eaters turned their masks toward Voldemort before
quickly fixing the skull gaze on Harry.</p>
<p>"Answer me," Voldemort hissed. "This is not a trick, Mr. Grim,
and you <em>will</em> answer truthfully or bear the consequences.
You knew the boy's forebears, did you not? Knew them for
straightforward folk? If the boy freely chose to swear to you an
oath, even knowing you for a Death Eater, might you trust in his
words? Answer me!" Voldemort's voice rose to a shriek.</p>
<p>"I... yes, Master, I suppose I might..."</p>
<p>"Good," Voldemort said coldly. "The potential for trust must
exist, to be sacrificed. And for the bonder of the Unbreakable
Vow... which of you shall sacrifice their magic? It shall be quite
the long Vow... much longer than usual... much magic shall be
required for that..." Voldemort smiled his awful smile. "Mr. White
shall do."</p>
<p>"No, please! <em>Master, I beg you!</em> I served you better
than any - as best I could -"</p>
<p>"<em>Crucio,</em>" said Voldemort, and Mr. White screamed
through his mask's distortion for what seemed like a full minute.
"Be grateful if I leave you your life! Now approach the boy, Mr.
Grim, Mr. White. From behind him, idiot! You must not block the
others' wands! And the rest of you, you must fire if Harry Potter
tries to run, even if it means striking at your fellow Death
Eaters."</p>
<p>Mr. White took time to approach, the black robes seeming to
shake, even as Mr. Grim moved smoothly into position.</p>
<p>"What is to be the Vow, Master?" came the voice of Mr. Grim.</p>
<p>"Ah, yes," Voldemort said. The Dark Lord went on pacing behind
the semicircle of Death Eaters. "Today - though I hardly expect
even you to believe me - today we are doing Merlin's work, my Death
Eaters. Yes! Before us stands a great danger, who in his blundering
folly has been prophesied to wreak destruction such as even I can
scarcely imagine. The Boy-Who-Lived! The boy who frightens
<em>Dementors!</em> The cattle who believe they own this world
should have been more worried when they saw that. Useless, all of
them!"</p>
<p>"Forgive me -" said one black robe in a halting voice. "Master -
surely, if that is so - Master, why don't we just kill him right
away?"</p>
<p>Voldemort laughed, a strange bitter laugh. When he spoke on his
high voice was precise. "Here is the oath's intent, Mr. Grim, Mr.
White, Harry Potter. Listen well and comprehend the Vow that must
be sworn, for its intent is also binding, and you three must share
an understanding of its meaning. You will swear, Harry Potter, not
to destroy the world, to take no risks when it comes to not
destroying the world. This Vow may <em>not</em> force you into any
positive action, on account of that, this Vow does not force your
hand to any stupidity. Do you understand that, Mr. Grim, Mr. White?
We are dealing with a prophecy of destruction. A <em>prophecy!</em>
They can fulfill themselves in twisted ways. We must be cautious
that this Vow itself does not bring that prophecy about. We dare
not let this Vow force Harry Potter to stand idly after some
disaster is already set in motion by his hand, because he must take
some lesser risk if he tries to stop it. Nor must the Vow force him
to choose a risk of truly vast destruction, over a certainty of
lesser destruction. But all Harry Potter's <em>foolishness,</em>"
Voldemort's voice climbed, "all his <em>recklessness,</em> all his
<em>grandiose schemes</em> and <em>good intentions</em> - he shall
not risk them leading to disaster! He shall not gamble with the
Earth's fate! No researches that might lead to catastrophe! No
unbinding of seals, no opening of gates!" Voldemort's voice lowered
again. "Unless this very Vow itself is somehow leading into the
destruction of the world, in which case, Harry Potter, you must
ignore it in that particular regard. You will <em>not</em> trust
yourself alone in making such a determination, you must confide
honestly and fully in your trusted friend, and see if that one
agrees. Such is this Vow's meaning and intent. It forces only such
acts as Harry Potter might choose himself, having learned that he
is a prophesied instrument of destruction. For the capacity for
choice must also exist, to be sacrificed. Do you understand, Mr.
White?"</p>
<p>"I - I think so - oh, Master, <em>please,</em> do not let the
Vow be so long -"</p>
<p>"Silence, fool, you do a more useful thing this day than you
have ever done. Mr. Grim?"</p>
<p>"I think, Master, that it must be repeated to me."</p>
<p>Voldemort smiled that too-wide smile, and said it all again
using different words.</p>
<p>"And now," Voldemort said coldly, "Harry Potter, you will keep
your wand low, and permit Mr. Grim to touch his wand to yours; and
you will speak such words as I direct you. If Harry Potter speaks
any other word, then cut him down, the rest of you."</p>
<p>"Yes, Master," came the thirty-four-fold chorus.</p>
<p>Harry was chilled, and shivering, and not only because he was
naked in the night. He didn't understand why Voldemort was
<em>not</em> just killing him. There seemed to be only a single
line leading into the future, and it was Voldemort's chosen line,
and Harry did not know what came after this.</p>
<p>"Mr. White," said Voldemort. "Touch your wand to Harry Potter's
hand, and repeat these words. Magic that flows in me, bind this
Vow."</p>
<p>Mr. White spoke those words. Even through the distortion effect
of his mask, it sounded as though his heart were breaking.</p>
<p>Behind Voldemort the obelisks chanted, a language that Harry did
not know; three times they repeated their words, then fell
silent.</p>
<p>"Mr. Grim," said Voldemort. "Think of the reasons why you might
trust this boy, if he had given this oath freely. Think of that
potential for trust, and <em>sacrifice</em> it as you say..."</p>
<p>"By my trust that I hold for you," said Mr. Grim, "be you
held."</p>
<p>And then it was Harry Potter's turn to repeat Lord Voldemort's
words, and Harry did so.</p>
<p>"I vow..." Harry said. His voice shook, but he spoke. "That I
shall not... by any act of mine... destroy the world... I shall
take no chances... in not destroying the world... if my hand is
forced... I may take the course... of lesser destruction over
greater destruction... unless it seems to me that this Vow
itself... leads to the world's end... and the friend... in whom I
have confided honestly... agrees that this is so. By my own free
will..." Harry could feel it, as the rite was invoked, the shining
cords of power wrapping around his wand and Mr. Grim's wand,
wrapping around his hand where Mr. White's wand touched it,
wrapping around his <em>self</em> on some disturbingly abstract
level. Harry could feel himself <em>invoking</em> his power of free
choice, and he knew that his next words would <em>sacrifice</em>
it, that this was absolutely the last chance to turn back.</p>
<p>"...so shall it be," said the coldly precise voice of Lord
Voldemort.</p>
<p>"...so shall it be," Harry repeated, and he knew in that moment
that the content of the Vow was no longer something he could decide
whether or not to do, it was simply the way in which his body and
mind would move. It was not a vow he could break even by
sacrificing his life in the process. Like water flowing downhill or
a calculator summing numbers, it was just a
thing-Harry-Potter-would-do.</p>
<p>"Did the Vow take, Mr. White?"</p>
<p>Mr. White sounded like he was weeping. "Yes, Master... I have
lost so much, please, I have been punished enough."</p>
<p>"Return to your places..." said Voldemort. "Good. All eyes on
the Potter child, prepare to fire the instant he tries to flee, or
raise his wand, or speak any word..." The Dark Lord floated high in
the air, the black-clad figure overlooking the graveyard. Again he
held a gun in his left hand, and his wand in his right. "Better.
<em>Now</em> we shall kill the Boy-Who-Lived."</p>
<p>Mr. White staggered. Mr. Grim was laughing again, and so were
others.</p>
<p>"I did not do that to be funny," Voldemort said coldly. "We are
dealing with a <em>prophecy</em>, fools. We are snipping the
threads of destiny one by one; carefully, carefully, not knowing
when we may first encounter resistance. This is the order in which
the next acts shall be done. First Harry Potter shall be stunned,
then his limbs severed and the wounds cauterized. Mr. Friendly and
Mr. Honor will examine him for any trace of unusual magics. One of
you shall shoot the boy many times with my Muggle weapon, and then
as many of you as can shall strike him with the Killing Curse. Only
then will Mr. Grim crush his skull and brains with the mundane
substance of a tombstone. I shall verify his corpse, then his
corpse shall be burned with Fiendfyre, then we will exorcise the
surrounding area in case he has left a ghost. I myself will guard
this place until six hours have passed, for I do not fully trust
the wards I have set; and four of you shall search the surroundings
for signs of anything noteworthy. Even after that we must remain
vigilant for any sign of Harry Potter's renewed presence, in case
Dumbledore has left some unimagined trick in play. If you can think
of any trick that I have missed in being sure that Harry Potter's
threat is ended, speak now and I shall reward you handsomely...
speak now, in Merlin's name!"</p>
<p>There was stunned silence amid the cemetary; no one made to
speak.</p>
<p>"Useless, the lot of you," Voldemort said with bitter scorn.
"Now I shall ask Harry Potter one final question, and he is to
answer that question for my ears alone, in Parseltongue. Strike the
boy down at once if he answers with anything but hisses, if he
tries to speak one word of human speech." Then Voldemort hissed,
"<em>Power I know not, it wass ssaid that you would have. The
Muggle Artss I have now learned of from you, and I am already
sstudying them. Your power over life-eaterss musst be comprehended
for onesself, or sso you ssay. If there iss any other power you
posssesss, that I may come to have, tell me of it now. Elsse, I
intend to torment certain of thosse you care for. Ssome livess I
have already promissed you, but otherss I did not. Your mudblood
sservantss in your little army. Your preciouss parentss. All sshall
ssuffer for what will sseem to them like eternitiess; and then I
sshall ssend them, broken, into the life-eater prisson to remember
it, until they wasste and die. For each unknown power you tell me
how to masster, or other ssecret you tell me that I desire to know,
you may name one more of thosse to insstead be protected and
honored under my reign. Thiss alsso I promisse and intend to
keep.</em>" Voldemort's smiling expression now came through as if
it were a snake's gaping fangs, and the meaning that expression
bore among snakes, a promise that whoever beheld the teeth was to
be consumed by them. "<em>Wasste not time in thoughtss of esscape,
if you care for thosse oness. You have ssixty ssecondss to begin
telling me ssomething I wissh to know, and then your death
beginss."</em></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><em>This is your final exam.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>You have 60 hours.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Your solution must at least allow
Harry to evade immediate death,</em><br>
<em>despite being naked, holding only his wand, facing 36 Death
Eaters</em><br>
<em>plus the fully resurrected Lord Voldemort.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><strong>If a viable solution is
posted before</strong></em><br>
<em><strong>*12:01AM Pacific Time* (8:01AM UTC) on Tuesday, March
3rd, 2015,</strong></em><br>
<em><strong>the story will continue to Ch. 121.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><strong>Otherwise you will get a
shorter and sadder ending.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Keep in mind the
following:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>1. Harry must succeed via his own
efforts. The cavalry is not coming.<br>
Everyone who might want to help Harry thinks he is at a Quidditch
game.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>2. Harry may only use
capabilities the story has already shown him to have;</em><br>
<em>he cannot develop wordless wandless Legilimency in the next 60
seconds.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>3. Voldemort is evil and cannot
be persuaded to be good;</em><br>
<em>the Dark Lord's utility function cannot be changed by talking
to him.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>4. If Harry raises his wand or
speaks in anything except Parseltongue,</em><br>
<em>the Death Eaters will fire on him immediately.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>5. If the simplest timeline is
otherwise one where Harry dies -</em><br>
<em>if Harry cannot reach his Time-Turner without Time-Turned help
-</em><br>
<em>then the Time-Turner will not come into play.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>6. It is impossible to tell lies
in Parseltongue.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Within these
constraints,</em><br>
<em>Harry is allowed to attain his full potential as a
rationalist,</em><br>
<em>now in this moment or never,</em><br>
<em>regardless of his previous flaws.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Of course 'the rational
solution',</em><br>
<em>if you are using the word 'rational' correctly,</em><br>
<em>is just a needlessly fancy way of saying 'the best
solution'</em><br>
<em>or 'the solution I like' or 'the solution I think we should
use',</em><br>
<em>and you should usually say one of the latter instead.<br>
(We only need the word 'rational' to talk about ways of
thinking,<br>
considered apart from any particular solutions.)</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>And by Vinge's
Principle,</em><br>
<em>if you know exactly what a smart mind would do,</em><br>
<em>you must be at least that smart yourself.<br>
Asking someone "What would an optimal player think is the best
move?"<br>
should produce answers no better than "What do you think is
best?"</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>So what I mean in
practice,</em><br>
<em>when I say Harry is allowed to attain his full potential as a
rationalist,</em><br>
<em>is that Harry is allowed to solve this problem</em><br>
<em>the way YOU would solve it.</em><br>
<em>If you can tell me exactly how to do something,</em><br>
<em>Harry is allowed to think of it.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>But it does not serve as a
solution to say, for example,</em><br>
<em>"Harry should persuade Voldemort to let him out of the
box"</em><br>
<em>if you can't yourself figure out how.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><strong>The rules on Fanfiction
dot Net allow at most one review per chapter.</strong></em><br>
<em><strong>Please submit *ONLY ONE* review of Ch. 113,<br>
to submit one suggested solution.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>For the best experience, if you
have not already been following</em><br>
<em>Internet conversations about recent chapters, I suggest</em>
<em><strong>not</strong></em> <em>doing so,</em><br>
<em>trying to complete this exam on your own,</em><br>
<em>not looking at other reviews,</em><br>
<em>and waiting for Ch. 114 to see how you did.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>I wish you all the best of luck,
or rather the best of skill.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Ch. 114 will post at</em>

<p style="text-align:center;"><em>If you have pending exams,<br>

<em>Like any author, I enjoy the delicious taste of my readers'

<div id="chapter-title">Chapter 112: Failure, Pt 2<br></div><div class="storycontent nocopy" id="storycontent">
<p>Even as Harry had raised the gun, he'd <em>known</em> he was
making a mistake, his forebrain saw it and tried to stop his hand,
but somehow the sick certainty didn't propagate fast enough to
prevent his finger from pulling the trigger -</p>
<p>The echo of the shots died away within the graveyard.</p>
<p>A fraction of a second before Harry had pulled the trigger,
Voldemort had jabbed his wand downward, and a wide wall of dirt had
shot up between them from the graveyard earth, intercepting all
three bullets.</p>
<p>An instant after that, pain flared in Harry's scar, a crawling
feeling came close to his skin; and then Harry's pouch, clothes,
gun, everything except his wand disappeared, leaving him naked but
for the wand still in his right hand, and the glasses he'd Charmed
to stick to his nose. The steel ring upon his left pinky finger was
yanked off hard enough to scrape skin, taking the Transfigured
jewel with it.</p>
<p>"That," said the voice of Voldemort from behind the dirt wall,
"was <em>absolutely</em> predictable. Do you really think I would
shout it aloud for you to hear, if my immortality were disrupted?
Really, stupid child? Lower your wand, do not raise it up again at
any time, or you die upon the spot."</p>
<p>Harry swallowed, and pointed his wand downward. "You would have
been disappointed in me," Harry said, his own voice now unusually
high, "if I'd missed an opportunity like that, I mean." There was
no time to think, and Harry's mouth was operating on autopilot for
trying to placate evil overlords that might have paternal feelings
for you and whom you'd just failed to assassinate.</p>
<p>Voldemort stepped around from behind the dirt wall, smiling that
horrible smile that seemed to contain too many teeth. "I promised
not to raise my hand or wand against you, child, if you did not
raise your hand or wand against me."</p>
<p>"I used bullets," Harry said, his voice still high. "That's not
a fist or a spell."</p>
<p>"My curse thinks differently. That is the puzzle piece that you
missed. Did you think I would leave the peace between us to mere
fortune? Before I created you, I invoked a curse upon myself and
all other Tom Riddles who would descend from me. A curse to enforce
that none of us would threaten the others' immortality, so long as
the other made no attempt upon our own. Typical of that ridiculous
fiasco, the curse seems to have ended up binding me, but taking no
hold upon the infant with his self so lost." A low, lethal chuckle.
"<em>But you tried to end my true life jusst then, sstupid child.
Now cursse iss lifted, and I may kill you any time I
wissh.</em>"</p>
<p>"I see," Harry said. He did see; <em>that</em> was why Voldemort
had told him about his horcrux system in the first place, just to
set up the moment when Harry knowingly tried to violate his
immortality. Harry's mind was frantically churning through options,
none of which seemed helpful. His pouch, his clothes, Harry saw by
the moonlight that they all now lay in another heap by the altar,
out of reach. "And now you kill me?" Harry still had his wand,
presumably the Dark Lord couldn't cast his own magic on that, or
his glasses, because of the disharmony. <em>Cast my own spell
first? No, Voldemort just jabs his wand downward to make another
shield, then shoots me - what else is there? WHAT ELSE?</em></p>
<p>"Still a fool. If no further matters remained between us, I
would already have killed you." The dirt wall crumbled at another
gesture of the wand, and Voldemort moved smoothly back toward the
heap of items by the altar. The Dark Lord stretched out a hand, and
the diary of Roger Bacon flew to him. "<em>Thiss iss, indeed,
horcrux of girl-child, my ssuperior verssion.</em>" In his other
hand appeared a parchment. "<em>Thiss iss ritual for ressurrecting
her, if it musst be done again. Insstructionss are honesst, no
trapss. Remember that girl-child'ss sspirit cannot float free like
ghosst, Ressurrection Sstone iss my horcrux, not herss. Do not
losse her horcrux, or her sspirit may be trapped within it.</em>"
Voldemort reached down, picked up Harry's pouch, fed both the diary
and the parchment into it. "<em>Remember that, in casse something
goess wrong with next movess.</em>"</p>
<p>"I don't understand what is happening," Harry said. There was
nothing else left. "Please explain to me."</p>
<p>The Dark Lord was now regarding Harry with a grim look.
"<em>When girl-child died, wass in company of sschool'ss Sseer,
heard prophecy sspoken that you would become force of vasst
desstruction. You would become threat beyond imagination, beyond
apocalypsse. That iss why I went to ssuch lengthss to undo my
killing of girl-child, keep it undone."</em></p>
<p>"Are," what "are you sure," what.</p>
<p>"<em>Dare not ssay sspecificss to you. Prophecy I heard of
mysself led me to fulfill it. Have not forgotten that
dissasster.</em>" Voldemort backed further away from Harry, red
slitted eyes fixed upon the Boy-Who-Lived, gun unwavering in the
left hand. "<em>All thiss, all I have done, iss to ssmassh that
desstiny at every point of intervention. If ssome fate makess me
fail in what comess next, idiot-child of foretold desstruction,
then you musst kill yoursself to ssave girl-child. Elsse all you
claim to value diess by your own hand.</em>"</p>
<p>"I," Harry's voice went up an octave, "I," another octave, "I
<em>really really wouldn't do that, seriously!"</em></p>
<p>"<em>Ssilence, fool. Remain ssilent unlesss given leave by me to
sspeak. Keep your wand pointed down and do not raisse it unlesss
told. Elsse you die upon the sspot, and mark that I ssaid that in
Parsseltongue."</em> Voldemort reached into the altar again.</p>
<p>For a second Harry's mind couldn't process what he was seeing,
and then he saw that Voldemort was holding a human arm, severed
near the shoulder; it seemed too thin, that arm.</p>
<p>The Dark Lord pressed his wand to the flesh above the severed
arm's elbow, and the fingers twitched, twitched like they were
alive; by dim moonlight Harry saw a darker mark appear on that
flesh, just above the elbow.</p>
<p>Seconds later the first hooded figure appeared inside the
graveyard with the popping sound of an Apparition. A moment after
that came another pop, and then another.</p>
<p>The hooded figures wore silver skull masks, and moonlight fled
from the robes beneath them.</p>
<p>"Master!" cried one of the black robes, the third to arrive. The
voice was of peculiar timbre, from behind the silver skull mask.
"Master - it has been so long - we had lost hope -"</p>
<p>"Silence!" shouted the high voice of the Dark Lord Voldemort.
Every trace of Professor Quirrell was now gone from the too-tall
figure. "Train your wand upon the Boy-Who-Lived, and watch him! Do
not be distracted, not by anything! Stun him at once if he moves,
if he begins to speak!"</p>
<p>More pops. Between graves, behind a tree, in all the shadowy
spaces, more black robes were Apparating, all hooded and masked.
Some of them voiced exclamations of joy, many of those sounding
rather forced; others moved forwards as though to greet their
Master. Voldemort gave them all the same instruction, except that
some were commanded to Cruciate Harry Potter if he moved, others to
restrain the Boy-Who-Lived if he moved, others told to fire hexes
and curses, others told to cancel his magic.</p>
<p>Thirty-seven pops, Harry counted before the black robes and
skull masks seemed to stop arriving.</p>
<p>All of them were now holding their wands pointed at Harry,
aligned in a semicircle before him, where they wouldn't get into
each other's lines of fire.</p>
<p>Harry continued pointing his wand downward, insofar as he had
been told that, if he tried to raise it, he would die. He remained
silent, insofar as he had been told that if he tried to speak, he
would die. He tried not to shiver in the falling night
temperatures, for he was naked, and it was getting colder.</p>
<p><em>You know,</em> said the last voice within Harry, the voice
of hope, <em>I think this is getting pretty bad even by my
standards.</em></p>
